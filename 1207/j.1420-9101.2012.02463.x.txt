Abstract
Theory predicts that geographic variation in traits and genes associated with climatic adaptation may be initially driven by the correlated evolution of thermal preference and thermal sensitivity. This assumes that an organism’s preferred body temperature corresponds with the thermal optimum in which performance is maximized; hence, shifts in thermal preferences affect the subsequent evolution of thermal-related traits. Drosophila subobscura evolved worldwide latitudinal clines in several traits including chromosome inversion frequencies, with some polymorphic inversions being apparently associated with thermal preference and thermal tolerance. Here we show that flies carrying the warm-climate chromosome arrangement O3+4 have higher basal protein levels of Hsp70 than their cold-climate Ost counterparts, but this difference disappears after heat hardening. O3+4 carriers are also more heat tolerant, although it is difficult to conclude from our results that this is causally linked to their higher basal levels of Hsp70. The observed patterns are consistent with the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis and suggest that the interplay between behaviour and physiology underlies latitudinal and seasonal shifts in inversion frequencies.
Introduction
Thermal acclimation is a plastic response that occurs within the lifetime of individuals and triggers a variety of physiological adjustments. This includes the alteration in gene expression and increased heat-shock resistance by prior short-term exposition to sublethal high temperatures (‘hardening’; Hoffmann et al., 2003). The heatinduced heat-shock proteins Hsp70s have for a long time being considered essential for heat stress survival (e.g. Parsell et al., 1993; Sørensen et al., 2003). Hsp70s are a

highly conserved chaperone family that assist in protein folding and mitigate cellular damage during thermal stress, although apparently with a fitness cost to the organism (Krebs & Loeschcke, 1994; Krebs & Feder, 1997a, 1998; Feder et al., 2002). This cost may impose a trade-off to the maximum attained levels of Hsp70, which in Drosophila might extend throughout the life cycle because Hsp70 expression seems to be genetically coupled at larval and adult stages (Krebs et al., 1998; but see Sarup et al., 2006).
However, the actual role played by Hsp70 in the heat tolerance of Drosophila is proving to be a controversial issue. Some studies where manipulation of Hsp70 levels was achieved by using transgenic Drosophila melanogaster larvae have shown that individuals producing more protein improved thermotolerance under laboratory

(Krebs & Feder, 1998; Bettencourt et al., 2008) and fieldlike conditions (Roberts & Feder, 2000); furthermore, standing natural variation of Hsp70 expression also correlates positively with larval thermotolerance (Krebs & Feder, 1997b). On the other hand, weak or no associations between Hsp70 levels and adult thermotolerance have been detected (Dahlgaard et al., 1998; Krebs et al., 1998; Jensen et al., 2010). These contrasting outcomes are somewhat odd in view of the correlated response for increased Hsp70 levels in Drosophila lines selected for adult heat tolerance (Sørensen et al., 1999; Folk et al., 2006), which suggests that these traits are pleiotropically linked.
We have recently uncovered that segregating chromosome arrangements in Drosophila subobscura are associated with differential adult thermal preferences and heat tolerances (Rego et al., 2010). Drosophila subobscura is one of the species with the richest inversion polymorphism in the genus. Compelling evidence that inversions’ latitudinal clines are adaptive in this species is that within a decade after its invasion of South and North America from native European populations, flies evolved latitudinal clines that were generally parallel with clines in the Old World (Prevosti et al., 1985, 1988; Balanya` et al., 2003). Further evidence comes from the long-term shifts in inversion frequencies indicating that the genetic constitution of D. subobscura populations worldwide is responding to climate change (Balanya` et al., 2006). These results suggest that directional selection must be strong, and temperature is a likely selective agent. Consistent with this assumption, we found that flies carrying ‘cold-climate’ chromosome arrangements (i.e. those chromosome arrangements that show a negative correlation coefficient with maximum temperatures along the cline, or a positive correlation coefficient with latitude; Balanya` et al., 2003) prefer lower temperatures and have lower heat tolerances than their ‘warmclimate’ counterparts (Rego et al., 2010). These findings stimulated our assessment of the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis (Dolgova et al., 2010); that is, the idea that behaviour (thermal preference) ‘drives’ evolution in new directions and can speed up physiological (thermotolerance) adaptation (Huey & Bennett, 1987; Angilletta, 2009).
To test the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis, we focused on the largest and inversion richest chromosome O of D. subobscura (Dolgova et al., 2010) because (i) its complex gene arrangements from more equatorial populations – with overlapping inversions in the distal (segment I) and nonoverlapping inversions in the proximal (segment II) segment to the centromere (Krimbas & Loukas, 1980) – are gradually replaced by the standard gene arrangement (Ost) as populations approach high latitudes, (ii) this chromosome is associated with thermal preferences (Rego et al., 2010) and harbours several genes involved in the heat-shock response, including the gene Hsp70 located inside the region covered by the
overlapping inversions 3+4 (Molto ́ et al., 1992) (Fig. 1), and (iii) warm(O3+4) and cold-climate (Ost) chromosome arrangements are highly differentiated for their genetic content in the 3+4 region (Munte ́ et al., 2005). Therefore, we tested whether these gene arrangements could host a set of allelic combinations for thermal preference and thermotolerance that would generate a positive genetic correlation between these two traits in line with the predictions from the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis. Our expectation was that flies’ preferred body temperatures and heat tolerances according to their genetic constitution for chromosome O should agree with the clinal patterns. Although we were able to replicate Rego et al.’s (2010) results showing that O3+4 carriers display a preference for higher temperatures than their Ost counterparts, no difference between these arrangements was detected for heat tolerance (Dolgova etal., 2010). Consequently, we concluded that any correlation between these traits across latitudinal gradients would presumably reflect a pattern of correlated selection rather than genetic correlation (Dolgova et al., 2010).
Considering that inversion polymorphisms in other chromosomes associated with thermotolerance exhibit latitudinal variation in the expected direction (Rego et al., 2010), it is unclear why different arrangements in chromosome O seem to have negligible effects on this trait in our flies. There are at least three possible explanations. First, it might be the case that there is not enough genetic differentiation for Hsp70 between O3+4 and Ost chromosome arrangements. Second, assuming that there is indeed genetic differentiation it might happen that there is no association between Hsp70 protein levels and adult thermotolerance in D. subobscura, in accordance with what has been recently suggested to occur in D. melanogaster (Jensen et al., 2010). Third, flies carrying different arrangements may differ in their plasticity to heat shock, resulting in contrasting patterns

of basal and induced heat tolerance (see Rezende et al., 2011). Consequently, the initial assessment of the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis could be somewhat flawed if the potential fitness benefits of heat-induced thermotolerance under extreme field conditions (Loeschcke & Hoffmann, 2007) were not appropriately assessed in the experiments performed by Dolgova et al. (2010).
In this study, we focus on the latter two alternatives. We first show that warmand cold-climate O chromosome arrangements in D. subobscura are indeed differentiated for basal Hsp70 protein expression levels. We then estimate basal and induced thermotolerance using two different dynamic assays, because measured heat tolerance is known to be affected by variable heating rates (Terblanche et al., 2007; Chown et al., 2009; for a mechanistic explanation of why this may happen, see Rezende et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011). We show that thermal preference and thermotolerance are indeed coupled as predicted from the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis and discuss the confounding factors that have influenced the outcome of the heat tolerance assays in our previous experiments (Dolgova et al., 2010). Finally, we discuss our results in connection with the latitudinal clines and seasonal variation in the frequencies of chromosome O gene arrangements.
Materials and methods
Base stocks and fly handling
The origin and establishment of the 18 isochromosomal lines for the O chromosome in an otherwise highly homogeneous genetic background used in this study have been described elsewhere (Dolgova et al., 2010). Briefly, more than 200 isofemale lines were established from wild flies collected near Barcelona (41°43¢N, 2°13¢E) in October 2007. From each isofemale line, we isolated a single O chromosome by repeatedly backcrossing (for at least five generations) a wild-type male with females from the ch-cu strain, which carries the recessive markers on the O chromosome cherry eyes (ch) and curled wings (cu) and has a highly homogeneous genetic background. The isochromosomal lines were then obtained using the Va ⁄ Ba (Varicose ⁄ Bare) balancer stock, which has the same genetic background than the ch-cu strain. The final isochromosomal lines used in the experiments were the same than the ones used by Dolgova et al. (2010) and included six independent lines for each of the three chromosome arrangements Ost, O3+4, and O3+4+8.
Most frequent chromosome arrangements in Southern Europe carry the inversions O3+4 in segment I and are gradually replaced by arrangement Ost as we move towards the north: the combined frequency of Ost and arrangements carrying 3+4 is generally higher than 70% (Sole ́ et al., 2002; Balanya` et al., 2004). Our main concern here is therefore to test for putative differences in Hsp70
protein expression levels, as well as in basal and inducible heat tolerances between chromosome arrangements O3+4 and Ost. Arrangement O3+4+8 was also included in the study because (i) the gene Hsp70 changed its chromosome position relative to the centromere when inversion O8 arose on a O3+4 chromosome arrangement (Fig. 1), and (ii) it allows us to asses the extent of amongarrangement genetic differentiation for Hsp70 protein expression levels given the reduced recombination rate in the region covered by these arrangements (Pegueroles et al., 2010).
Because outbred individuals are obviously more representative of field conditions than isochromosomal lines, the homokaryotypic O3+4 ⁄ O3+4, O3+4+8 ⁄ O3+4+8 and Ost ⁄ Ost experimental flies were derived from six cyclically permuted reciprocal crosses among the six isochromosomal lines per chromosomal type (i.e. 1 · 2, 2 · 3, , 6 · 1). It is however important to notice that the outbred progeny within each cross is genetically identical, and therefore, the within-cross variation only reflects environmental variance. Flies were always reared at 18 °C, and all fly handling was carried out at room temperature using CO2 anaesthesia only to sort virgin flies.
Thermal exposure conditions
Preliminary experiments using two randomly selected outbred crosses were performed to pinpoint the stressful high temperature most appropriate for the heat hardening treatment to induce the heat-shock response. Heat knockdown times were measured in 30 one-week-old nonvirgin females from each cross. The flies were placed individually in 5-mL glass vials and exposed acutely to 38 or 36 °C by immersion in preheated water baths with capacity for 60 vials each. Water temperature was controlled by a programmable heating unit (JULABO ED; JULABO Labortechnik GmbH, Seelbach, Germany) that also ensured proper water circulation. To minimize measurement error, the flies were video-recorded during the assays with a digital HD video camera (SONY HDRCX110E, Tokyo, Japan), and knockdown times were estimated from the videos. The results (Fig. 2) clearly suggest that 38 °C is close to the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) because all flies were knocked down after 4.8 min (the time required for 50% of the flies to succumb to heat stress was LT50 = 2 min). Flies were able to withstand 36 °C for up to 16 min (LT50 = 9.7 min).
To induce thermotolerance, the experimental flies from each cross were transferred in groups of ten flies (1-week-old nonvirgin females or males) to empty vials (2 · 8 cm) with moistened stoppers to avoid desiccation. Because pre-exposure at 5–6 °C lower than CTmax is usually enough to elicit heat hardening in Drosophila (see Hoffmann et al., 2003), the vials were allocated and evenly spaced in a rack and immersed in a water bath at 32 °C for 1 h (no fly died after this exposure). The flies

were then allowed to recover normal mobility at 18 °C for 2 h to measure Hsp70 protein induction, or for 6 h prior to the heat knockdown assays performed (see below). The heat-shock response requires de novo synthesis of proteins, and a recovery period following hightemperature treatment is often necessary to induce rapid heat hardening (Hoffmann et al., 2003; Chown & Nicolson, 2004).
Hsp70 protein expression
Following the heat-shock treatment and the 2-h recovery time, flies were placed in Eppendorf tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at )80 °C until the level of Hsp70 protein expression was assayed. Control flies from both sexes for each cross kept at 18 °C were also frozen to quantify the basal level of Hsp70.
Flies from each replicated group were homogenized in 1.0 mL of homogenizing mix (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO). Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 13 226 g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to two 0.5-mL microtubes and stored on ice. The total protein concentration in the supernatant was determined from quadruplicate 10-lL samples in a 96-well microplate with a BCA assay (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and standardized against bovine serum albumin diluted in sterile distilled water.
Hsp70 concentrations from whole animal lysates were quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with an Hsp70-specific monoclonal primary antibody (clone 5A5, dilution 1:1000 PBS; Thermo Scientific Inc., Bremen, Germany) and a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG; ThermoScientific)
following the ELISA protocol described in Sørensen et al. (1999). Colour reaction was measured with a spectophotometric microplate reader (PowerWave XS2 Biotek, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany) at 490 nm. Each plate contained 23 samples (heat-induced or control, randomly distributed) and a standard (see below) in four replicates. A blank (without primary antibody) of each sample and standard was included to allow corrections for a nonspecific signal.
The Hsp70 standard was derived from all different crosses after mixing flies to set up a mass population from which two groups of 45 individuals each were hardened as previously described. Data were standardized before statistical analysis. One randomly selected ELISA plate was used as the reference plate, and the standard value of this plate was used to obtain a correction factor for the rest.
Adult heat tolerance assays
Basal and hardened heat tolerances were measured on six females and six males from each of the performed homokaryotype crosses involving the O3+4 and Ost isochromosomal lines. Because the water baths have capacity for sixty 5-mL glass vials, only five cyclically permuted reciprocal crosses within each chromosomal type were assayed. Three females and three males from each cross were individually placed in sealed empty vials and immersed in two water baths for each treatment.
Heat knockdown temperature was scored as the temperature for individual flies to be knocked down and immobilized in a dynamic assay, where temperature is increased at a constant rate until the end point is observed. Estimates of heat knockdown temperature can however vary dramatically depending on the methodology employed (Terblanche et al., 2007; Chown et al., 2009), which may be partially explained as a result of the varying levels of physiological stress, dehydration and so on experienced by the flies when enclosed in sealed empty vials immersed in a water bath for different periods of time (Rezende et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011). We therefore used two different experimental protocols to measure basal and hardened heat tolerance: a slow ramping protocol with initial temperature T0 = 24 °C and heating rate DT = 0.1 °C min)1 as in Dolgova et al. (2010), and a fast ramping assay with T0 = 24 °C and DT = 0.6 °C min)1. In both cases, an equilibration time of 10 min was allowed before increasing temperature.
Measurement error was of some concern in the fast ramping assays because the water baths would reach the estimated acute CTmax of 38 °C (see above) in approximately 23 min. We therefore placed a thermocouple in the water baths, video-recorded the flies and the temperature displayed by the thermocouple (nearest 0.1 °C), and estimated the heat knockdown temperature of each fly from the time point at which it collapsed

In this expression, Tk is the estimated knockdown temperature, Ti is the temperature of the thermocouple at time ti just before the fly was knocked down, and tk is the recorded time when the fly was knocked down. The videos were analysed twice (each time by a different observer), and measurement error was estimated as one minus the intraclass correlation coefficient obtained from the oneway ANOVA (Sokal & Rohlf, 1995, p. 213).

Hsp70 levels between the warm(O3+4 ⁄ O3+4) and cold-climate (Ost ⁄ Ost) homokaryotypes for those gene arrangements that show more significant opposite latitudinal clines (Balanya` et al., 2003) were compared by means of linear contrasts (each comparison or contrast between two
means has one degree of freedom).
A similar linear model was used to analyse heat
tolerance. Because the variance in knockdown temperature was significantly higher under slow ramping (Levene’s F1,472 = 23.40, P < 0.001), the data from the different dynamic assays were analysed separately. An additional reason to perform separate analyses is that the confounding sources of error to reliably estimate heat tolerance are more important in longer assays (i.e. under slow ramping; Rezende et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011). Analyses were performed using the statistical packages STATISTICA 9.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA) and SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Induction of Hsp70 protein levels after the heat shock
Global protein levels of Hsp70 increased after the heatshock treatment as expected, with no significant sex or sex · treatment interaction effects (Table 1). Overall differences among the three homokaryotypes were also detected, and it was clear from the linear contrast that the warm-climate homokaryotype O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 had higher Hsp70 protein levels on average (around 5% higher) than its cold-climate Ost ⁄ Ost counterpart. However, an interesting and somewhat unexpected karyotype · treat-
ment interaction effect was also observed (Table 1, Fig. 3). Thus, the comparatively high basal protein level of Hsp70 in O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 homokaryotypes did not increase after the heat shock, whereas it boosted by around 30% in both O3+4+8 ⁄ O3+4+8 and Ost ⁄ Ost flies. Following heat induction, the three homokaryotypes reached similar Hsp70 protein levels (Fig. 3). The linear contrast comparing O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 vs. Ost ⁄ Ost for the karyotype · treatment interaction effect clearly indicates that these warmand cold-climate homokaryotypes behave quite differently for Hsp70 protein levels according to basal or heat-induced conditions, whereas

Basal and hardened heat tolerance
Results for the adult heat tolerance assays are plotted in Fig. 4. Measurement error in the fast ramping protocol, estimated as one minus the intraclass correlation coefficient between the two knockdown temperatures calculated from the recorded videos, was 18%. The qualitative conclusions remained the same for each estimated knockdown temperature, and we used the average of the two values as our measure of heat tolerance.
The average knockdown temperature with slow ramping (mean ± SD: 35.07 ± 1.57 °C) was substantially lower than with fast ramping (37.59 ± 1.19 °C). This is in accordance with what had been observed by Chown et al. (2009) for D. melanogaster and is also expected from our theoretical treatment of ramping effects on heat tolerance (Rezende et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011). Pearson correlation coefficients between knockdown temperatures across ramping conditions, using the
pooled (basal and hardened separately) within-cross average knockdown temperature as the relevant variables (recall that that the outbred progeny within each cross is genetically identical), were not statistically different from zero in any case (Table 2).
An increase in heat tolerance following heat hardening was observed with slow ramping but not with fast ramping (Table 3). Conversely, differences between karyotypes were only detected with fast ramping: O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 flies had a higher knockdown temperature than their Ost ⁄ Ost counterparts (37.77 vs. 37.41 °C). Yet, the marginally significant karyotype · sex interaction effect under slow ramping indicates that O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 females also had a higher knockdown temperature than Ost ⁄ Ost females, whereas males had about the same heat tolerance regardless karyotype. Also important is that in no case was the karyotype · treatment (basal and hardened heat tolerance) interaction effect statistically significant.
Discussion
The striking observations on differences between warm(O3+4) and cold-climate (Ost) chromosome arrangements arising from this study are (i) the sustained higher protein levels of Hsp70 in O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 homokaryotypes under basal conditions, (ii) the higher basal thermotolerance of O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 females under slow ramping and (iii) the slightly higher basal and heat-induced thermotolerance of both O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 females and males when compared to their Ost ⁄ Ost counterparts under fast ramping. The lack of induction of Hsp70 in O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 flies might be due to a higher temperature threshold for induction than that required for Ost ⁄ Ost and O3+4+8 ⁄ O3+4+8 flies (Fig. 3). We however find this explanation unlikely because the stressful temperature used for heat hardening is about 10 °C above the upper bound of the ‘set point’ (Tset) range (central 50% of preferred body temperatures; Hertz et al., 1993) for the warm-climate homokaryotype O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 (Tset = 16.6–22.2 °C; Dolgova et al., 2010) and only 3.2 °C below its average knockdown temperature under slow ramping. It seems therefore reasonable to assume that our thermal exposure conditions (see Materials and methods) should have triggered rapid heat hardening induction in all homokaryotypes tested in the experiments.
Overproduction of Hsp70 at normal temperatures has deleterious consequences on Drosophila cells (Feder et al., 1992) and adversely impacts larval development (Krebs & Feder, 1997a) and female fecundity (Krebs & Loeschcke, 1994). These studies have led to the idea that the existing copy number of Hsp70 in D. melanogaster (six copies of Hsp70 per haploid genome; Gong & Golic, 2004) represents a balance between selection for its chaperone function under stress conditions and against its deleterious effects on fitness (Feder & Hofmann, 1999). As stated by Sørensen (2010, p. 705), ‘it is not always clear when the level of constitutive and inducible heat-shock protein

However, no clines were observed for this arrangement in the colonized area (Balanya` et al., 2003) and recent studies show that O3+4+8 is dramatically increasing its frequency in Northern European populations (Rezende et al., 2010), which raises some caveats on the putative status of O3+4+8 as a warm-climate gene arrangement. Thus, the contrasting pattern of O3+4 in front of the other two arrangements could be due to differences in the genetic content of this warm adapted arrangement. Two hypothesis could explain the higher levels of Hsp70 expression in the O3+4 arrangement. On the one hand, basal thermotolerance has been found to be positively associated with hsp70 copy number in D. melanogaster (Bettencourt et al., 2008); thus, in D. subobscura different copy number of the hsp70 genes in the different arrangements, with a higher number in the O3+4 arrangement, could explain the results encountered. On the other hand variation in the cis-regulatory region could lead to differences in the genetic expression of this gene as found in D. melanogaster (Bettencourt et al., 2002). However, further analyses are needed to determine which hypothesis is more likely.
If the degree of thermotolerance in our flies were entirely dependent on Hsp70 protein levels, we would expect Ost ⁄ Ost flies to have about the same average knockdown temperature than their O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 counterparts after the heat-induced treatment, when Hsp70 levels were about the same across karyotypes (Fig. 3). However, no significant karyotype · treatment interaction was detected in any case (hardening effects were also absent under fast ramping). It is therefore difficult to conclude from our present results that the high basal levels of Hsp70 in the warm-climate O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 karyotypes are causally linked to their higher basal thermotolerance.

 The pooled within-cross average knockdown temperatures were used as the relevant variables. In no case was the correlation coefficient statistically different from zero after a sequential Bonferroni correction.
(Hsp) expression should be interpreted as reflecting the capacity or ability to mount a strong defense (i.e. as a benefit) or when it should be interpreted as reflecting the need to mount a strong response as the organism is stressed (i.e. as a cost)’. If this cost-benefit reasoning applies to D. subobscura, the question immediately arises: Why are the basal protein levels of Hsp70 in O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 homokaryotypes about the same than those attained by Ost ⁄ Ost flies after heat hardening induction? The seemingly obvious explanation is that Southern European populations, where the frequency of chromosome arrangement O3+4 is relatively high (Sole ́ et al., 2002), are more likely exposed to occasionally high temperatures than populations located at higher latitudes, and the benefits of mounting the stress response might be outweighed by the costs. This is in accordance with active flies having much lower body temperature in cooler seasons and at higher latitudes (Huey & Pascual, 2009). Interestingly, the opposite seasonal fluctuations between Ost and O3+4 carrying flies observed in an extensively studied population, where O3+4 consistently increases in summer and decreases in winter (Rodrı ́guez-Trelles et al., 1996), also seems to favour this interpretation. O3+4+8 has traditionally being considered a ‘warm-climate’ chromosome arrangement although its negative correla-

study (Dahlgaard et al., 1998; Krebs et al., 1998; Sørensen et al., 1999; Folk et al., 2006; Jensen et al., 2010). One suggested reason for this is that the different experimental protocols used to assess CTmax seemingly capture different physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying thermotolerance because estimates (knockdown temperatures or times) are poorly correlated (Sgro` et al., 2010). We have also detected a relatively low correlation between knockdown temperatures assessed under slow or fast ramping, but doubt this is because our heat tolerance assays are estimating different things. A more reasonable explanation is that the amount of experimental noise introduced by methodology to reliably estimate heat tolerance is substantial, as suggested by the low repeatability of this trait (about 0.2; Krebs & Loeschcke, 1997) and confirmed by our theoretical treatment, showing that many experimental protocols result in unreliable and highly biased estimates of CTmax (Santos et al., 2011).
We have recently recommended that ramping rates in experiments aiming at studying thermal tolerance should be as fast as possible to minimize the contribution of uncontrolled variables (e.g. depletion of resources during assays, short-term acclimatory responses and stochasticity effects; Rezende et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011). More important in the present context is that slow ramping protocols can grossly underestimate underlying genetic differences in critical thermal limits (Rezende et al., 2011), which might explain why karyotype variation in heat stress resistance was not detected in our previous experiment (Dolgova et al., 2010). We therefore believe that the present results with the fast ramping assay provide a more accurate representation of the genetic differences in heat tolerance between Ost ⁄ Ost and O3+4⁄O3+4 flies.
In summary, our study clearly suggests that warmclimate karyotypes in D. subobscura are better able to cope with high stressful temperatures than their cold-climate counterparts. Combined with their consistent differences in thermal preferences (i.e. O3+4 carriers display a higher thermal preference than Ost ones; Dolgova et al., 2010), we now conclude (Dolgova et al.’s claims notwithstanding) that the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis does find some support in this species and might also adaptively explain its diurnal activity patterns in summer, where O3+4 carriers are more active at midday (Savkovic ́ et al., 2004). However, the causal link between the comparatively high basal levels of Hsp70 heat-shock protein and high adult heat tolerance of O3+4 ⁄ O3+4 flies is not yet clear-cut.
