1. Introduction
First placed in the genus Arvicola (Lacepede, 1799) then included in the genus Microtus (Schrank, 1798), snow voles were later elevated to their own genus, Chionomys, by Miller (1908) only to be subsequently demoted to subgenus (Miller, 1912). This status was maintained over decades in the literature and all major synthe- ses of vole systematics (e.g., Andera and Leffler, 1981; Corbet, 1978; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1966; Krapp, 1982). More recently, snow voles were re-elevated to full genus level based on multiple criteria (reviewed in Musser and Carleton, 1993). The three currently recognized species inhabit the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia Minor, and Western Asia. All three species occur in the Caucasus. Two of them, the Gudaur Snow Vole, Chionomys gud (Satunin, 1909), and the Robert’s Snow Vole, Chionomys roberti (Thomas, 1906), are endemic to the Caucasus and Asia Minor. In con- trast, the European Snow Vole, Chionomys nivalis (Martins, 1842), occupies a much larger distribution, ranging from the Kopet-Dag (South Turkmenistan) and the Binaloud Mountains (Northeastern Iran) in the east to the Sierra Nevada (Spain) in the west.
Due to its rock-dwelling lifestyle in alpine habitats, the distribu- tion of the European Snow Vole is highly patchy and the species is mostly restricted to altitudes from 1500 to 3000 m a.s.l., although

abstract
To elucidate the evolutionary history of snow voles, genus Chionomys, we studied the phylogeography of Chionomys nivalis across its range and investigated its relationships with two congeneric species, Chionomys gud and Chionomys roberti, using independent molecular markers. Analyses were based on mitochondrial (􏰁940 bp cyt b) and Y-chromosomal (􏰁2020 bp from three introns) genetic variation. Our data provide conclusive evidence for a Caucasian and Middle Eastern origin for the three species and a subsequent westward expansion of C. nivalis. In addition, we discuss the taxonomic status of the genus Chionomys in relation to the genus Microtus.

it can also be found in rocky habitats close to sea level (Amori, 1999). Within this discontinuous distribution, populations are highly isolated, and considerable morphological diversity is found among populations (Amori, 1999). Consequently, a large number of subspecies have been described based on morphology. Corbet (1978) recognized four subspecies, while 13 were distinguished by Krapp (1982), 16 by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1966) and Kratochvil (1981), and up to 18 subspecies have been listed by Nadachowski (1991) in the most comprehensive revision. Allozyme variation in European populations revealed an alpine clade and a clade including populations from Italy, France and Spain (Graf, 1982). Analyses employing extended sampling from the Alps suggested a double colonization from the west and the east, with the Middle Eastern population from Mount Hermon occupying a basal position (Filippucci et al., 1991).
The reconstruction of the genus’ evolutionary history has proved challenging in the past, and the phylogeographic origin of Chionomys remains unclear. Nadachowski (1991) reconstructed the phylogeography of all three species based on tooth morphol- ogy. Like other subsequent authors (e.g., Chaline et al., 1999), he postulated a split between Chionomys and Microtus from an ances- tral Allophaiomys sp. during the Lower Pleistocene. According to Nadachowski (1991) fossils of C. nivalis appeared simultaneously in Europe and Asia Minor in the Middle Pleistocene, with C. n. leucurus and C. n. lebrunii from France being the most primitive morphotypes. An eastward expansion of this species from Europe to Turkey (C. n. spitzenbergerae), the Caucasus (C. n. trialeticus)
   
 and Kopet-Dag (C. n. dementievi) followed. In contrast, fossils of C. gud and C. roberti appeared in the Caucasus only in the Upper Pleis- tocene, and the two species are currently restricted to this region (i.e., the Caucasus and Minor Asia). The mitochondrial phylogeog- raphy of C. nivalis recently published by Castiglia et al. (2009), including samples from Spain to Syria and Turkey, supports Nadachowski’s (1991) hypothesis of a European origin of C. nivalis and a subsequent eastward expansion during the Middle Pleisto- cene. Based on morphological criteria, Kryštufek (1999) also hypothesized a European origin for C. nivalis and an eastern origin of C. gud and C. roberti. According to these studies, speciation would have taken place in the area of the Bosphorus land bridge, where the land connection between Europe and Asia was frequently disrupted by Pleistocene sea level oscillations (Kerey et al., 2004). However, paleontological data do not provide conclu- sive evidence supporting the European origin of C. nivalis. Rather, they show that during the Middle Pleistocene, C. nivalis was already widespread in Europe (Kowalski, 2001) and in Asia Minor (Kryštufek and Vohralik, 2005), contradicting the molecular dating of the species’ eastward expansion (Castiglia et al., 2009).
In order to elucidate the evolutionary history of the genus Chionomys, we studied the phylogeography of C. nivalis over its entire range and investigated the relationships among all three spe- cies of Chionomys based on variation in mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA. Our analyses support a Caucasian origin of the genus and a subsequent westward expansion of C. nivalis. In addition, we discuss the ambiguous taxonomic status of Chionomys in relation to the genus Microtus.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Specimens
We obtained tissue samples as (1) ethanol-preserved tissues ta- ken from voucher specimens in the IZEA collection of Musée de Zoologie (Lausanne, Switzerland), and from the Zoological Institute of Saint Petersburg (Russia), and (2) eight DNA extracts kindly pro- vided by Peter Wandeler, Zoologisches Museum, Universität Zürich (Switzerland). A total of 34 specimens representing 7 Chionomys species or subspecies were analyzed for variation in the mitochon- drial cytochrome b gene (cyt b) and in three Y-chromosome introns (see Fig. 1 and Table 1 for details). Due to its male-only strict paternal inheritance and a slow mutation rate relative to mtDNA, information from Y-chromosomal variation is expected to shed light on the evolutionary history at a more ancient timescale.
Mitochondrial DNA only provides information about the female germ line and the rapid evolution of mtDNA makes it prone to mutational saturation (homoplasy) over long evolutionary time- scales, unlike the mammalian Y-chromosome. Therefore, studying both mtDNA and the Y chromosome should enable comparative analysis of genes with different patterns of inheritance and also of recent and ancient evolutionary history.
Our sample included three C. nivalis subspecies (nivalis, trialeticus and dementievi) out of the 18 listed by Nadachowski (1991), and each two subspecies of C. gud (gud and lghesicus) and C. roberti (personnatus and occidentalis). Additional cyt b sequences represent- ing seven C. nivalis subspecies, and one C. gud and two C. roberti sequences published previously were included in the data set; their GenBank accession numbers are given in Table 2. Microtus agrestis and M. arvalis were used as outgroups, and Arvicola terrestris was used to root all trees based on the results of Fink et al. (2006) and Galewski et al. (2006).
Insufficient taxon sampling is often cited as a major source of error in phylogenetic analysis (see for example Hillis et al., 2003 and references therein). Therefore, to infer the phylogenetic rela- tionships between Chionomys and closely related genera and other arvicoline species, 77 sequences representing 17 arvicoline genera (10 out of the 11 recognized arvicoline tribes; sensu Musser and Carleton, 1993) were retrieved from GenBank (for origin and acces- sion numbers see Supplementary Table S1). This second dataset in- cluded 51 Microtus species and notably Microtus gregalis (Stenocranius), the phylogenetic position of which in relation to Chionomys and other Microtus was ambiguous in previous analyses of the cyt b data (i.e., Buzan and Kryštufek, 2008; Jaarola et al., 2004). Cricetulus barabensis from the subfamily Cricetinae and Peromyscus truei from the subfamily Neotominae, thought to be two sister clades to Arvicolinae (Michaux et al., 2001) were used as outgroups.
Mitochondrial fragments that have been integrated into the nu- clear genome (numt pseudogenes) are not rare in Arvicolinae and can cause problems in phylogenetic and phylogeographic inference if numts are inadvertently included among mitochondrial se- quences (Triant and DeWoody, 2007, 2008). We evaluated the mitochondrial origin of cyt b sequences by checking for the pres- ence of indels, frame-shift mutations, or premature stop codons that would suggest a nuclear origin (Triant and DeWoody, 2009).
In addition, we used all published data to reconstruct concate- nated sequence trees based on nuclear information available on GenBank for C. nivalis and nine Microtus species (M. oeconomus, M. arvalis, M. kikuchii, M. ochrogaster, M. richardsoni, M. chrotorrhinus, M. longicaudus, M. thomasi and M. agrestis). This analysis included

tion of the Y-chromosome introns carried out in a final volume of 25 ll containing 1􏰇 PCR buffer, 0.2 lM of each primer, 200 lM dNTPs, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 U Taq polymerase (QIAgen). PCR con- ditions included an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, fol- lowed by a touchdown program including 40 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, T°Cannealing for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, where anneal- ing temperature was decreased from 55 to 45 °C (UTY11) or from 60° to 50 °C (DBY7 and DBY14) by 0.5 °C/cycle in the first 20 cycles and followed by 20 cycles at the lower annealing temperature (i.e., 45 °C or 50 °C, respectively) and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min (see Yannic et al. (2008), for details). The specificity of Y- chromosome primers was determined by the absence of amplifica- tion products in females. PCRs were performed on a GeneAmp PCR Systems 2700 or 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
PCR products were checked on a 1% agarose electrophoresis gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining to verify PCR qual- ity. Purification of PCR products was conducted using the WizardÒ Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Direct sequencing was performed using the Big Dye 3.1 Terminator cycle- sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and nucleotide sequences were determined using an ABI PRISM 3130XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA, USA).
2.3. Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences were edited in mega 4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007) and aligned using clustalx 2.0.12 (Thompson et al., 1997) using default parameters and then visually inspected, manually corrected and collapsed into haplotypes using DnaSP 5.10.01 (Librado and Rozas, 2009). The models of DNA substitution were selected using JMODELTEST 0.1.1 (Posada, 2008), based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The GTR + G + I model and HKY substi- tution models best fitted the cyt b dataset and the three Y-chromo- some introns, respectively. The best-fitting nucleotide substitution model for non-coding nuclear gene and each codon position per coding nuclear gene was also evaluated using jMODELTEST according to the AIC. Based on these selected substitution models, phyloge- netic trees were constructed using Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods. ML heuristic searches and bootstrap analyses (1000 replicates) were performed using PHYML 3.0 (Guindon et al., 2010; Guindon and Gascuel, 2003), optimizing the topology with both simultaneous NNI and SPR, using a BioNJ starting tree and adding 5 SPR tree searches using random starting trees. For cyt b and nuclear genes, BI was conducted using MRBAYES 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003), using a full partition strategy (i.e., each codon position for each coding gene was entered in a separate partition; Y-chromo- some introns and concatenated alignments). The analyses were performed on concatenated sequences for the Y-chromosome, with an additional binary character matrix representing the presence/ absence of indels and non-sequenced positions were treated as missing data in subsequent analyses (see Table 1). For all BI, two independent runs were performed, each consisting of four parallel MCMC chains of ten million generations. Trees were sampled every 1000 generations. To assess convergence among MCMC runs, the trends and distributions of log-likelihoods and parameter values were examined in TRACER 1.4 (Rambaut and Drummond, 2007), and the correlations of split frequencies among runs were exam- ined in awty (Nylander et al., 2008). Samples showed patterns con- sistent with stationarity and convergence after at most one million generations for all runs and data sets; hence the first 10% of sam- ples were discarded as burn-in for all analyses. The remaining trees were used to construct a 50% majority rule consensus tree. Node support was estimated using non-parametric bootstrap values

2.2. DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAgen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (QIAgen, Germantown, MD, USA). Double- stranded DNA amplifications of partial cyt b were performed with primers L14841 and H15915 (Irwin et al., 1991; Kocher et al., 1989). PCR amplification was performed in a final volume of 25 ll generally containing 50–100 ng DNA. Cyt b amplification reaction contained 1􏰇 PCR buffer, 0.4 lM each primer, 200 lM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 U Taq polymerase (QIAgen, German- town, MD, USA), with cycling conditions as follow: 95 °C for 4 min, 40cyclesat94°Cfor30s,58°Cfor1minand72°Cfor2min,and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. Y-chromosome intron sequences (DBY7, DBY14 and UTY11) were obtained using Y-CATS primer pairs developed by Hellborg and Ellegren (2003). Amplifica-

(BVs) (1000 replicates) in PhyML and posterior probabilities (PPs) in MrBayes. Median-joining (MJ) networks (Bandelt et al., 1999) depicting the evolutionary relationships among the cyt b haplo- types were inferred with Network 4.2.0.1 (http://www.fluxus- technology.com). The sequences were deposited in GenBank (see Table 1).
2.4. Molecular dating
We estimated divergence times with Beast 1.5.4 (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007) using a coalescent tree prior, which is ade- quate to study intraspecific diversification (Drummond et al., 2007). Many systematic uncertainties remain in the genus Micro- tus. Whereas the fossil record seems to indicate that separation of Chionomys from Microtus occurred less than 1.0 􏰇 106 years ago (Myr), biochemical data suggest that isolation of Chionomys took place more than 2.4 Myr (Chaline and Graf, 1988). A fossil re- cord is missing for most extant Microtus species, or it appears rel- atively late (Tamarin, 1985). Clock calibration was therefore based on the assumption of a Late Pliocene radiation of the basal lineages of Microtus (Chaline and Graf, 1988). To account for uncertainty of the calibration date, we used 0.2Myr as its standard error. Preliminary analyses were performed with an uncorrelated lognor- mal relaxed clock to test if a strict molecular clock can be rejected (ucld.stdev parameter >1 with a frequency histogram not abutting 0). Because in our simulation the mean of the ‘‘ucld.stdev’’ param- eter was 0.1 with a frequency histogram abutting 0, we chose a strict molecular clock for the final analyses (Drummond et al., 2007). Analyses were performed with two independent chains and 10 million generations; chains were sampled every 1000 gen- erations with a burn-in of 2 million generations. We selected an appropriate burn-in based on examination of the trends and distri- butions of log-likelihoods and parameter values using TRACER 1.4 (Rambaut and Drummond, 2007).
3. Results
3.1. Chionomys and other Arvicolinae: cytochrome b gene and nuclear genes
The 941 bp analyzed for cyt b among arvicoline species showed 450 (48%) variable sites, of which 403 (43%) were parsimony- informative and 47 (5%) were singletons. No insertions or deletions were observed. The two phylogenetic methods yielded an identical topology of the main branches; only the topology from BI is shown (Fig. 2). The phylogenetic reconstruction revealed strong support for the monophyly of Microtus (and its allies Blanfordimys and Neodon)–Chionomys–Stenocranius (0.98/80), in a trichotomous relationship. The monophyly of Chionomys is evident (1.00/96) and Microtus emerged as paraphyletic with respect to Blanfordimys and Neodon. Chionomys is definitively related to Microtus and more phylogenetically distant to Arvicola, which was expected to be a sister genus to the clade of Microtus and its relatives. The phyloge- netic position of Arvicola was, however, actually poorly resolved and Lagurus lagurus emerged as the closest sister genus of the clade with Microtus–Chionomys–Stenocranius (0.92/82), as previously shown by others (e.g., Buzan et al., 2008).
A tree based on the combined nuclear sequences from IRBP (653 pb), GHR (860 bp), UPSTREAM (698 bp) and EXON1 (783 bp), showed C. nivalis as an offshoot of the Microtus species, irrespective of their region of origin (Nearctic: M. ochrogaster, M. richardsoni, M. chrotorrhinus, and M. longicaudus; Europe: M. arvalis, M. agrestis and M. thomasi; Asia: M. kikuchii; Holarctic: M. oeconomus). Phylogenies based on BI and ML methods revealed the same tree topologies (Fig. 3).
3.2. Chionomys: cytochrome b
The 41 Chionomys sequences of 941bp used in this study showed 348 (37%) variable sites, of which 298 (32%) were parsi- mony-informative. No insertions or deletions were observed. The two phylogenetic methods yielded identical topologies of the main branches; only the topology from BI is shown (Fig. 4A). Each of the three species within Chionomys had strong support (Fig. 4A). Their respective origin is polytomic, although C. gud and C. roberti seem to be more closely related (but supported only by BI: 0.98/n.s.). Within C. gud, the two subspecies gud and lghesicus from Georgia and Dagestan, respectively, group together. The genetic differenti- ation between the two subspecies is not supported at all, while the specimen from Çam Geçidi (Ardahan, Turkey) is more phylogenet- ically distant. Within C. roberti, the two subspecies (C. r. occidentalis from Adygeya and C. r. personnatus from Northern Ossetia, Georgia and Turkey) have strong support (1.00/93).
Chionomys nivalis shows a strongly-supported basal dichotomy between C. n. dementievi (1.00/99) from Turkmenistan and all other specimens. The monophyly of the remaining C. nivalis subspecies is well supported (0.98/84) and several geographical groupings can be recognized. The first well-supported clade subspecies from the Caucasus (C. n. trialeticus), Turkey (C. n. cedrorum) and Israel (C. n. hermonis) (1.00/81). The second, poorly-supported group con- tains specimens from western European subspecies, i.e., subspecies from Slovenia and Macedonia (1.00/95), Slovakia, Spain (1.00/98), and from the Alps and the Apennine. The samples from the Alps and the Apennine are divided into two clades (0.99/88 and 1.00/ 93, respectively).
3.3. Chionomys: Y-chromosome
The concatenation of the three Y-chromosome introns (DBY7, DBY14 and UTY11) produced a 2027 bp alignment comprising 24 different haplotypes. These exhibit 1493 informative sites, of which 54 are parsimony informative, and numerous insertions and deletions. The two methods (BI and ML) yielded similar results and only the results from BI are presented (Fig. 4B). The phylogeny obtained from the Y-chromosome introns is in agreement with re- sults from cyt b, though the relationships between clades are par- tially unresolved (presumably due to the lower polymorphism inherent to Y-chromosomes). According to the Y-chromosome phylogeny, C. roberti and C. gud formed a strongly -supported clade (1.0/91), which is clearly differentiated from C. nivalis. Subspecies differentiations within these taxa are, however, poorly supported. No differentiation between C. g. gud and C. g. lghesicus haplotypes was observed. A polytomy within C. roberti does not allow differen- tiating C. r. personnatus from C. r. occidentalis with confidence. Importantly, these results further support the basal position of the haplotypes of the most eastern subspecies, C. n. dementievi, within C. nivalis. The sampling within other C. nivalis taxa is scarce and does not allow for further inference of phylogenetic relation- ships within C. nivalis.
3.4. Molecular dating
The dating analyses suggested an initial divergence between Microtus and Chionomys about 2.35 Myr (95% HPD: 1.94-2.73; with a calibration point from Chaline and Graf, 1988). The subsequent basal radiation of Chionomys was dated to 1.77 Myr (95% HPD: 1.36–2.19). C. roberti and C. gud diverged 1.48 Myr ago (95% HPD: 1.10–1.85). The basal radiation of C. roberti took place 0.299 Myr ago (95% HPD: 0.186–0.417) and the diversification of C. gud was dated to about 1.067 Myr (95% HPD: 0.766–1.397). The basal radi- ation of C. nivalis occurred 0.597 Myr ago (95% HPD: 0.417–0.794), when C. nivalis dementievi and the other C. nivalis subspecies

4. Discussion
4.1. Phylogenetic origin of the genus Chionomys
There is a great deal of controversy regarding the systematics of the taxon Chionomys. The genus was originally treated as subgenus of Microtus for over 60 years (since Miller, 1912). Chionomys was la- ter recognized as an independent genus based on isozymes (Graf and Scholl, 1975). Graf (1982) further supported this taxonomic position using isozymes again and showed an earlier divergence among Chionomys and the sister taxa Arvicola–Microtus, in agreement with paleontological data (Chaline and Graf, 1988). Taxonomic studies based on morphological traits later lead to the same conclusion (Gromov and Polyakov, 1992). Since then, the generic rank has not been debated (reviewed in Musser and Carleton, 1993; Nadachowski, 1991). Thereafter, several studies attempted to use molecular markers to resolve the phylogenetic position of Chionomys with regard to other Microtus species. Based on the cyt b gene, Jaarola et al. (2004) corroborated the ranking of Chionomys as a genus separate from Microtus. However, according to this study,

In contrast, Buzan and Kryštufek (2008) sug- gested a Chionomys + M. gregalis clade, resulting in a problematic paraphyly of the genus Microtus. Combined data from the mitochon- drial cyt b gene and the nuclear GHR gene revealed a basal position of Chionomys in the Microtus phylogeny with Arvicola placed at the base of Arvicolini (Galewski et al., 2006). Robovsky et al. (2008) reached the same conclusion by adding morphological characters to cyt b and GHR data sets. They found Chionomys consistently placed as a sister group of the rest of Microtus (Robovsky et al., 2008). The diver- gence between Chionomys and Microtus after the split leading to Arvicola was also shown by the combined analyses of the nuclear genes GHR and LCAT (Abramson et al., 2009). A recent genome-wide approach based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and several DNA sequence markers showed C. nivalis as a basal offshoot of the other Microtus species for all but one marker, for which C. nivalis grouped within other Microtus species (Fink et al., 2010). The comprehensive species data set used in the present cyt b study includes all three recognized Chionomys species, in addi- tion to 51 Microtus species (including M. gregalis), and 23 additional sequences, representing 10 out the 11 recognized arvicoline tribes. The results obtained suggest a closer phylogenetic position of Chionomys to Microtus and more distantly related to Arvicola. Our results thereby contradict the earlier conclusion of Graf and Scholl (1975) on a ancestral position of Chionomys to the clade including Microtus and Arvivola. The suggested sister relationship between
M. gregalis (Stenocranius) and Chionomys (Buzan and Kryštufek, 2008) was not observed; it appeared with Chionomys and the main lineages of Microtus as a trichotomy. Our total evidence analyses based on four nuclear gene markers suggest a basal position of C. nivalis with respect to Microtus. At this stage, no objective criteria al- low us to conclude on the generic or subgeneric status of Chionomys. Recent publications included Chionomys as a subgenus of Microtus (Chaline et al., 1999; Fink et al., 2010). The particular petricolous lifestyle of most Chionomys species (C. roberti is found in forest hab- itat; Kryštufek and Vohralik, 2005) distinguishes this taxon from Microtus and may be an argument in favor of generic ranking. However, considering the subjective nature of Linnean categories, no objective criterion can be used to assign rank of taxa (e.g., see Dubois, 2007; Laurin, 2010). A solution is to include Chionomys and Stenocranius as subgenera of the genus Microtus. This is not only justified by the close phylogenetic relationships, but also by the avoidance of a paraphyletic taxon.
4.2. Phylogenetic relationships among Chionomys species
MtDNA and Y-chromosome molecular evidence suggest a divi- sion of Chionomys into two monophyletic lineages, the nivalis and roberti/gud groups. This division is also supported by dental morpho- logical data (Nadachowski, 1991) and differences in the fundamen- tal number of chromosomal arms (Zima and Král, 1984). Our molecular clock reconstruction estimates this split to have occurred in the Lower Pleistocene (1.77 Myr, 95% HPD: 1.36-2.19), while fossil data estimate it to have taken place later in the Early Pleistocene (Nadachowski, 1991). It is commonly accepted that C. gud and C. roberti probably appeared and evolved in the Near East or Caucasus (Buzan and Kryštufek, 2008), with subsequent divergence during the Middle Pleistocene, whereas C. nivalis would have evolved from a western mountain reclusion in the Alps, Carpathians or Pyrenees (e.g., Castiglia et al., 2009; Nadachowski, 1991), consis- tent with paleontological data from the Holsteinian (420–375 ka) (Kowalski, 2001). Such a hypothesis, however, did not fit the Middle Pleistocene record of C. nivalis in Emirkaya-2 (Montuire et al., 1994) and on the island of Chios (connected to the mainland at that time; Storch, 1975), in better agreement with the estimated radiation of C. nivalis 0.597 Myr ago (95% HPD: 0.417–0.794). While the eastern origin of C. gud and C. roberti has never been questioned, the western origin of C. nivalis remained uncertain. The inclusion of the eastern C. nivalis subspecies was essential to obtain a complete picture of the phylogeographic origin of C. nivalis. The basal phyloge- netic position of the eastern species C. gud and C. roberti, and of the eastern C. nivalis subspecies unambiguously establishes the Caucasus and Middle East as the region of origin of all Chionomys species, including C. nivalis.
4.3. Intraspecific relationships in C. nivalis
The phylogenetic reconstructions based on mtDNA and Y-chromosome data are congruent and reveal that the easternmost subspecies of Chionomys nivalis (C. n. dementievi) represents the old- est lineage within C. nivalis. This basal position clearly supports an eastern origin of the species. The question of specific or subspecific rank of this taxon is pertinent. The level of divergence between C. n. dementievi and other C. nivalis subspecies (3.78 ± 0.53% for the cyt b; see Supplementary Table S3) lies below the pragmatic >5% limit of interspecific differentiation as suggested by Baker and Bradley (2006); hence, mitochondrial data provide no evidence sup- porting the recognition of C. n. dementievi as a full species. Further- more, crossing experiments between European Snow Voles from the Swiss Alps and Kopet-Dag showed no hampered reproduction (V. Malikov and P. Vogel, unpublished data) and may rather indicate subspecies level. In contrast to conclusions based on morphology

C. n. trialeticus is rather closely linked to the clade from the Near East, namely C. n. hermonis (Israel and Syria) and C. n. cedrorum (Turkey). The remaining haplotypes from Western Europe are closely related to each other. This is consistent with pre- vious phylogeographic conclusions, but better explained by our median-joining network (Fig. 5) than by the minimum spanning network by Castiglia et al. (2009) that did not include the eastern clades (and see also Cassens et al. (2005) or; Woolley et al. (2008), for a discussion on the use of minimum spanning network method for phylogenetic reconstruction). It suggests that during the glacia- tions’ cycles, C. nivalis persisted in several refugia, from which the species recolonized the mountain chains. However, larger sample sizes are needed for a sound reconstruction and corroboration of the phylogenetic relationships between the patchily distributed populations and subspecies of C. nivalis in order to disentangle effects of past isolation during the Last Glacial Maximum from cur- rent discontinuity due to strong geographical barriers on population structure.
4.4. Conclusion
The more comprehensive sampling of Chionomys snow voles, including the most eastern populations of C. nivalis, corroborates Caucasus and Middle East as the phylogeoprahic origin of the spe- cies C. nivalis and the genus Chionomys.
