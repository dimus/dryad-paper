Phylogenetic relationships of 19 species of didelphid marsupials were studied using two nuclear markers, the non-coding transthyretin intron 1 (TTR) and the coding interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein exon 1 (IRBP), and two mitochondrial genes, the protein-coding cytochrome b (cyt-b) and the structural 12S ribosomal DNA (12S rDNA). Evolutionary dynamics of these four markers were compared to each other, revealing the appropriate properties presented by TTR intron 1 together with its well supported and resolved phylogenetic signal. Nuclear markers supported the monophyly of medium and large-sized opossums Metachirus + (Chironectes, Lutreolina, Didelphis, Philander), and the paraphyly of mouse-sized opossums, with the genera Gracilinanus, Thylamys, and Marmosops as a sister group to medium and large-sized didelphids. ConXicting branching patterns between mitochondrial and nuclear data involved the phylogenetic position of Marmosa–Micoureus–Monodelphis relative to other mousesized opossums. Nuclear phylogenetic inferences among genera were conWrmed by the presence of synapomorphic indels observed in TTR intron 1. A Bayesian relaxed molecular clock dating of didelphid evolution using nuclear markers estimated their origin in the Middle Eocene (39.8 million years ago), with subsequent diversiWcation during the Oligocene (Deseadan) and Miocene.

  Abstract
  1. Introduction
The didelphoid marsupials (order Didelphimorphia) are a moderately diverse group of mammals that probably originated in North America during the Middle to Late Cretaceous (Cifelli, 1993; Cifelli and de Muizon, 1997; Clemens, 1966; Marshall, 1982; Springer et al., 1994), and which are supposed to be the sister-group of all other living marsupials (Amrine-Madsen et al., 2003a; Archer, 1976; Springer et al., 1994). The origin of didelphoids in North America has been related with fossil forms such as Kokopellia, Alphadon, and Peradectes

from the middle to late Cretaceous (Cifelli, 1993; Cifelli and de Muizon, 1997; McKenna and Bell, 1997). The radiation of didelphoids in South America has been associated with early Cenozoic fossils of the genera Pucadelphys, Incadelphys, Andinodelphys (Paleocene, Tiupampa-Bolivia), and Didelphopsis, Protodidelphis, and Marmosopsis (Paleocene, Itaboraian-Brazil; Marshall, 1982; Marshall and de Muizon, 1988; Marshall et al., 1995). Those Paleocene genera were originally considered members of Didelphidae family because of their morphological similarities to extant didelphid species. Currently, they are considered basal metatherians based on comparisons to new fossil records and analyses of large morphological data sets (Rougier et al., 1998; Horovitz and Sánchez-Villagra, 2003).

didelphoid genera belong to the Didelphidae family and appear to demonstrate a more recent history than the Paleocene metatherians. The oldest didelphid fossils discovered are attributed to the genera Micoureus and Thylamys, dating from the Middle Miocene (Laventan) in Colombia (Goin, 1997; Marshall, 1984; Reig et al., 1987).
The diversity of living Didelphidae includes 17 genera and more than 70 species (Gardner and Creighton, 1989; Gardner, 1993; Hershkovitz, 1992; Kirsch and Calaby, 1977; Voss and Jansa, 2003) classiWed into two subfamilies. Species belonging to Didelphinae are composed of 14 genera with mouse-sized (Marmosa, Micoureus, Marmosops, Gracilinanus, Monodelphis, Thylamys, Hyladelphys, Tlacuatzin, and Lestodelphys), medium-sized (Metachirus), and large-sized (Chironectes, Didelphis, Philander, and Lutreolina) forms. Most mouseand
Contradicting ideas about didelphid phylogenetic aYnities result from the use of diVerent approaches for the analysis of morphological characters, chromosomes, allozymes, and more recently DNA sequences (for a summary, see Jansa and Voss, 2000). Debates are principally focused around the phylogeny of mouse-sized opossums and the position of Monodelphis and Metachirus within Didelphinae.
Morphological data based on external and cranial characteristics support the monophyly of mouse-sized opossums (Creighton, 1984; Reig et al., 1987; Tate, 1933), whereas molecular data suggest their paraphyly: Thylamys, Lestodelphys, Marmosops, and Gracilinanus are related to large-size didelphines, and are separated from Marmosa and Micoureus (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Kirsch and Palma, 1995; Patton et al., 1996).
According to diVerent morphological studies, Monodelphis is either placed as a sister group of all mousesized opossums (Tate, 1933), or is nested within mousesized opossums as a sister taxon of Lestodelphys and Thylamys (Creighton, 1984; Reig et al., 1987). Molecular analyses placed Monodelphis as a sister-group of either all didelphines (12S rDNA gene: Palma and Spotorno, 1999) or a Marmosa–Micoureus clade (DNA–DNA hybridization: Kirsch, 1977; Kirsch and Palma, 1995; mitochondrial cytochrome b [cyt-b] gene: Patton et al., 1996; nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein [IRBP] Gene: Jansa and Voss, 2000).
Comparative morphology has suggested that the medium-sized Metachirus either groups with the mousesized opossums (Creighton, 1984), or is nested in the
taxon Marmosidae as deWned by Hershkovitz (1992), i.e., a family-ranked taxon composed by all mouse-sized opossums plus the genus Metachirus, or considered as a separate didelphid lineage (Reig et al., 1987). Molecular approaches have clustered this genus either with the large-sized opossums (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Kirsch and Palma, 1995; Patton et al., 1996) or with the mouse-sized opossum Marmosops (Palma and Spotorno, 1999).
Our understanding of didelphid phylogeny improved considerably with recent studies of the IRBP gene (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Voss and Jansa, 2003), even if its phylogenetic performance was limited in certain respects, such as: (a) the dichotomy between Caluromyinae–Didelphidae, (b) the Marmosa–Micoureus clade, and (c) the Didelphis–Philander genera. Moreover, questions relative to the evolutionary origin and molecular dating of didelphid marsupials were not extensively addressed by earlier molecular studies (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Palma and Spotorno, 1999; Voss and Jansa, 2003).
This study aims to test the hypotheses of didelphid phylogeny utilizing a new phylogenetic marker: the non protein-coding transthyretin intron 1 (TTR). This intron from the thyroid hormone-binding protein gene has recently been shown to be an invaluable source of characters for use in phylogenetic studies of various mammalian groups, such as Carnivora (Flynn and Nedbal, 1998), Bathyergidae and Cavioidea rodents (Rowe and Honeycutt, 2002; Walton et al., 2000), and Primates (Yoder and Yang, 2004). Therefore, our goals are to compare the evolutionary dynamics and phylogenetic signal of the nuclear non-coding transthyretin intron 1 sequences with those from three phylogenetic markers with diVerent functions and located in diVerent cell compartments: mitochondrial, with new sequences of the protein-coding cytochrome b and structural 12S ribosomal DNA (12S rDNA) genes, and nuclear, with IRBP coding sequences (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Voss and Jansa, 2003). In addition, the recent developments of Bayesian approaches to relax the molecular clock assumption (Kishino et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 1998) allowed us to estimate divergence times of the major clades of living didelphids, and put them in perspective with major geographic and climatic events of the South American continent.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Taxon sampling and data acquisition
New sequences of mitochondrial genes cyt-b (828 bp) and 12S rDNA (792 bp), and TTR intron 1 (1709 bp) were obtained for 19 marsupial didelphids (Table 1). The Australian marsupial Macropus giganteus (Diprotodontia: Macropodidae) and the South American Caenolestes fuliginosus (Paucituberculata: Caenolestidae) were

(except for
2n D 22) and
karyotype of 2n D 22 (Reig and Bianchi, 1969; Reig et al., 1987; Voss and Jansa, 2003). The subfamily Caluromyinae (2n D 14 chromosomes) includes three large-sized genera (Caluromys, Caluromysiops, and Glironia). However, varying opinions exist with regard to the formal taxonomical arrangement of these groups of genera.

considered as outgroups for rooting the didelphid tree in all phylogenetic analyses, as proposed by other authors (Amrine-Madsen et al., 2003a; Jansa and Voss, 2000; Palma and Spotorno, 1999). Tissue samples were stored in ethanol as part of the mammalian tissue collection of the “Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution de Montpellier, France” (CatzeXis, 1991).
DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved tissues using a phenol–chloroform, proteinase K-RNase method (Sambrook et al., 1989). Mitochondrial and nuclear sequences were ampliWed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using conserved primers: for cyt-b, MVZ05 and MVZ16 (Smith and Patton, 1993); for 12S rDNA, R1, 331, S3, and 330 (Douzery and CatzeXis, 1995); and for TTR intron 1, MP1 and MM2 (Aldred et al., 1997; Duan et al., 1995).
AmpliWcations were performed in a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research). AmpliWcation conditions for cyt-b followed the methods of Steiner and CatzeXis (2003). 12S rDNA ampliWcation conditions consisted of 30 cycles comprising an initial denaturation at 95°C (1 min), followed by annealing at 50 °C (45 s), and extension at 72°C (2min). TTR ampliWcation conditions were modiWed from Duan et al. (1995) and Aldred et al. (1997) having an initial denaturation at 94°C (3min), followed by 30 cycles comprising a denaturation at 94°C (45s), annealing at 54°C (55s), and extension at 68 °C (2 min).
For outgroup taxa, PCR-ampliWed fragments of the entire TTR intron 1 were cloned by ligation into the pGEM-T plasmid (Promega). Competent cells (original TA Cloning kit, Invitrogen) were transformed and incubated overnight. We used pUC/M13 forward and reverse primers to check for the insertion of TTR DNA fragments into the vector. SP6 and T7 primers were used to sequence the cloned TTR intron 1 fragments. A minimum of Wve clones per taxon were sequenced.
Both strands of each mitochondrial and nuclear fragment were sequenced using an automatic sequencer (ABI 310 Perkin–Elmer, Applied Biosystems) with Big Dye Terminator Cycle Polymerase. Sequencing primers for cyt-b (H8 and L13) were deWned in Steiner and CatzeXis (2003). For 12S rDNA sequencing, the ampliWcation primers were used. Internal primers for TTR intron 1 are shown in Fig. 1. The 49 sequences obtained have been deposited into GenBank (Table 1). Sequences obtained by Jansa and Voss (2000) and Voss and Jansa (2003) for IRBP exon 1 (1158bp) were included in the phylogeneticanalyses.
2.2. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Cyt-b, 12S rDNA, and IRBP sequences alignments were performed using the ED editor of the MUST package (Philippe, 1993; see Asupplementary data for alignments). Alignment of 12S rDNA sequences was carried

out using the 12S secondary structure in order to detect conserved (stems) and variable (loops) regions among sequences (Springer and Douzery, 1996). Alignment of TTR sequences was conducted with the T-CoVee program (Notredame et al., 2000) with default parameters settings, and then manually corrected for potential misalignments. The T-CoVee program has been shown to outperform other multiple sequence alignment methods when the level of identity between sequences is low (Notredame et al., 1998). Ambiguous regions of the TTR intron 1 alignment (such as insertion–deletion areas where nucleotide homologies were not clearly determined) were excluded from subsequent phylogenetic analyses. Autapomorphic indels observed in TTR sequences were also excluded from the analyses. All remaining gaps were treated as missing data. An a posteriori analysis was also carried out to evaluate the phylogenetic signal contained in indels.
As proposed by Hassanni et al. (1998), consistency and saturation analyses were performed with PAUP* version 4.0b10 (SwoVord, 2002) considering Consistency index (CI) of each substitution type, and saturation values corresponding to the slope (S) of linear regression of patristic distances against adjusted character distances.
Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by cladistic (maximum parsimony) and probabilistic (maximum likelihood and Bayesian) methods. Maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) trees were obtained with PAUP* version 4.0b10 (SwoVord, 2002) using heuristic searches with 100 random addition sequences of taxa using the tree bisection–reconnection branch swapping option. The best Wtting model of sequence evolution for each data set—cyt-b, 12S rDNA, IRBP, TTR intron 1—was determined using Modeltest 3.06 (Posada and Crandall, 1998). However, to render maximum likelihood analyses comparable under the same molecular evolutionary model, we chose to use the General Time Reversible model (GTR; Yang, 1994) plus a gamma (􏰃; Yang, 1996) distribution with eight catego-
ries for the substitution rate heterogeneity among nucleotide sites (GTR + 􏰃8). This model was identiWed by Modeltest for both mitochondrial genes (cyt-b and 12S rDNA) based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Simpler evolutionary models were identiWed for nuclear partitions, with K81 + 􏰃 for TTR and TVM + 􏰃 + I for IRBP where I represents the fraction of invariable sites. Using the same model for each data set also allowed the evolutionary dynamics of four molecular markers to be adequately compared in terms of substitution pattern and rate of evolution. Support for internal nodes was assessed by bootstrap analyses (Felsenstein, 1985), with 1000 and 200 replicates for MP and ML methods, respectively. Under ML, the previously estimated optimal parameters were used with NJ starting trees and TBR branch swapping.
The Bayesian approach was implemented using MrBayes 3.0b4 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) using default priors, i.e., Dirichlet priors for base frequencies (1,1,1,1) and for GTR parameters (1,1,1,1,1) scaled to the G-T rate, a Uniform (0.05,50.00) prior for the 􏰃 shape, and an Exponential (10.0) prior for branch lengths. All topologies were a priori equally probable. To accommodate for the diVerent patterns of nucleotide substitutions among mitochondrial, nuclear, protein coding, ribosomal, and non-coding sequences, the combined analysis of cyt-b + 12S rDNA + IRBP + TTR-intron 1 was performed with allowance of one independent set of nucleotide frequencies + GTR + 􏰃8 parameters for each marker. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling was performed with four incrementally heated chains that were simultaneously run for 1,000,000 generations, using default priors as starting values for model parameters. Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) were obtained from 50% majority rule consensus of trees sampled every 100 generations after removing half of the trees as the “burn-in” stage. In combined analyses a chimerical sequence was assembled for genus Thylamys, including sequences of T. pusilla for cyt-b, 12S rDNA, and TTR

intron 1 partitions, and a sequence of T. pallidior for IRBP gene.
2.3. Statistical tests
ML base composition stationary assumptions were evaluated for each of the data sets by the 􏰄2 test implemented in PAUP (SwoVord, 2002). Congruence tests of alternative optimal topologies among the four markers were executed using incongruence length diVerence test (ILD; Farris et al., 1995) and crossed Shimodaira and Hasegawa (SH) test (see Delsuc et al., 2002). A posteriori selected topologies (Goldman et al., 2000) were statistically compared to the best ML topology by the test of Kishino and Hasegawa (1989) applying the Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999) correction for multiple comparisons (SH test).
2.4. Molecular dating
The global molecular clock hypothesis was evaluated for all taxa and genes using the likelihood ratio test (LRT; Felsenstein, 1988). Divergence ages of didelphid clades were estimated for nuclear partitions (TTR and IRBP) by the Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach developed by Thorne et al. (1998) and Kishino et al. (2001). Mitochondrial genes were excluded from molecular dating analyses due to their low phylogenetic resolution, higher saturation level, and poor branches support (see Section 3). The Bayesian method relaxes the molecular clock assumption along the branches of the optimal tree, and incorporates the uncertainty of the paleontological record while allowing the deWnition of simultaneous calibration intervals. The dating procedure involved two steps. First, the program ESTBRANCHES (ftp://statgen.ncsu.edu/pub/thorne) estimated branch lengths and the variance–covariance matrix from the data sets, using Caenolestes and Macropus sequences for the outgroup. For nucleotides, a F84 + 􏰃8 model was used, with ML parameters estimated under PAML (Yang, 1997) version 3.1. F84 was the unique available model of nucleotide substitution under ESTBRANCHES. The rate parameter was 1.29 for the nuclear combined data set and 􏰅D2.06 for the shape of the 􏰃 distribution with eight discrete categories. Second, the program DIVTIME version 5b estimated the mean ages of divergence between taxa, with the associated standard-deviation and 95% credibility intervals. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo was sampled 10,000 times with 100 cycles between each sample and burn-in after 100,000 cycles. The following prior Gamma distributions were adopted: a mean 65 million years ago (Mya) for the expected time between tips and root under the absence of constraints on node times (and standard-deviation [SD] D 32.5 Mya), corresponding to the oldest basal Metatheria recorded during the Paleocene in South
America (Marshall, 1982; Marshall and de Muizon, 1988; Marshall et al., 1995), 0.1161 (SD D 0.0581) substitutions per site per million years for the rate at the root node, 0.01 (SD D 0.01) for the parameter that controls the amount of rate autocorrelation per million years. The highest possible number of time units between tips and root was 115 Mya, corresponding to one of the oldest fossil Metatheria (Kokopellia), recorded from the lower Cretaceous in North America (Albian period; Cifelli, 1993; Cifelli and de Muizon, 1997).
Two calibration constraints were imposed: (a) genus Micoureus from Middle Miocene, in Laventan–Friasian South American Land Mammal Age (calibration lower limit D 11.8 Mya and upper limit D 16.3 Mya; Goin, 1997; Marshall, 1976); (b) genus Didelphis from Late Miocene during Montehermosan period (calibration lower limit D 4.0 Mya and upper limit D 6.8 Mya; Simpson, 1972, 1974).

an excess of A + T (more than 58%). In contrast, IRBP was more G + C rich (»56%). Biased base composition of these mitochondrial and nuclear sequences in didelphid marsupials follows the same patterns than those observed in other mammalian groups (Flynn and Nedbal, 1998; Irwin et al., 1991; Janke et al., 1994; Rowe and Honeycutt, 2002; Springer et al., 1995; Walton et al., 2000).
Substitution rate matrices obtained by maximum likelihood analyses demonstrated a strong substitution bias toward T M C transitions (202.30) as compared to G M C and G M T transversions (1.43 and 1.00, respectively) for cyt-b sequences. This bias may be explained by the rich T composition of cyt-b (»31%; Hancock et al., 1988; Sullivan et al., 1995) as well as by the transition/ transversion ratio (TI/TV) parameter which revealed that transition substitutions are much more frequent than transversions (see below). The 12S rDNA gene showed a similar pattern of substitutions rate than cyt-b but less biased towards transitions. No bias in substitution rate was observed for both nuclear partitions even if IRBP seem to harbor more transitions than transversions (AMGD7.57 and TMCD9.33). The TI/TV parameter indicated similar values for cyt-b and TTR partitions (around 1.70) and a slightly smaller value for 12S rDNA gene (1.45). In contrast, IRBP showed more than two times more transitions relative to transversions (TI/TV D 2.20).
Mitochondrial markers and IRBP exon 1 showed 􏰅 parameter values lower than 1 (between 0.41 and 0.76), indicating a strong among-site rate heterogeneity. The 12S rDNA rate heterogeneity (􏰅D0.41), previously observed by Sullivan et al. (1995) on the same molecule, likely reXects its mosaic structure consisting of slower evolving stems and faster evolving loops related with secondary structure base-pairing interactions (Springer et al., 1995; Springer and Douzery, 1996). Protein coding genes (cyt-b and IRBP) also undergo diVerent evolutionary constraints because of codon positions structure, inducing strong rate heterogeneity among sequence sites (Prychitko and Moore, 2000). Another source of rate heterogeneity in cyt-b is associated with the position of the protein throughout the mitochondrial membrane (McClellan and McCracken, 2001), deWning trans-membrane versus extramembrane domains (Irwin et al., 1991). TTR has a low among site substitution rate heterogeneity (􏰅 D 2.48) explained by the evolutionary pattern of introns or noncoding regions, with all sites within sequences more or less equally free to mutate due to the lack of functional and evolutionary constraints (Slade et al., 1994).
Mitochondrial genes showed stronger saturation (S) and homoplasy (CI) values relative to nuclear genes, the cyt-b being more noisy and saturated (S D 0.29; CI D 0.34) than the 12S rDNA gene (S D 0.67; CI D 0.51). Nuclear partitions did not show marked saturation and homoplasy, with S D 0.72 and CI D 0.78 for IRBP, and
S D 0.81 and CI D 0.79 for TTR (Table 2). Similar results have been observed in other mammal groups and birds after comparing substitution rate between nuclear and mitochondrial genes (Hassanin and Douzery, 1999; Prychitko and Moore, 2000; Slade et al., 1994; Springer et al., 2001). Substitution saturation patterns in the TTR intron 1 of didelphids was similar to those observed in carnivorans (Flynn and Nedbal, 1998), in bathyergid and cavioid rodents (Rowe and Honeycutt, 2002; Walton et al., 2000).
The saturation plots (Fig. 2) of the four markers revealed contrasted substitution properties of the mitochondrial and nuclear sequences. Whereas the cytochrome b is evolving very rapidly and with a highly saturated pattern—an increase of 400–900 ML inferred substitutions correspond to ca. 150 observed diVerences—the transthyretin intron 1 is evolving more slowly, and with a very low saturation pattern, even for outgroup-to-ingroup comparisons, therefore putting some conWdence on the rooting of the Didelphinae tree. To a lesser extent, the 12S rDNA is evolving like cyt-b: the mutational dynamics is slower, but a plateau is reached for outgroup-to-ingroup comparisons. IRBP is the slowest evolving of the four markers, and displays a pattern intermediate between TTR and mitochondrial genes.
symbols.
 Fig. 2. Saturation plots of the numbers of observed diVerences as a function of the numbers of maximum likelihood inferred substitutions for each pair of sequences for the two mitochondrial and the two nuclear markers. ML pairwise distances were inferred from branch lengths calculated on the best ML topology found with the concatenation of the four markers (see Fig. 5). The Y D X straight line shows the case where there is no homoplasy in the data. TTR, IRBP, cyt-b, and 12S rDNA comparisons are respectively indicated by squares, triangles, circles, and diamonds. Ingroup (Didelphinae) versus outgroup (Macropus and Caenolestes) comparisons are represented by hatched

Since these four molecular markers belong to diVerent cellular compartments (nuclear and mitochondrial) and are protein coding, ribosomal coding and non-coding, they evolve under markedly diVerent selective pressures (see above). Evolutionary properties evidenced by nuclear genes and mainly by the TTR intron 1 (high percentage of non-saturated variable sites, low among site rate heterogeneity, equilibrated nucleotide frequencies and substitutions rates, weak homoplasy, and saturation), suggest their potential performance relative to mitochondrial genes to resolve phylogenetic relationships within Didelphidae.
3.2. Phylogenetic results
3.2.1. Individual genes
Phylogenetic signal of the four separated markers were compared including all didelphid taxa plus outgroups. Similar topologies were obtained for both nuclear partitions (TTR and IRBP) using diVerent phylogenetic approaches: maximum parsimony (TTR: tree length TL D 2099, CI D 0.79; IRBP: TL D 465, CI D 0.78), maximum likelihood (TTR: ¡ln L D 10409.16; IRBP: ¡ln L D 4172.80), and Bayesian inference (TTR: ¡ln L D 10424.63; IRBP: ¡ln L D 4190.48). Maximum posterior probability phylograms from the Bayesian inference are represented in Fig. 3. Three major clades within Didelphidae were observed from nuclear analyses supporting the monophyly of medium and large-sized opossums Metachirus + (Chironectes, Lutreolina, Didelphis, Philander), as well as the paraphyly of mouse-sized opossums, with the genera Gracilinanus, Thylamys, and Marmosops as a sister group of medium and large-sized didelphids. The genera Monodelphis, Marmosa, and Micoureus are positioned in a basal and separated clade within Didelphinae subfamily. These results conWrm previous studies which demonstrated a robust support for the clade unifying mediumand large-sized opossums with Gracilinanus, Thylamys, and Marmosops mousesized opossums (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Voss and Jansa, 2003).
To simplify terminology applied to genera relationships, the clade formed by Chironectes, Lutreolina, Didelphis, Philander (large-sized opossums), and Metachirus (medium-sized opossum) will be consider as Didelphini sensu lato (s.l.) group, in reference to the tribe level deWned by Gray (1821) for large-sized opossums. Also, the clade containing Marmosops, Gracilinanus, and Thylamys genera will be considered as the Thylamyini s.l., referring to the tribe deWnition of Hershkovitz (1992). The clade composed by Marmosa, Micoureus, and Monodelphis will be called Marmosini s.l., therefore extending the tribe deWnition proposed by Reig et al. (1987) for Marmosa and Micoureus.
The 12S rDNA Bayesian topology (¡ln L D 4609.36) was similar to those obtained from nuclear partitions,
with the presence of three main clades (Fig. 3): Didelphini s.l., Marmosini s.l., and Thylamyini s.l., though with lower BP and PP support for all the nodes. Topological variations relative to the Bayesian tree were observed for 12S rDNA ML (¡ln L D 4592.99) and MP analyses (TL D 799, CI D 0.51). The highest likelihood topology placed Marmosini s.l. as the sister group of Didelphini s.l., and the most parsimonious tree placed Monodelphis as the sister taxon of Thylamys. The latter results were not supported by either bootstrap or PP values (trees not shown).
Phylogenetic reconstructions issued from our didelphid 12S rDNA sequences diVered from previous results obtained by Palma and Spotorno (1999), mainly in the phylogenetic position of genera Monodelphis, Thylamys, and Metachirus. Analyses performed by these authors placed Monodelphis as the sister group of all didelphines, followed by Thylamys, disrupting the monophyly of clades Marmosini s.l. and Thylamyini s.l., respectively. In addition, Palma and Spotorno (1999) positioned Metachirus as the sister taxon of Marmosops rather than as the one of large-sized opossums. These issues regarding the 12S rDNA phylogeny are addressed further in a separate study (Steiner et al., unpublished).
A lack of phylogenetic resolution and important variations among topologies were observed for the cyt-b gene according to diVerent phylogenetic methods employed. Bayesian (¡ln L D 7247.79; Fig. 3) and MP (TL D 1700, CI D 0.34) analyses suggest the monophyly of mouse-sized opossum except Monodelphis, whereas ML analyses (¡ln L D 7242.97) placed Marmosini s.l. as the sister group of Didelphini s.l. Contrasting with the phylogenetic signal of other partitions, the cyt-b gene indicates that Monodelphis is a separate taxon within Didelphinae, and that Marmosops is paraphyletic due to placement of Thylamys and Gracilinanus (Fig. 3). Using a more extensive taxon sampling among didelphids, the present cyt-b topology is compatible with the study of Patton et al. (1996), showing a clade composed by medium and large-sized didelphids (Metachirus–Didelphis–Philander) and a clade containing Marmosa + Micoureus. However, most nodes were not supported by bootstrap values, illustrating the lower performances of the cyt-b for inter-generic comparisons, due to its saturated and homoplasic phylogenetic signal. 12S rDNA gene seems to slightly outperform cyt-b to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within Didelphidae in term of topological resolution and node support, as documented by other authors for other taxonomic groups (Halanych and Robinson, 1999; Lopez et al., 1997; Pesole et al., 1999; Springer et al., 2001). Additional phylogenetic analyses were performed with mitochondrial genes considering the saturation of the three codon positions for cyt-b and the stems and loops for 12S rDNA as suggested by Hassanni et al. (1998). However, weighted parsimonious trees do not display improved resolution and bootstrap support (trees not shown).

   Mitochondrial and nuclear partitions all seem to support the nesting of Micoureus demerarae within Marmosa, rendering the latter genus paraphyletic. M. mexicana is a species with an eastern Mexico distribution (Alonso-Mejia and Medellin, 1992) whose specimen identiWcation was conWrmed by our own morphological examination via external characters and cranial measurements as proposed by Alonso-Mejia and Medellin (1992) and Emmons and Feer (1998). Our results pertaining to the Marmosa paraphyly and the basal position of M. mexicana support those of Kirsch and Palma (1995) and Voss and Jansa (2003), based on DNA–DNA hybridizations and morphological+molecular characters, respectively. The latter authors also conWrmed the Marmosa paraphyly after including additional sequences in their analysis (M. robinsoni and M. rubra). Regarding the taxonomic status of Marmosa and Micoureus genera, it was decided to follow Voss and Jansa (2003) suggestion of preserving the current generic taxonomy of these mouse-sized opossums until future research could be carried out, with a more exhaustive taxonomic sampling, allowing us to understand their optimal taxonomic status.
3.2.2. Nuclear, mitochondrial, and combined data sets
Combining signal and noise from diVerent data sets in phylogenetic analyses has long been a matter of controversy (Huelsenbeck et al., 1996). To assess whether data sets might be combined, we employed two diVerent tests. The ILD test was used under MP, and the crossed SH test was conducted under ML (Table 3). Both approaches showed incongruence between the two nuclear partitions (TTR/IRBP; ILD test P D 0.001) and among the mitochondrial and nuclear genes (cyt-b/12S rDNA/TTR/IRBP; ILD test PD0.001). No incongruence was observed between the mitochondrial partitions (ILD test P D 0.920).
Even if incongruence among data sets was observed, the total evidence approach was adopted (Bull et al., 1993), following Eernisse and Kluge (1993) who proposed that concatenation of heterogeneous partitions might improve the phylogenetic signal and node support by increasing the total number of informative sites. Moreover, our data sets were concatenated because incongruent regions among trees are restricted to nodes involving short internal edges and/or weak bootstrap support.
The Bayesian phylograms obtained from the nuclear and from the mitochondrial partitions showed a similar topology (Fig. 4). Both data demonstrated three major clades: the large + medium-sized opossums, the Marmosini s.l., and Thylamyini s.l. Topological diVerences between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies involved the position of Marmosini s.l., respectively, placed as either the sister group of large and mediumsized opossums or as the basal clade of Didelphinae.

 Fig. 4. Comparison of Bayesian topologies obtained for mitochondrial (1620 bp; ¡ln L D 12008.84) and nuclear (2867 bp; ¡ln L D 14926.49) partitions concatenations. Mitochondrial concatenation analyses by parsimony (TLD2516; CID0.39) and maximum likelihood (¡lnLD11986.08; 􏰅 D 0.44) methods showed similar topologies. Also, the nuclear concatenation analysis (TTR + IRBP) revealed similar topologies according to parsimony (TL D 2584; CI D 0.79) and maximum likelihood (¡ln L D 14910.41; 􏰅 D 1.06) approaches. Maximum parsimony (BPMP) and maximum likelihood (BPML) bootstrap values superior to 50% are indicated for all nodes, as well as posterior probabilities (PP). A star indicates the highest support for all three approaches (BPMP D BPML D 100%; PP D 1.00). Double arrows emphasize topological diVerences.
Relative to mitochondrial DNA, the nuclear concatenation showed stronger nodes support.
DiVerences in phylogenetic resolution obtained from nuclear and mitochondrial partitions are likely to be related to their evolutionary properties in terms of base composition, substitution rate and saturation. It has been documented that marked base composition bias and heterogeneous substitution rates—like in mitochondrial genes—might generate equivocal phylogenies (Galtier and Gouy, 1995; Lockhart et al., 1994; Perna and Kocher, 1995).
Phylogenetic analyses were also carried out for total evidence data set (mitochondrial plus nuclear concatenations). Similar topologies were obtained from parsimony (4487 bp; TL D 5131, CI D 0.59), maximum likelihood (¡ln L D 27782.29) and Bayesian (¡ln L D 27869.43) methods. The Bayesian phylogram obtained from the total evidence data set is presented in Fig. 5. The contribution of nuclear markers in the phylogenetic signal appears preponderant because the four-partition topology is the same as the one inferred from the nuclear concatenation. Bootstrap values were essentially identical, with a slight increase in robustness for more terminal nodes and slight decrease for more internal nodes.
Because the combination of heterogeneous partitions under model-based tree-building methods may have an impact on the best topology inferred—especially in the case where mitochondrial and nuclear data are combined (see Table 1)—a Bayesian analysis was carried out using a separate GTR + 􏰃 model for each of the four partitions. The maximum posterior probability tree was identical to the one of Fig. 5, and the posterior probabilities of nodes were not aVected by more than 0.01. In the present case, the use of a one-partition or a four-partition Bayesian analysis did not alter the phylogenetic results.
The best topology obtained under the combined analysis was also documented using other molecular and DNA–DNA hybridization surveys, supporting paraphyly of mouse-sized opossums (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Kirsch et al., 1993; Kirsch and Palma, 1995; Palma and Spotorno, 1999; Patton et al., 1996; Voss and Jansa, 2003) as well as the basal position of Monodelphis relative to Marmosa and Micoureus (Jansa and Voss, 2000; Kirsch, 1977; Kirsch and Palma, 1995; Patton et al., 1996). The sister-group relationship between Metachirus and the large-sized didelphids was also proposed by Kirsch and Palma (1995) and Patton et al. (1996). The clade containing the large-sized

Bootstrap values superior to 50% (BPMP, BPML) and posterior probabilities (PP) were indicated for all nodes. A star indicates the highest support for all three approaches (BPMP D BPML D 100%; PP D 1.00). Thylamys sequence is chimerical, corresponding to the concatenation of T. pusilla for mitochondrial genes plus TTR intron 1, and T. pallidior for IRBP gene. Thin, dashed, and thick branches connect, respectively, mouse-sized, medium-sized, and large-sized didelphids. The rectangles on the phylogram refer to Fig. 6, which represent TTR synapomorphic indels for three major clades of didelphids: black is for large-sized opossums, hatched for Thylamyini s.l., and dotted for Marmosini s.l.. Didelphid species icons were obtained from Emmons and Feer (1998).
didelphids is congruent with most previous phylogenetic studies, including those based on morphological and serological characters (Creighton, 1984; Horovitz and Sánchez-Villagra, 2003; Kirsch, 1977; Reig et al., 1987; Sánchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002).
3.3. Testing for alternative hypotheses
Other alternative hypotheses of relationships proposed in literature were tested under the combined data set. Hypotheses included the monophyly of mouse-sized opossums (Creighton, 1984; Reig et al., 1987; Tate, 1933), the basal position of Monodelphis relative to other didelphines (Palma and Spotorno, 1999), and the phylogenetic position of Metachirus either as the sister taxon of mousesized opossums (Creighton, 1984; Hershkovitz, 1992), or as a separated lineage within Didelphinae (Reig et al., 1987). All these hypotheses were signiWcantly rejected by the SH test (P 6 0.05), suggesting the presence of a strong phylogenetic signal issued from simultaneous analyses.
3.4. The virtues of the transthyretin intron 1
TTR intron 1 showed a size of approximately 1.7 kb for all didelphid taxa. Sequences of Macropus giganteus
and Caenolestes fuliginosus appeared respectively shorter (1590 bp) and larger (2201 bp, due to two large insertions of 366 and 152 bp).
Three diagnostic indels were observed among didelphid TTR sequences. The Wrst indel was a synapomorphic deletion of 12 bp (position 1798 of sequences alignment) shared by Monodelphis, Marmosa, and Micoureus and thus characterizing the Marmosini s.l. group (Fig. 6). The second indel was a derived insertion of about 32–62bp (position 1708) observed in Marmosops, Gracilinanus, and Thylamys, characterizing the Thylamyini s.l. The third indel was a derived insertion of 5bp (position 1094) observed among the large-sized didelphid clade (Chironectes, Lutreolina, Didelphis, and Philander).
The insertion–deletion pattern in TTR intron 1 within Didelphidae corroborates the phylogenetic results obtained after their exclusion from subsequent MP, ML, and Bayesian analyses. The deletion exhibited by Marmosini s.l. represents a signiWcant molecular signature for a clade which associates didelphids with diVerent ecological adaptations and chromosome numbers. Monodelphis (2nD18) with its small tail and ears is adapted to a diurnal and terrestrial mode of life, whereas other mouse-sized opossums (2n D 14) are more well

adapted to arboreal and nocturnal life (Emmons and Feer, 1998; Guillemin et al., 2001).
Indels might represent an important source of nonhomoplasic phylogenetic information among mammals, as shown by recent studies demonstrating the monophyly of Xenarthra, Afrotheria, Euarchontoglires, and Carnivora +
Pholidota (Amrine-Madsen et al., 2003b; Madsen et al., 2001; Poux et al., 2002; Van Dijk et al., 1999).
3.5. Evolutionary radiation events
The molecular clock hypothesis was rejected for all separated genes (P < 0.001) suggesting that mitochondrial and nuclear evolutionary rates are variable among didelphid lineages. Due to saturation and limited phylogenetic performance observed for cyt-b and 12S rDNA for deeper nodes, we decided to exclude mitochondrial data sets from subsequent molecular dating among didelphids. The nuclear data set was analyzed under a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock model (Kishino et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 1998), with calibration by the fossil record of Micoureus and Didelphis. These analyses allow us to estimate the origin of living didelphids in the Middle Eocene, approximately 39.8 Mya (SD D 6.1; Fig. 7), at the lower limit of the Divisaderan period.
The estimated age for the origin of extant didelphids was deeper than the date proposed by Reig et al. (1987) who placed the split between Caluromys and Didelphis + Philander lineages in the Late Oligocene, about 25 Mya, based on the analysis of the fossil record and cranio-dental characters. Based on the cyt-b gene, Patton et al. (1996) proposed a wide 18–40 Mya interval for the Didelphis–Caluromys split, which partially overlaps with our estimation. However, deeper age estimates have been suggested for the origin of Didelphidae. Springer et al. (1994) estimated that didelphids diverged from other marsupials approximately 62 Mya. Based on 12S rDNA transversions and a 130 Mya calibration point for the Erinaceidae/Metatheria split, Springer (1997) dated the Caluromyinae/Didelphinae split in the Late Cretaceous at 67.8–72.5 Mya. Divergence times of the latter two studies are compatible with those of Marshall (1987)—who compared Itaboraian didelphimorphids to living Marmosini (mouse-sized opossums) and Didelphini (large-sized opossums)—but might be of reduced accuracy because of the use of a calibration based on a stem mammal (presumed to be the oldest member of the Ausktribosphenos group) rather than on a crown fossil. Here we suggest an Eocene—rather than Paleocene—age for the origin of didelphoid belonging to

Didelphidae family (Fig. 7). This result supports previous surveys based on morpho-anatomic comparisons suggesting that fossils from the Early Paleocene of Tiupampan fauna (Pucadelphys, Incadelphys, and Mizquedelphys) and from the Paleocene of Itaboraian (Didelphopsis, Protodidelphis, and Marmosopsis; Marshall, 1982; Marshall and de Muizon, 1988; Marshall et al., 1995) should be considered as basal group of metatherians but not belonging to the radiation of present-day Didelphidae (Argot, 2001, 2002; De Muizon and Cifelli, 2001; Horovitz and Sánchez-Villagra, 2003; Sánchez-Villagra and Wible, 2002).
A Middle Eocene origin of extant didelphids coincides with one of the Wrst unequivocal phases of Andes uplift (Divisaderan–Deseadan time), which precipitated a change from the warm woodland habitats that were predominant in the Early Cenozoic (Paleocene–Eocene) to a regime of colder and drier climates (Flynn and Wyss, 1998; Marshall and Cifelli, 1990; Zachos et al., 2001). Didelphinae originated during the Oligocene
about 29 Mya (SD D 3.8 Mya), i.e., 4 Mya after the Eocene–Oligocene transition. This major Paleogene boundary is associated with a dramatic global cooling and drying, and the isolation of Antarctica from South America and Australia creating a continuous circumAntarctic ocean current (Flynn and Wyss, 1998). Permanent Antarctic ice sheets developed, and the sea level dropped dramatically, resulting in changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation and inducing significant changes in terrestrial habitats (Pascual and Jaureguizar, 1990; Zachos et al., 2001). A global cooling, together with a second phase of Andean uplift (Deseadan–Colhuehuapian time) provoked changes in mammalian faunal composition in South America (Flynn and Wyss, 1998; Marshall and Cifelli, 1990). The latter phenomenon led to the regression of tropical forests and expansion of savannas as illustrated by the acquisition of hypsodont teeth in herbivorous mammals from austral regions and by the rise of Notoungulata (Marshall and Cifelli, 1990; Pascual and Jaureguizar, 1990).

376 C. Steiner et al. / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 35 (2005) 363–379
Monodelphis and Metachirus were the Wrst presentday genera of didelphines to originate, respectively, about 26.1 Mya (SD D 3.3) and 20.2 Mya (SD D 2.7), well before the origin of the other mouse-sized and largesized opossums (Fig. 7). Both genera originated during vegetation and climatic changes, at the transition from Oligocene to Miocene (28–16 Mya; Pascual and Jaureguizar, 1990; Zachos et al., 2001). This might explain their ecological adaptation to a more terrestrial rather than arboreal locomotion.
DiVerent lineages of mouse-sized opossums (Thylamyini s.l.: Gracilinanus, Thylamys, Marmosops, and Marmosini: Micoureus and Marmosa), show a relatively synchronic origin between 13 and 17 Mya at the Laventan–Santacrucian periods of the Miocene (Fig. 7). One of the most important diversiWcation of the Didelphidae, currently represented by more than 50 mousesized opossum species, was initiated during Middle Miocene. This epoch was associated with a warmer climatic phase, and with another major episode of Andes uplift (end of Friasian), characterized by a signiWcant increase in the height of the Andes (Marshall and Cifelli, 1990; Zachos et al., 2001).
Orogenesis of the Andes produced a continental demarcation in two biogeographical provinces, one at the North which was warm and humid, and the other at the South, with cold and dry climatic conditions (Flynn and Wyss, 1998; Vucetich et al., 1999). Relief elevation contributed to the drying of meridional regions by blocking wet-charged PaciWc winds (Pascual and Jaureguizar, 1990), and to fundamental modiWcations in hydrographic system in the central and northern areas of the continent. The Amazon hydrographic system has been originated during this period (Hoorn et al., 1995). Thus, Miocene Amazon forest fragmentation (refuge hypothesis; HaVer, 1969, 1997), the evolution of the hydrographic system, and/or the incursion of epicontinental seaways (Flynn and Wyss, 1998; Pascual and Jaureguizar, 1990) might be considered as historical causes potentially involved in the origin of the diversity of extant mouse-sized opossums.
We estimated a more recent diversiWcation of largesized opossums about 12.5 Mya, during the Late Miocene and Pliocene periods, overlapping partially with one of later phases of Andes orogenesis during the Montehermosan SALMA (Marshall and Cifelli, 1990) and with a gradual cooling and reestablishment of a major ice-sheet on Antarctica (Zachos et al., 2001).
Our results conWrm that, during the Tertiary, habitat changes by climatic alteration and geological history of South America played an important role in the pattern of didelphid diversiWcation, as already suggested for xenarthran mammals (Delsuc et al., 2004). Additional DNA sequences analyzed in a relaxed molecular clock framework with reliable calibration intervals are required to increase the precision of divergence time estimates, and
conWrm the possible impact of paleoclimatic variations and geologic events on the evolution of didelphids.
