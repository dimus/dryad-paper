Abstract.Ð To explore the feasibility of parsimony analysis for large data sets, we conducted heuristic parsimony searches and bootstrap analyses on separate and combined DNA data sets for 190 angiosperms and three outgroups. Separate data sets of 18S rDNA (1,855 bp), rbcL (1,428 bp), and atpB (1,450 bp) sequences were combined into a single matrix 4,733 bp in length. Analyses of the combined data set show great improvements in computer run times compared to those of the separate data sets and of the data sets combined in pairs. Six searches of the 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set were conducted; in all cases TBR branch swapping was completed, generally within a few days. In contrast, TBR branch swapping was not completed for any of the three separate data sets, or for the pairwise combined data sets. These results illustrate that it is possible to conduct a thorough search of tree space with large data sets, given suf® cient signal. In this case, and probably most others, suf® cient signal for a large number of taxa can only be obtained by combining data sets. The combined data sets also have higher internal support for clades than the separate data sets, and more clades receive bootstrap support of $ 50% in the combined analysis than in analyses of the separate data sets. These data suggest that one solution to the computational and analytical dilemmas posed by large data sets is the addition of nucleotides, as well as taxa. [Large data sets, parsimony, phylogeny.]
Phylogenetic relationships in many large groups of organisms remain enigmatic despite intensive study. Elucidating relationships in these groups will ultimately require the compilation and phylogenetic analysis of sequences and/or morphological traits representing hundreds of taxa. The feasibility of phylogenetic analysis of such large data sets has been debated, however (e.g., Patterson et al., 1993; Hillis et al., 1994; Hillis, 1995). For example, Hillis et al. (1994) suggested that in some instances correct phylogeny reconstruction for only four taxa would require over 10,000 bp of DNA sequence. This degree of complexity implied much greater dif® culty with larger data sets and stimulated some to propose that phylogenetic problems be broken into a series of smaller problems (e.g., Mishler, 1994; Kim, 1996; Soltis and Soltis, 1996; Rice et al., 1997), one extreme
being a large number of four-taxon questions (e.g., Graur et al., 1996).
Large data sets also pose problems for parsimony analyses because of the large number of trees that must be examined in searching for the shortest tree(s). The number of potential solutions increases logarithmically as taxa are added (Felsenstein, 1978). For example, for 20 taxa there are approximately 8.87 3 10 23 possible rooted trees (Felsenstein, 1978); for 228 taxa (the number of species recently analyzed by Soltis et al., 1997b, in a phylogenetic analysis of angiosperms using nuclear 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences), there are approximately 1.2 3 10502 solutions (Hillis, 1996).
Despite the dire predictions suggested for some four-taxon analyses (Hillis et al., 1994) and the number of possible trees for large data sets (Felsenstein, 1978), several

 phylogenetic analyses involving hundreds of species have been conducted for angiosperms, and the results of these studies have important implications for the analysis of large data sets. Analyses of three large DNA data sets (each with over 200 species) have been conducted, using the plastid genes rbcL (Chase et al., 1993) and atpB (Savolainen et al., 1996) and the nuclear 18S rDNA (Soltis et al., 1997b). All three analyses have yielded highly similar topologies for the angiosperms (reviewed by Chase and Cox, 1997; Soltis et al., 1997a; Chase and Albert, 1998). A more lengthy analysis of the 499-taxon rbcL data set of Chase et al. (1993) found shorter trees (Rice et al., 1997), but the general picture of angiosperm relationships remains unchanged. Signi® cantly, none of the searches in any of these analyses swapped to completion, despite huge investments of computer time: Soltis et al. (1997b) employed over 2 years of computer time on the 18S rDNA analysis and Rice et al. (1997) devoted a total of ``approximately 11.6 months of CPU time’’ using three Sun workstations in the reanalysis of the rbcL data set. The three gene trees (representing the plastid and nuclear genomes) are highly similar in the relationships they depict for all major groups of angiosperms, suggesting that even these rough estimates of phylogeny based on the individual data sets provide a consistent picture of organismal relationships. Hence, these analyses indicate that the phylogenetic analysis of large data sets may be more tractable than suggested by earlier simulation studies.
Hillis (1996) recently tested the feasibility of analyzing large data sets by simulating the 18S rDNA phylogeny for angiosperms based on 228 sequences (Soltis et al., 1997b). His simulations suggested that the model phylogeny can be reconstructed using either parsimony or neighbor-joining methods with . 99% accuracy with only 5,000 bp of sequence data. Initial empirical work (Soltis et al., 1997a) supported these conclusions. Separate and combined data sets for 232 species of angiosperms for which both rbcL and 18S rDNA sequences were available (over 3,000 bp of sequence
data) were analyzed using parsimony methods. Analysis of the combined data set swapped to completion in a few days; after 1 month, neither of the separate data sets had swapped to completion. In addition, combining the data sets greatly increased the internal support for many clades (as measured by parsimony jackknife values; Farris et al., 1996). Analyses of the rbcL 1 18S rDNA data set generally result in trees having greater overall resolution than those inferred from the separate data sets and a combination of the well-supported clades present in the separate rbcL and 18S rDNA trees. Analysis of the combined data set also recovered several ``uniquely supported’’ clades that received jackknife support of $ 50% in the analyses of the combined, but not the separate, data sets. These results are comparable to those observed with combined data sets in more focused studies involving far fewer taxa (e.g., Olmstead and Sweere, 1994; Soltis et al., 1996; Sullivan, 1996).
To explore further the feasibilty of analysis of large data sets using parsimony, we conducted searches on a combined 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set for 193 species. We also examined the effects of combining large data sets on internal support by conducting bootstrap analyses on the separate and combined data sets. We ® rst constructed separate data sets of 18S rDNA (1,855 bp), rbcL (1,428 bp), and atpB (1,450 bp) sequences for 193 taxa for which all three sequences were available; these three data sets were then combined into a single data matrix 4,733 bp in length. Represented in this matrix are 190 angiosperms from approximately 148 families that represent well the diversity of angiosperms; also included are three outgroups, Ephedra sinica, Ginkgo biloba, and Pseudotsuga menziesii (for atpB, Pinus was used in place of Pseudotsuga). Of the 190 angiosperms included, we used 18S rDNA, rbcL, and atpB sequences for the same genus (and species, if possible) for 137 taxa; in 52 instances, different genera were used as placeholders for a family. In one instance, different families of a sister pair were

 used: Cyperus (Cyperaceae) was used for 18S rDNA and rbcL, whereas Juncus (Juncaceae) was used for atpB. Most of the 18S rDNA and rbcL sequences are from Soltis et al. (1997b) and Chase et al. (1993), respectively; other sources of published sequences include Hoot and Crane (1995), Hoot et al. (1995), and Soltis and Soltis (1997). These were supplemented with additional unpublished sequences.
We conducted parsimony searches on the combined and the three separate data sets using PAUP* 4.0 (Swofford, 1997) and Power Macintosh computers. All parsimony searches were conducted as follows. First, 500 replicate heuristic searches with RANDOM taxon addition and NNI branch swapping were conducted, saving ® ve trees per replicate. Using the shortest trees obtained from these initial searches as starting trees, we then conducted subsequent searches using TBR branch swapping and saving all most parsimonious trees. For the three separate data sets, these subsequent TBR searches were allowed to proceed until the search ``stalled’’ on a tree length for 4 days or more and the number of trees in memory exceeded 3,500. At this point, we selected a new group of ® ve starting trees one step longer than those used initially, and TBR searches were conducted as before. If the initial NNI searches did not produce trees one step longer, we used the next longest trees. This process was repeated three times for each of the three separate data sets. We almost certainly did not ® nd the shortest trees via this approach. The goal of this study was not to ascertain phylogenetic relationships per se, but rather to compare the performance of separate versus combined analyses; thus, trees from the separate parsimony analyses are not presented. However, the shortest trees obtained agree closely with those presented elsewhere (see reviews by Soltis et al., 1997a; Chase and Albert, 1998). For the combined 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set, a similar approach was used: After each TBR search, a new group of ® ve starting trees that were one step longer than those used in the previous search was selected for further anal-
ysis. Where the initial NNI searches did not produce trees one step longer than those just used, then the next longest NNI trees were selected as starting trees. This process was repeated six times for the combined 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set.
Issues of congruence and whether or not multiple data sets should be combined to form a single data set have been the focus of considerable debate (see reviews by Bull et al., 1993; de Queiroz et al., 1995; Huelsenbeck et al., 1996; Johnson and Soltis, 1998). Visual comparison of the rbcL trees of Chase et al. (1993) with the 18S rDNA (Soltis et al., 1997b) and atpB (Savolainen et al., 1996) trees certainly suggests that these three molecular data sets are largely congruent. Using the 193-taxon data matrices assembled here, we assessed congruence using the ``partition homogeneity test’’ command implemented in PAUP* 4.0. Tree lengths obtained from partitioning the data by gene were compared to those obtained from random partitions following Farris et al. (1995). We performed 500 replicate searches using NNI. The partition homogeneity test found the three data sets to be signi® cantly different from random partitions of a single data set (P , 0.05): 18S rDNA 2 atpB, P 5 0.02; 18S rDNA 2 rbcL, P 5 0.02; atpB 2 rbcL, P 5 0.004. Thus, based on these data sets, the greatest amount of incongruence actually involves the two plastid genes, data sets that many would argue could be combined a priori (see later discussion).
Signi® cant incongruence among matrices based on the test of Farris et al. (1995) does not mean incombinability. We have found, for example, that multiple DNA sequence data sets derived from the chloroplast genome are statistically incongruent, although the topologies retrieved from them each are highly similar (Johnson and Soltis, 1998). Nonetheless, because the chloroplast genome is inherited as a unit and is not subject to recombination, plastid data sets (both sequences and restriction sites) are generally considered ``combinable.’’ Furthermore, the sensitivity of this partition homogeneity test has not been

 explored rigorously (e.g., Sullivan, 1996), particularly for large data sets. Perhaps this test is too conservative for large data sets, with a different placement of only one or a few small clades suf® cient to indicate signi® cant incongruence when the overall picture is one of general congruence.
To evaluate the effects of combining large data sets, we compared levels of support for clades in the separate 18S rDNA, rbcL, and atpB data sets with those for the combined 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set, as well as for each combination of two data sets: 18S rDNA 1 rbcL; 18S rDNA 1 atpB ; rbcL 1 atpB. We wanted to determine whether increased resolution and internal support are achieved in analyses of combined rather than separate data sets. To provide an estimate of internal support, we used the ``fast’’ bootstrap option available on PAUP* 4.0 with 1,000 replicates.
All of the clades of three or more species that received bootstrap support of $ 50% are provided in Table 1. The complete bootstrap results for all seven data sets are available at http://www.wsu.edu:8080/ ; soltilab/. More clades having bootstrap values of $ 50% were recovered from the analysis of the rbcL (81) and atpB (88) data sets than for the 18S rDNA data set (48) (Table 1, Fig. 1). This result is not surprising given the slower rate of evolution and lower signal of 18S rDNA compared to rbcL and atpB (Hoot and Crane, 1995; Hoot et al., 1995; Nickrent and Soltis, 1995; Chase and Cox, 1997). Most of the clades having bootstrap values of $ 50% with 18S rDNA are a subset of those observed for rbcL and atpB (this is not to say that 18S rDNA data do not make an important overall contributionÐ see later discussion and Fig. 1). However, three clades receiving bootstrap support are unique to the 18S rDNA data (i.e., Aristolochiaceae; Chloranthus/Saururaceae/Piperaceae; Aristolochia/Asarum/Saruma/Lactoris). The number of clades receiving a bootstrap value of $ 50% in the analyses of the combined data sets increased compared to the separate data sets (Table 1; Fig. 1): 18S rDNA 1 rbcL
± 92; 18S rDNA 1 atpB ± 97; rbcL 1 atpB ± 105; 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB ± 112.
In many instances, clades supported by a bootstrap value of $ 50% in the separate analyses are more strongly supported in the combined analyses. Of the 46 clades receiving bootstrap support of $ 50% in at least one of the three individual data sets, 36 (78%) received increased bootstrap support when all three data sets were combined. The same percentage of two-species clades (not shown) also received increased support when data sets were combined. For approximately 13% of the clades showing an increase in bootstrap support, this increase is small (only 1 or 2%), and for another 9% of the clades, the increase is only 3± 5%, but in most cases (78%), the increase is . 5%. Furthermore, over half of the clades that show an increase in bootstrap support of only 1 or 2% re ̄ ect increases from initial bootstrap values of 98± 99% with the separate data sets to 100% with the combined data sets.
Many clades show a steady increase in bootstrap support when the separate and combined data sets are compared (Table 1). For example, the sister-group relationship of Saururus and Houttuynia with Peperomia and Piper receives bootstrap support . 50% in analyses of all three separate data sets (rbcL 91%; 18S rDNA 87%; atpB 86%); when data sets are combined in groups of two, these values increase to 96± 98%; when all three data sets are combined, the value is 99%. A similar example is provided by the bootstrap values for the apioid clade (rbcL 84%; 18S rDNA 62%; atpB 88%); when data sets are combined in groups of two, the bootstrap values range from 92± 98%; when all three data sets are combined, the value increases to 100% (Table 1). In many instances this increase in bootstrap support in the combined data sets is substantial, elevating a clade from moderate to high support. For example, the caryophyllids s.l. receive bootstrap support of 59% with rbcL and 81% with atpB; although this clade is present in all of the shortest 18S rDNA trees observed, it does not receive bootstrap support $ 50%.

bootstrap values increase greatly, with the highest value (96%) attained with the combination of all three data sets. Similarly, the clade Saxifragaceae s.s. has bootstrap values of 84% and 79% with rbcL and atpB, respectively; with the combination of all three data sets, support increases to 98%.
There are numerous examples in which a clade has bootstrap support of $ 50% with only one of the separate data sets, but when data sets are combined the bootstrap values increase substantially. This pattern is exempli® ed by the ranunculids, a clade observed in all of the shortest trees re-

trieved in all analyses. Of the three separate data sets, the ranunculids clade received bootstrap support $ 50% only with rbcL (51%); however, this value increases to 84% when all three data sets are combined. Similarly, the malpighioid clade has a bootstrap value of $ 50% only with rbcL (53%), but this increases to 86% when all three data sets are combined. Other examples of this same phenomenon include clades labelled asteroids, myrtoids, malvoids, ranunculids-2, ranunculids minus Dicentra, ranunculids-3, glucosinolates, and glucosinolates-1 (Table 1).
Particularly noteworthy are clades that are present in all of the shortest trees but do not receive bootstrap support of $ 50% in analyses of the separate data sets; as data sets are combined, the level of bootstrap support rises. Ericoids are present with bootstrap support of $ 50% in the separate data sets, but as the data sets are combined in pairs, bootstrap support increases to $ 50% in all pairwise combinations (rbcL 1 18S rDNA 58%; rbcL 1 atpB 81%; 18S rDNA 1 atpB 77%); with the combination of all three data sets, bootstrap support reaches 87%. Other examples of small to moderate-sized clades in which this same phenomenon is observed are lamioids-2, saxifragoids, and caryophyllids s.l./Simmondsia. Signi® cantly, a number of large clades do not exhibit bootstrap support of $ 50% until data sets are combined: higher eudicots, eudicots, monocots, Asteridae s.l., and Asteridae s.s. (Table 1). Two clades do not exhibit bootstrap support of $ 50% until all three data sets are combined: Nelumbo/Platanus/Placospermum (52%) and Asteridae s.s. (53%). Thus,

 all of these clades represent what we have referred to previously as uniquely supported clades (Soltis et al., 1997a); only with the combination of data sets is there suf® cient signal to yield bootstrap support of $ 50%.
Combining data sets therefore results in both an increase in bootstrap support for clades (compared to the separate data sets) and the recovery of clades with bootstrap support of $ 50% that did not receive this same level of bootstrap support in the analyses of the separate data sets. These observations apparently re ̄ ect the additive effect of the underlying phylogenetic signal provided by the separate data sets. Thus, although an individual data set may not provide enough signal for bootstrap support of $ 50% for a given clade in the separate analysis, that data set may contribute to an increased level of bootstrap support when data sets are combined. This seems to be particularly true for large clades for which bootstrap values in analyses of the separate data sets are , 50%. Analyses of all three separate data sets reveal (1) a eudicot clade, (2) higher eudicots, (3) Asteridae s.l., and (4) Asteridae s.s., but only with the combination of data sets does suf® cient signal exist to provide a bootstrap value of $ 50% for any of these clades (Table 1). All three data sets contribute to this additive effect, including 18S rDNA, which has the lowest number of bootstrap-supported clades (see also Fig. 1). As an example, the Asteridae s.l. clade ® rst attains bootstrap support $ 50% with the combination of 18S rDNA 1 atpB, but not with 18S rDNA 1 rbcL or rbcL 1 atpB. The 18S rDNA data clearly make a critical contribution to the support for the caryophyllids s.l./Simmondsia and saxifragoid clades as well (Table 1).
Although bootstrap support typically increases as data sets are added (Table 1), this is not always the case. These instances are instructive in that they often pinpoint areas of con ̄ ict among the separate data sets. One example involves the monophyly of Aristolochiaceae. Although 18S rDNA sequence data support this clade with a bootstrap value of 71%, both the shortest
atpB and rbcL trees suggest instead that one member of Aristolochiaceae (Aristolochia) is sister to Lactoridaceae. Similarly, although atpB data indicate a monophyletic betuloid clade (bootstrap value of 92%) comprising ® ve taxa (Alnus, Casuarina, Myrica, Carya, and Fagus), the other data sets are not in complete agreement, due largely to different placements of Myrica in the rbcL trees. This result is noteworthy because, although correctly reported in Chase et al. (1993), the rbcL sequences of Myrica and Celtis were accidentally switched when submitted to GenBank; hence, the present analysis reveals this ``sequencing error.’’ By combining data sets and comparing topologies to those resulting from the analyses of the separate data sets, areas in need of additional investigation (e.g., higher taxon density, resequencing of a taxon, etc.) can be identi® ed.
In addition to producing trees with increased internal resolution and higher internal support, the combined data set also showed great improvements in computer run times (see also Olmstead and Sweere, 1994). With the 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set, TBR branch swapping on the starting trees was generally completed within a few days (Table 2). Subsequent searches (six were conducted) with the 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set continued to swap to completion, even as longer starting trees were employed (Table 2). Two of these six searches each retrieved the shortest trees obtained (18,770 steps); these ``shortest’’ trees were in two different islands (sensu Maddison, 1991). These results indicate that it is possible to conduct a rigorous search of tree space with large data sets, given suf® cient signal and taxa. In this case, and most others, we suspect, suf® cient signal for a large number of taxa can only be obtained by combining data sets. In contrast, swapping was not completed with any of the three separate data sets. After several days to a week, the separate data sets stalled on a tree length, at which point thousands of trees of that length accumulated. Branch swapping was continued for 4 or more days until 3,500 or more trees of this length were in memory;

 a The run times for the rbcL searches are much longer than those for the separate 18S rDNA and atpB searches because the rbcL searches were conducted on a Power Macintosh 6100 rather than on a 7100.
then these searches were terminated. For each data set, the searches typically stalled on trees of the same, or very similar, length, regardless of the length of the starting trees used (Table 2). These results for the separate data sets are not surprising. As noted, our previous analyses of 228 18S rDNA sequences (Soltis et al., 1997b) did not swap to completion despite over 2 years of computer time. Lengthy searches of separate rbcL and atpB data sets of comparable size also have not swapped to completion.
We experimented less extensively with computer run times for the combination of pairs of data sets. Only one set of starting trees was used for the searches conducted with 18S rDNA 1 atpB, 18S rDNA 1 rbcL, and rbcL 1 atpB. Nonetheless, subsequent swapping on starting trees with TBR was not completed in the time frame employed (Table 2). The 190 angiosperms employed in this analysis are a subset both of the 228-taxon 18S rDNA1 rbcL data set analyzed by Soltis et al. (1997a) and of a 270taxon 18S rDNA1 rbcL data set analyzed by Soltis et al. (unpubl.). Although the 190taxon data set did not swap to completion, analyses of both the 228and 270-taxon 18S rDNA 1 rbcL data sets did. Thus, al-
though perhaps counterintuitive, these results illustrate another advantage of combining sequences in studies of this magnitude: The time required for data analysis actually decreases with the addition of more characters and taxa. These empirical data therefore complement the simulations of both Hillis (1996) and Graybeal (1998), which similarly reveal the importance of adding taxa in phylogenetic analyses. The ultimate advantage of decreased run times is the opportunity for more thorough searches of tree space, despite the large numbers of taxa involved and the enormous numbers of possible trees (Felsenstein, 1978).
The explanation for why analyses of the combined data sets swap to completion, whereas the individual data sets do not, may be, in part, the fact that analyses of the combined data sets quickly and consistently ® nd trees very close in length to the shortest trees ultimately obtained (Chase and Cox, 1997; Chase et al., in prep.). Our data lend support to this hypothesis. For example, comparison of the length of the starting trees with the shortest trees obtained for the individual data sets (Table 2) reveals an average difference of 41, 23, and 16 steps for 18S rDNA, rbcL, and atpB, re-

 spectively. When all three data sets are combined, the starting trees obtained are very close in length to the shortest trees ultimately obtained, with an average difference of only 13 steps (Table 2). This disparity may be larger given that the individual searches probably did not ® nd the true shortest trees (as they did not swap to completion), whereas the analyses of the combined 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set always swapped to completion. In addition, the average value of 13 steps for the 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set is in ̄ ated because we experimented more extensively with the use of longer and longer starting trees with this combined data set; the smallest difference between lengths of starting and shortest trees was only 9 steps (with 18S rDNA1 rbcL 1 atpB 2 2; Table 2). Most importantly, when the difference between the lengths of the starting and shortest trees is viewed as a proportion of the length of the shortest trees, the value for the combined analysis (13/18,770 5 0.00069) is much less than those for any of the separate analyses (41/3,134 5 0.013 for 18S rDNA, 23/7,525 5 0.0031 for rbcL, and 16/7,727 5 0.0021 for atpB), demonstrating that the combined analysis much more easily ® nds trees close to the shortest trees ultimately found.
These empirical results for large data sets support the contention of Hillis (1996) that adding a large number of taxa and increasing the number of base pairs in phylogenetic analyses may not only increase the accuracy of the estimated trees, but also reduce the computational dif® culty of the inference process. In his simulation studies (based on the estim ated phylogeny of 228 angiosperms inferred from 18S rDNA sequences provided by Soltis et al., 1997b), Hillis (1996) attributed the unexpected ease of phylogeny reconstruction for this large data set to the fact that homoplasy was likely dispersed across the many branches of the tree, allowing the phylogenetic signal to be detected. The results of the empirical approach presented here for three combined data sets representing 193 taxa and nearly 5,000 nucleotides lend support to this contention. Com-
bining rbcL, atpB, and 18S rDNA data sets for a similar suite of 193 taxa increases the internal support (as measured by the ``fast’’ bootstrap option on PAUP* 4.0) for many clades, often dramatically. Analyses of combined data sets generally reveal complementarity; that is, the well-supported clades present in the separate rbcL, atpB, and 18S rDNA trees are all present. Parsimony analyses of large, combined data sets also reveal clades with bootstrap support of . 50% that did not receive this same level of bootstrap support in the analyses of the separate data sets. Analyses of combined data matrices also reveal greater overall resolution of relationships and a much higher number of clades with bootstrap support . 50% than do analyses of any of the three separate data sets. Patterns of complementarity and increased support for clades observed here with the combined 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set, as well as for each pair of data sets, are similar to those observed in analyses of combined rbcL and 18S rDNA data sets for 232 taxa (Soltis et al., 1997a) and also in more focused studies (e.g., Olmstead and Sweere, 1994; Hoot and Crane, 1995; Hoot et al., 1995, in press; Johnson and Soltis, 1995; Soltis et al., 1996; Sullivan, 1996). Furthermore, combined data sets show an enormous improvement in computer run times. Thus, for these reasons, large data sets may be more tractable than previously considered (e.g., Hillis, 1995; Patterson et al., 1993). We conclude, in support of the simulation studies of Hillis (1996) and Graybeal (1998), that one solution to the computational/analytical dilemmas posed by large data sets is the addition of nucleotides, as well as taxa. The exploratory analyses of a combined 18S rDNA 1 rbcL 1 atpB data set indicate that a well-resolved, strongly supported phylogenetic tree for a data set of 400± 500 angiosperms not only is possible, but may be achieved within the next 2 years.
