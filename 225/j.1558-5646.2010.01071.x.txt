Mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data should recover historical demographic events at different temporal scales due to differences in their effective population sizes and substitution rates. This expectation was tested for two closely related coral reef fish, the tube blennies Acanthemblemaria aspera and A. spinosa. These two have similar life histories and dispersal potentials, and co-occur throughout the Caribbean. Sequence data for one mitochondrial and two nuclear markers were collected for 168 individuals across the species’ Caribbean ranges. Although both species shared a similar pattern of genetic subdivision, A. spinosa had 20–25 times greater nucleotide sequence divergence among populations than A. aspera at all three markers. Substitution rates estimated using a relaxed clock approach revealed that mitochondrial COI is evolving at 11.2% pairwise sequence divergence per million years. This rapid mitochondrial rate had obscured the signal of old population expansions for both species, which were only recovered using the more slowly evolving nuclear markers. However, the rapid COI rate allowed the recovery of a recent expansion in A. aspera corresponding to a period of increased habitat availability. Only by combining both nuclear and mitochondrial data were we able to recover the complex demographic history of these fish.

The broad aim of comparative phylogeography is to infer how co-distributed taxa respond to shared evolutionary events (Avise 2000; Hickerson et al. 2009). Each species is treated as a replicate sample of the underlying processes responsible for observed genetic patterns. Several well-documented geological processes have produced concordant patterns of genetic structure and historical demography, including Pleistocene glaciation in Europe (Taberlet et al. 1998; Hewitt 2000) and northwestern North America (Brunsfeld et al. 2001; Carstens et al. 2005), the closure of the Central American seaway (Knowlton et al. 1993; Hickerson et al. 2006; Lessios 2008), and the rise of the Andes (Burney and Brumfield 2009). However, congruent population genetic patterns
may arise due to different processes occurring at different times (i.e., pseudocongruence; Cunningham and Collins 1994) and similar patterns of subdivision may not accurately reflect a shared history of co-occurring taxa.
Just as multiple co-occurring species may afford replication for inferring common historical events acting in a region, multiple genetic markers allow replicate samples of the demographic history of particular species (Brito and Edwards 2009). By combining markers, researchers make the tacit assumption that those markers are behaving in a similar fashion. However, loci, like taxa, may conflict. A major source of this conflict is the inherent stochasticity in the time of lineage sorting for each marker (Hudson and

         Turelli 2003). Different estimates of demographic history can also result when markers differ from one another in the mechanisms affecting their evolution, such as mode of transmission, effective population size, or rates of recombination (Graur and Li 2000; Hare 2001; Zhang and Hewitt 2003; Brito and Edwards 2009).
The most common example of this in animal studies is the difference between nuclear and mitochondrial sequence markers. The former is transmitted biparentally and interlocus recombination should mean that most nuclear markers provide replicate estimates of a common demography, whereas the latter is transmitted maternally as a single nonrecombining block. Given the power afforded by the small effective population size of mitochondrial DNA (Moore 1995) and the expense and effort required to survey multiple nuclear markers, the argument has been made that mitochondrial DNA offers more than enough power to address most questions (Barrowclough and Zink 2009). However, as cost concerns recede with the advent of next-generation sequencing (Hudson 2008), concerns about factors that could confound inferences provided by mitochondrial DNA (e.g., nonneutrality, extreme rate variation, recombination) have led some (Galtier et al. 2009) to suggest that mitochondrial DNA “is the worst marker” for population genetics and should not be used at all.
In theory, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA should be able to complement each other in demographic studies. The smaller effective population size of mitochondrial DNA should allow it to capture the signal of demographic events that cannot leave their footprints on the larger effective population size of nuclear markers. The strength of nuclear DNA lies in its ability to provide replicate samples of the underlying demographic history affecting the genome of an organism as well as replicate samples of the coalescent process. For this reason, sampling multiple nuclear markers can substantially reduce the variance of parameter estimates (Felsenstein 2006; Carling and Brumfield 2007; Lee and Edwards 2008; Brito and Edwards 2009; Hey 2010). Discussions of the relative merits of mitochondrial and nuclear markers in phylogeography have centered on two different, but complementary, goals: to identify clades of populations (and thus phylogeographic breaks or cryptic species) using gene trees, and to reconstruct historical demography (Zink and Barrowclough 2008; Barrowclough and Zink 2009; Edwards and Bensch 2009). Although mitochondrial DNA is useful in delimiting geographically restricted clades, its power to estimate demographic parameters on its own is poor. The opposite is true of nuclear DNA. Combining both marker types allows investigators to identify clades and then estimate parameters of interest, such as migration rates (Lee and Edwards 2008; Barrowclough and Zink 2009). However, simple combination does not admit the possibility that mitochondrial and nuclear DNA can reveal different demographic events. In practice, such a dual gene class approach to inferring historical
demography requires robust substitution rate estimates for both types of markers to reconcile them into a single time frame. Incorrect estimates of substitution rates can severely bias parameter estimates such as divergence times, population size changes, and migration, among others. Here, we explore congruence of marker types, phylogeographic patterns, and demographic inferences between co-occurring taxa from a genus of reef fish that contains sister taxa to either side of the Isthmus of Panama, allowing the calibration of taxon-specific substitution rates.
Acanthemblemaria is a genus of blennies occurring on both sides of the Isthmus of Panama and throughout tropical and subtropical waters of the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific. They are members of the Family Chaenopsidae, one of only two coral reef fish families with an exclusively Neotropical distribution (Stephens 1963). The Western Atlantic members of the genus occur throughout the Caribbean basin, the Bahamas, and peninsular Florida (Smith-Vaniz and Palacio 1974). All members in the genus are small (∼1.2–3.5 cm SL) and are obligate dwellers of vacated invertebrate holes on shallow (<1 – ∼22 m) rocky and coral reefs (Bo ̈hlke and Chaplin 1993; Clarke 1994).
Acanthemblemaria aspera and A. spinosa are found throughout the Caribbean and the Bahamas and co-occur over large portions of their respective ranges (Fig. 1). The two species are closely related (Hastings 1990 and Eytan et al., unpubl. data), share the same mating system (male resource defense polygyny; Hastings 2002), pelagic larval duration (21–24 days; Johnson and Brothers 1989), and ecologically overlap (Clarke 1994). The two species differ in microhabitat use, though. Acanthemblemaria spinosa lives in shelters in live and standing dead coral off the reef surface (high-profile habitat). Acanthemblemaria aspera is found at the base of standing dead corals or in coral rubble (low-profile habitat), sometimes at the base of corals housing A. spinosa (Clarke 1994).
The differences in microhabitat use and specialization give the two species different propensities to go locally extinct. Clarke (1996) found that A. spinosa populations in St. Croix went locally extinct due to habitat degradation, specifically the destruction of standing dead Acropora palmata corals. The resulting coral rubble, however, allowed A. aspera populations to increase in size. This type of population dynamic may lead to discordant demographic cycles, both between species and between populations. We hypothesize that if the two species do differ in historical demography, despite similar life histories, the contrast in microhabitat requirements for the two blenny species should favor population persistence in A. aspera rather than A. spinosa, as the latter is more prone to local extinction. However, it is not clear whether the population dynamics observed at ecological time scales will extend to evolutionary ones.
We collected mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data for both species from populations where they co-occur and analyzed

the data with substitution rates calculated using a relaxed molecular clock. We then tested the expectation of phylogeographic and demographic concordance among co-distributed taxa. Acanthemblemaria aspera and A. spinosa are good candidates for this test because of their similar life histories, close relationship, and nearly identical geographic distributions, but potential differences in historical demography due to different microhabitat use.
Materials and Methods
SAMPLE COLLECTION
Only individuals from populations in which both species co-occur were used in the current study (Fig. 1 and Supporting Information). Samples from species used as outgroups for analysis of substitution rates were collected from Panama and Belize (Supporting Information). Samples were collected on SCUBA. A dilute solution of quinaldine sulfate was squirted into the blenny hole. A small glass vial was then placed over the hole, into which the fish immediately swam. Photo vouchers from freshly collected specimens are available from RIE for a subset of these individuals by request. Whole fish were stored individually in 95% ethanol at −80◦ C.
DNA EXTRACTION, PCR, AND SEQUENCING
DNA was extracted from 11–16 individuals of each species from each of six populations using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) QIAMP DNA Minikit. DNA was extracted from a total of 84 individuals
from each species, as well as a single individual of A. paula, A. betinensis, and A. exilispinus.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on a PTC-100 or 200 (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) to amplify three genetic markers: protein-coding genes mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and nuclear recombination-activating gene 1 (rag1), and intron V from nuclear alpha-tropomyosin (atrop). The primers used, primer references, and PCR conditions can be found in the Supporting Information. Amplicons were purified with a Strataprep PCR Purification Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or directly sequenced without cleanup in both directions on an ABI 3100 or 3130 XL automated sequencer using 1/8 reactions of BigDye Terminators (Version 3.1, Applied Biosystems) and the amplification primers.
ALIGNMENT AND PHASING
Sequencing reactions for rag1 and COI produced clear reads 539 and 704 bp long, respectively. Reads for atrop were 440 bp, 427 bp, 423 bp, and 418 bp long in A. spinosa, A. paula, A. betinensis, and A. exilispinus, respectively. The atrop sequences for A. aspera had length variants (425, 427, and 429 bp) as well as indel-hets, with the latter obscuring reads. Indel heterozygotes containing a single indel were resolved using CHAMPURU (Flot 2007). Sequences containing more than one indel-het were cloned to resolve constituent allelic sequences using the Invitrogen TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing. The initial direct sequences were always used in determining allelic sequences from cloned DNA

         to avoid scoring any changes that resulted from errors introduced by the PCR.
The COI and rag1 sequences contained no gaps and were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar 2004), implemented in Geneious version 4.5.4 (Drummond et al. 2009), as were the intraspecific atrop datasets. The interspecific atrop alignment, consisting of one sequence each from A. spinosa, A. paula, A. betinensis, A. exilispinus, and A. aspera, was more difficult to align due to length polymorphisms. BAli-Phy version 2.0.1 (Suchard and Redelings 2006) was used to align the atrop sequences using the HKY substitution model, gamma-distributed rate variation, and the default indel model. BAli-Phy was run four times to ensure concordance among runs. The final output from each run was separately analyzed, with all the samples before convergence were discarded as burnin. The consensus alignment from the run with the highest posterior probability was used for the subsequent analyses.
Alleles from sequences with multiple heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were resolved using PHASE version 2.1.1 (Stephens et al. 2001; Stephens and Donnelly 2003; Stephens and Scheet 2005). Input files were prepared for PHASE using the online software package SeqPHASE (Flot 2010). Alleles determined by cloning heterozygotes or as output from CHAMPURU were used to create a “known” file for PHASE. A default probability threshold of 0.9 was used for all runs.
After initial PHASE runs, all datasets contained some individuals with unresolved SNPs. We cloned a subset of these individuals to directly determine their haplotype phase. The direct haplotype observations were then added to the “known” file and the datasets were reanalyzed. Final datasets for each gene and species contained no more than three individuals for which the phase of a single SNP was not resolved to 0.9 (six total for rag1, four for atrop). After alignment and phasing of heterozygous SNPs, the final dataset contained 336 nuclear and 84 mitochondrial alleles for each species. The sequences have been submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers HM196865-HM197713.
HAPLOTYPE NETWORKS
Parsimony networks were constructed for COI for both species using TCS version 1.21 (Clement et al. 2000). Networks for the COI gene in A. spinosa failed to connect at the 95% confidence level so the connection limit was fixed at 70 to connect populations. Although this reduces the confidence of the resulting networks, the main purpose is to visualize the number of inferred mutations between populations, rather than infer relationships among populations.
RECOMBINATION
We tested for recombination using the tree-based SBP and GARD methods of Kosakovsky-Pond et al. (Pond et al. 2006) implemented online via the Datamonkey webserver (Pond and Frost
2005) using the model of sequence evolution chosen by Datamonkey using the AIC criterion, with gamma-distributed rate variation.
The GARD and SBP tests failed to find recombination in any of the pooled population datasets for any of the markers of either species. Recombination was detected via GARD and SBP for one population level dataset—the rag1 alignment for Belize and Honduras in A. spinosa. Recombination was detected with a P value of 0.1 at position 192. We performed all analyses involving the Belize and Honduras rag1 alignment twice, both for the whole alignment and for positions 1–192. The results of those analyses did not differ from those using the full alignment (not shown).
POPULATION STRUCTURE
Sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox, (Villesen 2007) and treated as alleles based solely on identity, not the genetic distance between the haplotypes. Measures of genetic subdivision, as measured by pairwise 􏵖ST values among populations, were calculated using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Excoffier et al. 1992; Michalakis and Excoffier 1996), implemented in GenoDive version 2.0b15.1 (Meirmans and Van Tienderen 2004), which for this purpose are equivalent to Weir and Cockerham’s θ (Weir and Cockerham 1984). To allow meaningful comparisons between species and markers and to correct for high levels of variation within populations, which necessarily reduce measures of the proportion of variation partitioned among populations (Hedrick 2005), the 􏵖ST measures were estimated using a standardizing procedure (Meirmans 2006) implemented by GenoDive. The significance of all comparisons was tested by permutation.
To detect differentiated populations (k) without the need to define populations a priori, and to determine if A. aspera and A. spinosa have congruent patterns of genetic differentiation, a Bayesian clustering analysis was implemented in STRUCTURE version 2.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000) using the admixture model with uncorrelated allele frequencies. A recent extension to the STRUCTURE method (Hubisz et al. 2009), which uses sampling locality as a prior, was employed. The use of this prior does not tend to find population structure when none is present (Hubisz et al. 2009), but has been recommended for situations (like ours) where available data are limited (Pritchard et al. 2009).
We performed 10 replicate runs for k values between 1 (no population differentiation) and 6 (the maximum number of populations sampled). Each replicate was run for 10 million iterations following an initial burnin of 100,000 iterations. Best estimates of k were inferred using the method of Evanno et al. (2005) as implemented in STRUCTURE Harvester (Earl 2009). The output files for the best estimate of k were then processed in CLUMMP (Jakobsson and Rosenberg 2007) using the default parameters.

The Evanno et al. (2005) analysis identified two clusters for both species, but the initial bar plots from these runs showed four clusters (not shown). The Evanno et al. method for determining k is biased toward detecting the highest level of population structure in datasets with hierarchical population structure (Waples and Gaggiotti 2006). This appeared to be the case here, as the initial k = 2 corresponds to a split between populations in the eastern and western Caribbean (data not shown). STRUCTURE was run again to determine if additional structure was present in the two identified clusters. The dataset for each species was split to represent membership in the two detected clusters and each was analyzed with the original run conditions, with the exception that log Pr(X | K) was estimated for k = 1–3.
PAIRWISE SEQUENCE DIVERGENCE
The net average pairwise sequence divergence between each pair of populations for each species and each gene was calculated in MEGA version 4.0 (Tamura et al. 2007) using the model of sequence evolution selected by the AIC in jModelTest (Posada 2008). The models selected by the AIC for each marker and analysis can be found in the Supporting Information. If the chosen model was not available in MEGA, the next less-complex model was used. To aid in direct comparisons, all models of sequence evolution for each marker were the same for both species, using the less-complex model of sequence evolution when these differed.
GENE TREE CONSTRUCTION
Gene trees for each species for each of the three markers were constructed in BEAST version 1.4.8 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007) using a constant size coalescent prior and a strict molecular clock. These were constructed for use in the generalized mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) analysis (see below), which requires rooted ultrametric gene trees. The BEAST analyses do not require the inclusion of an outgroup to root the tree because a molecular clock is enforced (Huelsenbeck et al. 2002; Drummond and Rambaut 2007).
MCMC analyses were run four times for either 10,000,000 steps (COI data) or 25,000,000 steps (nuclear markers), sampling every 1000 steps for all for a total of 10,000 and 25,000 trees, respectively. Convergence onto the posterior distribution was assessed using two methods. The first was by visual inspection of traces in Tracer version 1.4.1 to check for concordance between runs. All parameters had effective sample size (ESS) values > 250. The second method for assessing convergence was by using AWTY (Nylander et al. 2008). Cumulative posterior probability plots were inferred using the “cumulative” function. Posterior probability estimates for each clade were compared between the four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs by producing scatter plots using the “compare” function. One-fourth of the sampled trees were discarded as burnin for each test. The cumulative poste-
rior probability plots indicated that all runs had stabilized whereas the scatter plots showed that posterior probability for clades were similar for all compared runs. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was calculated for each gene tree using TreeAnnotator version 1.4.8 with a burnin of 6250 for the two nuclear markers and 2500 for COI .
SUBSTITUTION RATE AND DIVERGENCE
TIME ESTIMATES
We estimated substitution rates and divergence times using a relaxed clock approach that allows rates to vary among species and divergence times to follow a probabilistic distribution rather than relying on point estimates. The use of a relaxed molecular clock is not appropriate for the analysis of intraspecific data, as the coalescent employs a strict clock (Hein et al. 2005). Any differences in branch lengths in a coalescent tree would only be caused by the variance of the Poisson process describing the number of mutations along a branch and not variation in substitution rates among lineages (Hein et al. 2005). Once all gene copies have coalesced, this restriction is relaxed and rates can vary among lineages.
We determined whether all gene copies had coalesced in individual populations by using the GMYC model (Pons et al. 2006). The GMYC analysis divides a single locus gene tree into a portion in which a Yule speciation process affects the branch lengths and a portion in which there is a shift to a coalescent branching process, using this boundary to define species. Here, it was used to detect the presence of a transition point from a coalescent to Yule process to determine the appropriate use of a relaxed molecular clock. If gene copies were found to belong to distinct clusters then representative alleles from each cluster was used, whereas if no clustering was found then a single representative allele for each species was used. The MCC trees inferred in BEAST were used for the GMYC model, which was implemented in R (R Development Core Team 2009) using the SPLITS package (available at CRAN repository) and the single threshold model.
The substitution rates for the three genes were determined using a relaxed clock analysis in BEAST version 1.48. Based on the results of the GMYC analysis, a tree was built including a single representative nuclear gene sequence for A. aspera, A. spinosa, A. paula, A. betinensis, and A. exilispinus (except for COI, which had five A. spinosa sequences representing populations delimited by SPLITS as having coalesced). Acanthemblemaria paula was included because it is hypothesized to be sister to A. aspera (Hastings 1990 and Eytan et al., unpubl. data) and could break a possible long branch leading to A. aspera. An exponential prior was placed on the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the transisthmian geminate pair of A. betinensis and A. exilispinus. A mean of 7 million years (my) with a zero offset of 3.1 my was used for the exponential prior, which translates into a distribution with lower and upper 95% confidence intervals of
 3384 EVOLUTION DECEMBER2010

         3.28 and 28.92 my, respectively. This prior distribution represents the latest possible divergence between the pair but also allows for the possibility that divergence may have occurred before the final closure of the isthmus, although with a decreasing probability further back in time. The uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (Drummond et al. 2006) was used to estimate branch rates. The nucleotide substitution model GTR + 􏵏 was used for COI and HKY for the two nuclear markers.
Each dataset was also run using the Kimura 2 parameter (K2P) model so that rate estimates would be directly comparable to those for other transisthmian species pairs in Lessios (2008). Further analyses were also done using both the GTR + 􏵏 or HKY model and the K2P model under fixed substitution rates to determine what inferred transisthmian divergence times would be assuming previously published rates of molecular evolution in geminate coral reef fishes. These rates were taken from Table 3 in Lessios (2008) for species pairs assumed to have begun divergence at the final closure of the isthmus. Upper and lower values, where present, were used. The two rates used for COI were 1.03% per million years and 1.77% per million years. The rate used for rag1 was 0.097% per million years. No atrop data were included in Lessios (2008).
Two MCMC searches were conducted for each dataset with a Yule speciation prior on the gene tree for 10,000,000 (COI) or 25,000,0000 (nuclear genes) generations. The log files from the runs were inspected using TRACER version 1.4.1 to check for convergence in the Markov chain. MCC trees were constructed using TreeAnnotator version 1.4.8. The mean rate for each marker and inferred transisthmian divergence time and their 95% upper and lower highest posterior densities, as provided in TRACER, was recorded.
DEMOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION
To detect departures from a constant population size or neutrality, we used the summary statistics Fs (Fu 1997) and R2 (RamosOnsins and Rozas 2002), which have the greatest power to reveal population growth (Ramos-Onsins and Rozas 2002). Large negative values of Fs and small positive values of R2 indicate population growth. We also used Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989), as it also has good power to detect population growth (Ramos-Onsins and Rozas 2002) but has the added benefit of being a two-tailed test. Significantly negative values of Tajima’s D indicate population growth (or a selective sweep), whereas significantly positive values are a signature of genetic subdivision, population contraction, or diversifying selection. The Fs , R2 , and Tajima’s D tests were all implemented in DNAsp version 5.1 (Librado and Rozas 2009) for each gene, population, and all populations combined for each of the two species. The significance of all the tests were determined by 1000 coalescent simulations, also implemented in DNAsp.
We reconstructed the historical demography of each species by using the GMRF skyride plot (Minin et al. 2008), implemented in BEAST version 1.5.2. The GMRF skyride plot is a nonparametric analysis that uses the waiting time between coalescent events in a gene tree to estimate changes in effective population size over time. It differs from the related Bayesian skyline plot (Drummond et al. 2005) by not requiring the specification of a user-defined prior on the number of population size changes in the history of the sample.
GMRF skyride plots using time-aware smoothing were constructed for each population as demarcated by the STRUCTURE analyses, each gene, and all populations combined, for both species. Rates of molecular evolution for each gene were fixed at the values obtained in the substitution rate estimation analysis. Each dataset was run twice for 10 million generations, sampling every 1000, except for the all populations combined datasets, which were run for 100 million generations, sampling every 10,000. Output files were checked in Tracer and all ESS values were greater than 250. Bayesian skyride plots were then visualized in Tracer. Population size changes were deemed significant if the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals at the root of the plot did not overlap with those at the tips.
Results
SIMILAR PATTERNS OF POPULATION SUBDIVISION FOR A. ASPERA AND A. SPINOSA
Acanthemblemaria aspera and A. spinosa had largely congruent patterns of population subdivision. Pairwise 􏵖ST values showed that both species share few, if any, COI alleles among populations, with most populations composed entirely of private alleles (except for Belize–Honduras and Puerto Rico–St. Thomas for A. aspera and St. Thomas–Puerto Rico for A. spinosa) (Table 1). All pairwise COI values were significant, except in the case of Puerto Rico–St. Thomas for A. aspera.
Although most A. spinosa populations did not share any nuclear alleles, all A. aspera populations did. The majority of pairwise comparisons for A. spinosa (9 out of 15) had a corrected 􏵖ST of 1, but none did for A. aspera. The significance of pairwise 􏵖ST values also differed between marker type and between species. Whereas all but one pairwise COI comparison was significant for A. aspera, four of 15 comparisons using nuclear markers were not significant at P = 0.05. This was in contrast to A. spinosa, where all nuclear 􏵖ST values were significant save one, Belize– Honduras, which also lacked significance in A. aspera.
The STRUCTURE analyses (Fig. 2) confirmed the presence of hierarchical population structure and recovered the same four clusters for both species, corresponding to the Bahamas, Belize and Honduras, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas, and St. Maarten. For

However, in the case of A. aspera, there was multimodality in the assignment of individuals from St. Maarten to clusters (see Fig. 2, where there is a probability of 0.6 and 0.4 for assignment of St. Maarten individuals to either the Puerto Rico–St. Thomas cluster or to a separate St. Maarten cluster, respectively). This suggested that k may equal 3 for A. aspera. However, in addition to the results from the Evanno et al. test, the values of L(K) for the eastern Caribbean A. aspera dataset were at their lowest at k = 1 and highest at k = 2 (Fig. S1).
The COI haplotype networks also showed that geographic structuring of populations is largely congruent between the two species (Fig. 3). For both species, most populations were reciprocally monophyletic, with the exception of Belize and Honduras. There, A. spinosa did not share alleles among populations, but A. aspera does.
LARGE DIFFERENCES IN POPULATION GENETIC DIVERGENCE BETWEEN SPECIES
Although overall measures of genetic subdivision were similar for the two species, the degree of genetic divergence among populations was not: A. spinosa had many more inferred mutations between populations than A. aspera (Table 2, Fig. 3). For the two A. aspera populations that had the largest COI genetic distances
between them, Honduras and Puerto Rico/St. Thomas, pairwise sequence differences based on the number of inferred mutations in the haplotype network were 10 times greater for A. spinosa COI than for A. aspera (Fig. 3). The true ratio may be even greater than this conservative estimate, because the number of mutations inferred for A. spinosa using the TCS analysis did not account for the possibility of multiple mutations at the same site. Modelcorrected estimates of net average pairwise sequence divergence between pairs of populations (Table 2) were significantly higher in A. spinosa than A. aspera for all markers (Mann–Whitney Utest P ≤ 0.05 for each) (Table 2). The ratio of mean pairwise genetic distance in A. spinosa compared to A. aspera varied from 19.76 for rag1 to 25.02 for atrop, with COI at 22.57.
GENE TREES AND BRANCHING PROCESSES ARE DIFFERENT FOR A. ASPERA AND A. SPINOSA
The gene trees derived from the mitochondrial data recovered a pattern of subdivision similar to that in the STRUCTURE analyses, but the trees constructed from the nuclear markers did not (Fig. 4). The A spinosa COI gene tree recovered five reciprocally monophyletic clades, with all but the Bahamas having good support (BPP > 0.9). Unlike the STRUCTURE results, Belize and Honduras were reciprocally monophyletic. The A. aspera COI gene tree supported all clusters recovered in the STRUCTURE

analysis (with the exception of the Bahamas) as monophyletic with good support.
The A. spinosa atrop tree recovered a well-supported western Caribbean clade, but eastern Caribbean populations were paraphyletic (Fig. 4). Neither the A. spinosa rag1 tree nor either
of the nuclear DNA trees for A. aspera had any well-supported nodes that correspond to geography. Here, the eastern and western Caribbean clades are defined as being all populations to the east and west of the Mona Passage, respectively, as in Baums et al. (2005) and Taylor and Hellberg (2006), with the western Caribbean clade including the Bahamas.
The gene trees constructed for each marker for both species were used for the GMYC analyses. The results indicated that gene copies had not coalesced within separate populations in A. aspera; there was only one cluster present for all A. aspera markers (LRT P > 0.05). Based on those results, one representative A. aspera allele from each gene was used for the substitution rate estimates.
In A. spinosa, the COI gene copies coalesced within five of the six populations (Puerto Rico and St. Thomas gene copies coalesced together) (LRT P = 0.0028). This indicated that for COI there was a transition from a coalescent to a Yule branching process. For that reason, five representative COI sequences for A. spinosa, corresponding to the five delimited clusters from the GMYC analysis, were used for substitution rate estimates. The GMYC analysis did not indicate any population-level clustering for the A. spinosa nuclear genes (LRT P > 0.05), so one representative allele for each of the two genes were used for substitution rate estimates.
MITOCHONDRIAL SUBSTITUTION RATES ARE UP
TO 37× FASTER THAN FOR NUCLEAR DNA
Substitution rate estimates revealed very rapid mitochondrial rates in Acanthemblemaria. Mitochondrial COI was 37.65× and 14.94× faster than rag1 and atrop, respectively. The mean and 95% upper and lower highest posterior density (HPD) for substitution rates across all taxa in the analysis in substitutions/site/million years for COI, atrop, and rag1 were 5.61 × 10−2 (1.63 × 10−2,

The posterior distribution for the mean substitution rate for atrop was right skewed so the median rate (3.99 × 10−3) was used instead of the mean for all further analyses. These rates corresponded to values of 11.22%, 0.798%, and 0.298% sequence divergence per million years, respectively. The mean rate we have calculated for COI is over six times faster than the highest estimated COI substitution rate listed in Lessios (2008) (1.77% per million years) for geminate reef fish taxa assumed to have split at the final closure of the Central America Isthmus. For rag1, our mean rate is approximately three times faster than that in Lessios (2008) (0.097% per million years), although the lower bound of the posterior distribution of our estimate overlaps with that of Lessios.
TRANSISTHMIAN DIVERGENCE TIME ESTIMATES
ARE CONCORDANT AMONG MARKERS AND ROBUST TO THE MODEL OF SEQUENCE EVOLUTION
Estimates of divergence time for the transisthmian species pair A. betinensis and A. exilispinus agreed among markers and revealed a split before the final closure of the Isthmus of Panama. The mean and 95% HPDs for dates across the isthmus (TMRCA for A. betinensis and A. exilispinus) were 4.63 my (3.10, 8.17) for COI, 4.62 my (3.10, 8.14) for atrop, and 4.67 my (3.10,
8.41) for rag1. These estimated values showed that the divergence time estimates did not simply return the calibration prior for the divergence date (7.0 my (3.28, 28.92)) specified in BEAST.
Published estimates for COI substitution rates from Lessios (2008) recovered significantly older dates when they were used to estimate divergence across the isthmus, but the use of the published rag1 rates did not. For the slower COI rate from Lessios, 1.03% per million years, the mean and upper and lower 95% HPDs for inferred divergence times using the GTR + 􏵏 model selected by jModelTest were 37.84 (25.94, 50.93) million years ago (mya). When the K2P model was used, dates of 20.31 (16.64, 23.93) mya were recovered. For the faster substitution rate, 1.77% per million years, divergence times when using GTR + 􏵏 are 21.92 (15.08, 29.58) mya. The dates inferred when using K2P were 11.82 (9.72, 14.012) mya. When the rag1 rate from Lessios (2008) (0.097% per million years) was used, and the K2P model, the inferred mean and upper and lower 95% divergence dates for A. exilispinus and A. betinensis were 7.25 (1.60, 14.29) mya.
Mean divergence time for A. exilispinus and A. betinensis did not differ from those inferred using the exponential calibration prior when the K2P model from Lessios (2008) was used, and neither did mean substitution rate estimates. For COI the mean, lower, and upper 95% HPDs for divergence time using the K2P

model were 4.62 (3.1, 8.19) for COI, 4.64 (3.1, 8.21) for atrop, and 4.64 (3.1, 8.25) mya for rag1. The mean substitution rates using the K2P model for COI, atrop, and rag1 were 2.72 × 10−2 (1.0 × 10−2, 4.32 × 10−2), 4.05 × 10−3 (5.45 × 10−4, 1.05 × 10−2), and 1.47 × 10−3 (2.45 × 10−4 , 2.87 × 10−3 ) substitutions/site/million years, respectively.
DEMOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION REVEALS MULTIPLE EXPANSIONS AND LARGE EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZES
Reconstructions of historical demography revealed a recent population expansion in A. aspera and older expansions in both species. Test results for population size change in A. aspera based on summary statistics differed between markers (Table 3). For the combined datasets, the two nuclear markers showed a significant signal of population expansion, whereas the COI data did not. The results from individual A. aspera populations were also mixed. For COI, a strong signal of population expansion was only inferred for the Bahamas (although there was some support for an
expansion in Honduras). Likewise, the atrop data only recovered a strong signal of expansion in a single population, St. Maarten (Table 3). However, for rag1, expansions were detected in five of six individual populations, with the exception of the Bahamas.
In contrast to the results from the summary statistics, the Bayesian skyride tests did not recover significant size changes for individual A. aspera populations for any markers surveyed (Supporting Information). However, the skyride plots for the combined datasets recovered signals of significant size change for all three markers (Fig. 5), all in the form of population expansions.
The historical demography of A. spinosa inferred using frequency-based tests differed from that of A. aspera. Although there was little support from the A. aspera COI data for expansions in individual populations, four of six A. spinosa populations did show a signal of expansion (Table 3). However, like in A. aspera, the atrop data recovered a strong signal of expansion in only a single population (also in St. Maarten). In addition, two populations had significantly positive Tajima’s D values (Puerto Rico and St. Thomas A. spinosa for atrop) and may have undergone

   population declines, although that signal was not found for the other two A. spinosa markers (Table 3).
Signals of population size changes were found in the combined A. spinosa datasets. In the case of the COI data, a significant signal of population decline was found. However, that result may stem from the deep divergence at COI among A. spinosa populations, which would cause significant positive values of Tajima’s D. Of the two nuclear markers, only the rag1 data showed a signal of expansion in A. spinosa (Table 3). A recent meta-analysis by Wares (2010) found that Tajima’s D values calculated from mitochondrial sequence data in natural populations are biased toward a deviation from neutrality and toward negative values, which could give a false signal of population expansion or a selective sweep. We do not believe that the bias observed by Wares has influenced our results. There are no significantly negative Tajima’s D values in our results that are not supported by at least one of the other frequency-based tests of neutrality (Table 3). In addition, there were cases in which a significant signal of expansion was detected by the other two tests, but not by using Tajima’s D.
As in A. aspera, the Bayesian skyride tests did not recover significant size changes for any individual populations for any
marker (Supporting Information). The skyride plots for the combined datasets recovered signals of significant size change for two-third of the combined A. spinosa datasets, both in the form of a population expansion (Fig. 5). The third plot, COI, showed a signal of decline, which, as with the summary statistics, was likely due to the large genetic divergence among populations.
Mitochondrial and nuclear markers recovered different root heights and times of population size changes both within and between species (Fig. 5). In the case of A. aspera, the atrop plot showed a signal of population expansion for nearly the entire history of the sample, as evidenced by the median effective population size. The rag1 dataset showed an older maximum root height than in atrop, although the 95% HPD estimates of the root height for the two genes overlapped. The rag1 dataset did not suggest population expansion until roughly 500,000 years ago— the same time as the inferred expansion using atrop, showing concordance between the markers.
The A. aspera COI dataset recovered a significantly younger TMRCA and a more recent expansion than the nuclear markers (Fig. 5). The upper root height for the COI dataset was 35,000 years, over 14-fold younger than either of the nuclear

Both A. spinosa nuclear genes recovered signals of expansions, but the inferred timing of the expansions and root heights differed between the markers. The atrop dataset showed a population expansion that began ∼400,000 years ago and a maximum TMRCA of 690,000 years, neither of which were significantly

different from A. aspera atrop. In contrast, the rag1 data showed an expansion that began earlier, 1.5 mya, and a significantly older maximum root height than atrop (and A. aspera rag1) of 2.1 my. Individual population-level comparisons (Supporting Information), did not recover significantly different root heights between the species for any of the markers or populations.
The effective population sizes that were estimated from the datasets where all populations were combined did not differ significantly between species for any of the markers (Supporting Information). The results from the nuclear markers showed that both species have large effective population sizes, over 15 million. Individual populations also had large effective sizes for both species (Supporting Information), with median numbers of individuals ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 million, consistent with reported population densities (Clarke 1994) and museum collections (Greenfield 1981; Greenfield and Johnson 1990). The COI estimates, representing the effective number of females, were significantly lower than those for the nuclear datasets with median effective population sizes for A. aspera and A. spinosa of 463,000 and 693,000 individuals, respectively.
Discussion
Recent studies have found that pelagic larval duration can be a poor predictor of differences in 􏵖ST among marine species (Bowen et al. 2006; Weersing and Toonen 2009). We found the opposite to be true for A. aspera and A. spinosa: the two species have identical pelagic larval durations (21–24 days) (Johnson and Brothers 1989) and showed near-identical patterns of pairwise 􏵖ST values (Table 1) and genetic differentiation as reported by STRUCTURE (Fig. 2). These concordant patterns of subdivision recovered from frequency-based analyses were, however, superficial and misleading. Acanthemblemaria spinosa has far greater COI divergence than A. aspera (∼20×) among populations (Table 2), a difference ignored by the 􏵖ST and STRUCTURE analyses because they treat all alleles identically, regardless of the number of substitutions separating them. Inferred patterns of historical demography (Fig. 5) differed between mitochondrial and nuclear markers, which may be due to the very rapid rate of mitochondrial evolution in these fish. This rapid rate has obscured signals of old expansions for both species, which were only revealed by nuclear DNA. However, the mitochondrial DNA, in conjunction with the nuclear DNA, allowed us to recover temporally separated population expansions in A. aspera.
SUBSTITUTION RATES
The large level of mtDNA sequence divergence among populations that we found for A. spinosa (Table 2) is surprising for a marine fish with a 21–24 day pelagic larval duration. This level of sequence divergence may not be unique to A. spinosa; a phylogeo-
graphic study on Acanthemblemaria from the eastern Pacific also found high mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence among populations (Lin et al. 2009). Our results here reveal a mitochondrial substitution rate that is high both in absolute terms and relative to nuclear rates in the same species, and demonstrate the effect that incorrect substitution rate estimates have on the estimation of population genetic parameters.
The inferred COI substitution rate of 11.22% per million years is one of the fastest vertebrate mitochondrial rates known (Nabholz et al. 2008, 2009; Welch et al. 2008). One possible reason for the fast mitochondrial rate we estimated would be that the transisthmian calibration we employed was incorrect and that divergence occurred long before the closure of the isthmus, as seen in other taxa (Knowlton et al. 1993; Marko 2002; Lessios 2008). The use of slower rates seen in other teleosts discounts this possibility. When the slowest COI rate from Lessios (2008) for transisthmian geminate fish (1.03% per million years) was used, the mean inferred divergence for A. exilispinus and A. betinensis was 37.8 mya (confidence interval of 50.9 to 25.9 mya). At that time, abyssal water depths connected the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic (Lessios 2008), making an initial divergence between species that live in close association with coral reefs and in 1 m of water unlikely. For the maximum substitution rate listed in Lessios (2008), 1.77% per million years, and using the K2P model, mean divergence time is 11.8 mya with upper and lower bounds of 14.0 and 9.7. These dates would also place the initial divergence of the A. exilispinus and A. betinensis at a time when appropriate habitat did not exist.
In contrast, the substitution rates inferred for the nuclear genes do not appear to be exceptionally fast. The value we obtained for rag1, 0.30% per million years, was faster than that listed in Lessios (2008) for rag1. However, when the rate from Lessios (2008) was used in BEAST analyses (0.097% per million years), the confidence interval on the transisthmian divergence overlapped the one obtained here in the analysis using the exponential prior on divergence time. The substitution rate estimated for atrop, 0.80% per million years, agreed with published estimates for autosomal introns in birds (0.72% per million years) (Axelsson et al. 2004). Together, these data support an exceptionally fast mitochondrial substitution rate in Acanthemblemaria.
These results illustrate the problems that could be introduced by using a published substitution rate that is inappropriate for the taxa under consideration by causing substantial bias in demographic parameters. In addition to the extreme overestimation of divergence times illustrated above, effective population size estimates would be systematically overestimated by using a substitution rate that is too slow. An incorrect substitution rate also leads to biases in coalescent estimation of population size change and migration rates as these values are dependent on substitution rate.
 3392 EVOLUTION DECEMBER2010

         The ratio of mitochondrial to nuclear exon substitution rate, 37.6:1, is also one of the greatest known for animals (Caccone et al. 2004; Willett and Burton 2004; Oliveira et al. 2008; The Nasonia Genome Working Group 2010). This large ratio may have consequences for postzygotic isolation due to epistasis between co-adapted nuclear and mitochondrial genotypes. Proteins encoded in the mitochondrial genome, such as those responsible for oxidative phosphorylation, directly interact with nuclear-encoded proteins. Gene products from each genome must be able to work properly with each other, or organismal breakdown may occur. This has been seen in hybrids with mismatched nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (Rawson and Burton 2002; Burton et al. 2006; The Nasonia Genome Working Group 2010). In Nasonia wasps, nuclear genes that interact directly with the mitochondrion have a significantly higher synonymous-to-nonsynonymous substitution ratio (dN/dS) than those that do not (The Nasonia Genome Working Group 2010). Finding similarly high compensatory dN/dS ratios in Acanthemblemaria would suggest the possibility of coevolution of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes that could lead to hybrid breakdown through cyto-nuclear disequilibrium in these fish.
DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORIES OF A. ASPERA
AND A. SPINOSA
Our demographic analyses revealed two bouts of population expansion: older expansions of both species and a younger one specific to A. aspera. The former was recovered by nuclear DNA, the latter by mitochondrial DNA. Alone, neither marker type, mitochondrial or nuclear, would have provided a complete picture of the historical demography of these fish.
The nuclear data recovered a population expansion dating to 400,000–500,000 years ago for both species, although the A. spinosa rag1 data indicate a significantly older expansion than A. spinosa atrop, beginning ∼1.5 mya (Fig. 5), as well as a significantly older root age (Supporting Information). This discrepancy between nuclear loci probably arose from coalescent stochasticity, as different markers in the nuclear genome can have different times to their most recent common ancestor.
The COI skyride plot for all A. aspera populations combined recovered a population expansion beginning ∼20,000 year ago. This coincides with the last glacial maximum, a period of lowered sea levels when there was 89% less available shelf area in the Caribbean basin (Bellwood and Wainwright 2002) than at present. This reduced habitat availability may have caused reduced population sizes in A. aspera. Such a population bottleneck would cause the root of the COI gene tree to appear to be quite young. As glaciers receded and sea level in the Caribbean basin rose (Lambeck et al. 2002), habitat suitable for coral reef species was restored (Montaggioni 2000) and populations grew. Genetic signatures of population expansion that date to increased habitat
availability following maximum global glaciation have also been found in other coral reef fishes (Fauvelot et al. 2003; Rocha et al. 2005; Thacker et al. 2008).
Within A. aspera, then, mitochondrial and nuclear markers recovered different aspects of population history. The older population expansion may reflect the initial spread of both species throughout the Caribbean at the time of speciation and would account for the discrepancy between the inferred gene tree root heights of the mitochondrial and nuclear markers.
A single gene region cannot recover a population history older than the most recent bottleneck (Heled and Drummond 2008) which, due to its smaller effective population size, should be more recent for mitochondrial than nuclear data. The severity and recency of the most recent bottleneck would affect the height of the gene tree, whereas the substitution rate of the mitochondria would determine the amount of signal that would be available to detect the recovery. The pattern of recent expansion revealed by COI was nearly hidden by high rates of substitution, which resulted in fixed mitochondrial haplotypes among populations that may have been interpreted as evidence for long-term isolation. This is evidenced by most A. aspera populations having private alleles and corrected 􏵖ST values of 1, which is not the expectation under a scenario of population growth (Excoffier et al. 2009).
Although both species shelter in holes in corals, they differ in their microhabitat use and in their propensity to go locally extinct (Clarke 1994, 1996). Acanthemblemaria spinosa is found in shallower water than A. aspera (Clarke 1994), although the two overlap at intermediate depths. Acanthemblemaria spinosa occurs only in high-profile shelters up off the reef in living or standing dead coral, whereas the less-specialized A. aspera can persist in low-profile habitat on the reef surface in coral rubble (Clarke 1994). These differences in microhabitat use give A. spinosa a greater propensity to go locally extinct. Thus, the same processes that can cause A. spinosa populations to decline (when living and standing dead coral is destroyed and reduced to rubble) can allow A. aspera populations to grow (Clarke 1996).
Given what is known about the differences in microhabitat requirements of these fish, the expectation is that A. aspera populations should be more stable over time than A. spinosa populations, at least at ecological time scales. In addition to local high-frequency demographic cycles, regional changes in habitat availability due to glaciation would also be expected to favor persistence of A. aspera populations over A. spinosa at evolutionary time scales. Given that A. spinosa lives in shallower waters than A. aspera, the substantial reduction in shelf area during intervals of low sea level would be expected to have a greater effect on A. spinosa than A. aspera.
In this study, however, we found demographic patterns that were at odds with those predicted by the ecology and life histories

of these blennies. On the one hand, the similarities in the life histories of the two species did not translate into concordant demographic histories. On the other hand, the differences we did find in the historical demography of the two species were in the opposite direction than expected from their differences in microhabitat use. Although there was a signal of recoveries from bottlenecks in individual A. spinosa populations, as suggested by point estimates (Table 3) and TCS haplotype distributions (although Bayesian skyride tests did not), there was no evidence of a range-wide extirpation for the species. However, A. aspera appears to have undergone a range-wide bottleneck. Together, our results indicate that, compared to A. aspera, A. spinosa populations were better able to persist during lower sea levels at the last glacial maximum.
It is not clear then why we recovered a pattern of range-wide population expansion in A. aspera and population persistence in A. spinosa. In previous comparative studies of historical demography in marine taxa, interspecific ecological differences correlated well with habitat requirements (Marko 2004; Hickerson and Cunningham 2005). However, those studies involved intertidal taxa that were directly affected by glaciation. It may be that less obvious factors than ecological differences are responsible for contrasting demographic patterns in coral reef taxa resulting from sea-level changes. Sampling of additional nuclear markers to test for multiple population size changes using a method such as the extended Bayesian skyline plot (Heled and Drummond 2008) could provide further insight into the timing and degree of demographic changes through multiple glacial cycles.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study illustrates that mitochondrial and nuclear markers can reveal complementary information in historical demographic studies. The smaller effective size and rapid substitution rate of the mitochondrial DNA allowed the inference of a recent population expansion in A. aspera, whereas the slower nuclear DNA recovered an older expansion for both species. However, the rapid mitochondrial substitution rate also obscured the recent expansion in A. aspera. Analyses of the mitochondrial data using frequencybased metrics alone did not indicate the underlying population expansions in A. aspera, neither young, nor old. The results of the frequency-based tests, coupled with the STRUCTURE results, lead to a pattern of subdivision that was very similar to that of A. spinosa even though the underlying demography of the two species was quite different.
