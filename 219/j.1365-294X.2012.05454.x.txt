Abstract
Isolation by adaptation increases divergence at neutral loci when natural selection against immigrants reduces the rate of gene flow between different habitats. This can occur early in the process of adaptive divergence and is a key feature of ecological speciation. Despite the ability of isolation by distance (IBD) and other forms of landscape resistance to produce similar patterns of neutral divergence within species, few studies have used landscape genetics to control for these other forces. We have studied the divergence of Helianthus petiolaris ecotypes living in active sand dunes and adjacent non-dune habitat, using landscape genetics approaches, such as circuit theory and multiple regression of distance matrices, in addition to coalescent modelling. Divergence between habitats was significant, but not strong, and was shaped by IBD. We expected that increased resistance owing to patchy and unfavourable habitat in the dunes would contribute to divergence. Instead, we found that landscape resistance models with lower resistance in the dunes performed well as predictors of genetic distances among subpopulations. Nevertheless, habitat class remained a strong predictor of genetic distance when controlling for isolation by resistance and IBD. We also measured environmental variables at each site and confirmed that specific variables, especially soil nitrogen and vegetation cover, explained a greater proportion of variance in genetic distance than did landscape or the habitat classification alone. Asymmetry in effective population sizes and numbers of migrants per generation was detected using coalescent modelling with Bayesian inference, which is consistent with incipient ecological speciation being driven by the dune habitat.

Introduction
When populations diverge owing to different ecological conditions, despite continuing gene flow between them, ecological speciation can be the outcome. In such cases, divergence can be hastened not only by the reduction in gene flow between populations that results from their spatial separation but also by the barrier to migration created by selection against maladapted immigrants (Barton & Bengtsson 1986; Gavrilets & Cruzan 1998). This process, often called ‘isolation by adapta-

tion’ (IBA) or ‘ecologically dependent reproductive isolation’, is a key component of the picture of ecological speciation that has been emerging for the past several decades (Hendry 2004; Nosil et al. 2009).
Selection against immigrants is taxonomically widespread (Mallet & Barton 1989; Nagy & Rice 1997; Sambatti & Rice 2006; Tobler et al. 2009) and has important implications as a reproductive barrier (Nosil et al. 2005). The impact on divergence at neutral loci that are unlinked to the targets of selection has been observed in a number of species, including walking-sticks (Nosil et al. 2008), sticklebacks (McCairns & Bernatchez 2008) and silverswords (Friar et al. 2007). Evidence of IBA is most convincing when isolation by distance (IBD) and

other non-adaptive forces are accounted for. Yet in very few cases have the tools of landscape ecology and genetics been applied to studies of ecological divergence (McCairns & Bernatchez 2008; Freedman et al. 2010). In the present study, we used neutral molecular markers in a landscape genetics framework to test the hypothesis that IBA contributes to ecotypic divergence.
Identifying IBA requires that other factors that could generate genotype–environment associations be accounted for. In addition to sharing a habitat, members of one population are likely to be closer to one another than to individuals outside the population. For this reason, they are expected to share more genes with each other than with members of other populations as a result of IBD, even in the absence of any non-neutral processes. The tendency of different parts of the landscape to gene flow can also shape genetic connectivity among subpopulations and play a role in the divergence of populations (Manel et al. 2003). Landscape geneticists have employed several methods to study this process, mainly in the context of animal conservation ecology (Storfer et al. 2010). Prominent among these is a form of circuit analysis that analyses spatially structured gene flow in a way similar to electrical current, which is impeded by materials of high electrical resistance or by narrow conduits (McRae 2006; McRae et al. 2008). The appeal of this approach lies partly in its ability to consider a number of possible paths of movement between two points, treating the landscape as an electrical network. The ecological analogue of electrical conductance (the inverse of resistance) is the exchange of migrants, which in animals may be most easily interpreted as resulting from the choices made by individual animals. In annual plants, however, the resistance of a given habitat type is determined by its impact on dispersal distances and the suitability for growth and reproduction of propagules dispersing to it (McRae & Beier 2007). The genetic isolation that is attributable to the resistance landscape is termed isolation by resistance (IBR) (McRae 2006). The key difference between IBR and IBA is that IBR is determined by the landscape and by the intrinsic biology of the organism, whereas IBA results from the interaction between specific genotypes and the environments to which they are well or poorly adapted. IBR is often a better predictor of population differentiation than IBD (McRae & Beier 2007; Row et al. 2010; Moore et al. 2011), making it a suitable null hypothesis for the identification of IBA. Therefore, it is important to test for associations between habitats and genetic divergence in a model that accounts for both geographic distance and the most likely factors contributing to landscape resistance (Manel et al. 2010a).
Associations of genetic distance with environmental gradients might arise without IBA if the edge of the habitat patch coincides with a barrier to gene flow (e.g. endogenous reproductive isolation, Bierne et al. 2011). Although this may be unlikely in many cases, the possibility should be considered as an alternative explanation for strong divergence between habitats. Fortunately, this issue can be addressed if habitat patches do not have sharp edges or if the environmental variables that characterize the habitats vary within habitat types. In such cases, the association between genetic structure and environmental differences among sampling locations is a useful way of testing for IBA (McCairns & Bernatchez 2008; Manel et al. 2010b).
We have studied an extreme case of ecotypic divergence with gene flow in the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris. This annual sunflower occurs in sandy soils throughout the mid-west and southwest of the USA. Uniquely however, in the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in Colorado, the species occurs abundantly in active sand dunes; indeed, at this location, it inhabits the tallest dune system in North America. While maintaining the characteristic features of H. petiolaris, the dune ecotype is morphologically differentiated in the field and in common garden experiments (R. Andrew, unpublished). For example, the dune form produces large seeds, which are thought to be an adaptation to habitat in the dune endemic, Helianthus anomalus (Donovan et al. 2010).
The dune ecotype of H. petiolaris is intriguing because it appears to be diverging despite ample opportunities for gene exchange with the typical form of the species, which occurs in habitats surrounding the active dune field in the stabilized sandy soils of the sand sheet, vegetated dune and alluvial deposits. Subpopulations of the different ecotypes are in some cases separated by <100 m, which is well within the range of many insect pollinators. Three non-mutually exclusive forces may help to maintain the divergent ecotypes in the face of likely gene flow. First, IBD might reduce gene flow between the core of the dune population and the nondune form. Second, tall dunes and large stretches of bare sand may act as barriers to dispersal within the dunes, which could add IBR to the effect of geographic isolation on the differentiation of sunflower populations. Third, the dune and non-dune habitats might differ so greatly that immigrants may be unable to survive or reproduce: in effect, IBA. We set out to test which of these hypotheses fit the patterns of neutral genetic divergence within the system by analysing variation at microsatellite loci in the context of geography and environmental variables. In particular, our aim was to test whether IBA remained a good predictor of genetic differentiation when other forces were also considered.

As well as characterizing neutral divergence between the sunflower ecotypes, we used the techniques of landscape genetics to identify the signature of IBA in two ways. We first asked whether genetic divergence between ecotypes is greater than that within ecotypes. We then confirmed that this divergence is greater than would be expected based on geographic distance alone, also taking into account differences between habitats in landscape resistance to gene flow. Our second approach was to measure environmental variables at each site and to search for significant associations with genetic distance, to identify environmental variables that might be driving divergence. By confirming that genetic distance is related to environmental variables, this approach supported to the hypothesis of IBA.
Materials and methods
Sampling
In September 2008, we visited 21 subpopulations of Helianthus petiolaris in Great Sand Dunes National Park (Table 1). These included subpopulations growing in the main dune field, the non-dune habitat surrounding the dune field and intermediate habitats at the margin of the dune field. At each sampling location, we sampled seeds from 15 to 30 plants, each separated by at least 1 m.
Plot data
In May 2009, we returned to these sampling locations to deploy plant root simulator (PRS) probes (Western Ag Innovations, Saskatoon, SK, Canada), which use ion exchange membranes to measure soil nutrient availability. Four pairs of probes (anion and cation exchangers) were deployed per site, each at the southeastern corner of a 1 · 1 m quadrat. For each quadrat, we recorded the percentage cover of grasses, forbs, debris and bare ground. At the time of assessment, most sunflower seedlings had emerged but were still at the cotyledon stage. In September 2009, the nutrient probes were collected and processed. In some cases, markers had been blown away or disturbed by animals, and probes could not be recovered.
In the landscape genetics analysis, subpopulations were represented by mean values of the environmental variables. Soil nutrient probes were pooled during analysis by Western Ag Innovations, so no averaging was necessary. Subpopulation means for the cover data were estimated using generalized linear models with a logit link function. Additional composite variables were generated by principal components analysis (PCA) of standardized soil or cover data. The vegetation cover classes were arcsine-square-root-transformed prior to PCA.

Molecular data
DNA was extracted from frozen tissue using a modified CTAB method (Doyle & Doyle 1987). Transcriptomederived microsatellite loci from previous studies (Kane & Rieseberg 2007, 2008; Yatabe et al. 2007) were tested in a subset of the Great Sand Dunes NPP samples. The remaining individuals were genotyped at the 15 most reliable loci, plus one anonymous microsatellite located close to a quantitative trait locus for seed weight (ORS847; Lexer et al. 2005). Summary statistics are given in Tables S3 and S4 (Supporting information). Microsatellite alleles were amplified following Kane et al. (2009), separated using an ABI3730 and scored using ABI GeneMapper (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). In about half of the loci, allele sizes did not always differ by multiples of the repeat unit, which is not unusual for cross-amplified microsatellites.
Analysis
Genetic structure: differentiation of ecotypes. Genetic structure was investigated using a number of approaches: (i) analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and F-statistics; (ii) PCA; and (iii) non-hierarchical Bayesian clustering.
Weir & Cockerham’s (1984) single-locus and multilocus hST were estimated with and without correcting for null alleles in FREENA (Chapuis & Estoup 2007). Using GENALEX (Peakall & Smouse 2006), multilevel AMOVA was performed on all samples or on the dune and non-dune subpopulations only (i.e. omitting the intermediate sampling locations). This allowed differentiation between ecotypes to be assessed while taking into account the subpopulation structure within each habitat type. Shannon’s index offers a means to partition diversity within and among groups, which complements AMOVA and F-statistics (Sherwin et al. 2006). This analysis, also performed in GENALEX, permits a goodness-of-fit test of differentiation, as well as population-specific indices of information.
We next asked whether the ecotype delineation represents natural groups by performing principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) at the subpopulation level. Based on pairwise Euclidean genetic distance, we performed correlation-standardized PCoA at the subpopulation level in GENALEX.
To explore the genetic groups within the samples, non-hierarchical Bayesian clustering was performed using the program Structure 2.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000; Falush et al. 2003, 2007). The correlated allele frequency model with admixture was used with a burn-in of 1 million replicates, followed by 4 million replicates, with convergence monitored for each run. Ten runs were performed for each value of K, and the output was
interpreted with Structure Harvester (Earl 2011), using the methods of Pritchard et al. (2000) and Evanno et al. (2005); CLUMPP was used to average admixture proportions over runs (Jakobsson & Rosenberg 2007).
Isolation by distance. IBD was tested in two ways. First, a Mantel test was performed in GENALEX between pairwise genetic distance (average Euclidean distance between subpopulations) and geographic distance, with 10 000 permutations. In addition, spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed on genetic distances between subpopulations in GENALEX 6.4 (Smouse & Peakall 1999; Peakall & Smouse 2006). Multiple distance classes were tested to have the best chance of identifying spatial genetic structure, and analyses were repeated at both population and individual levels. Permutation and bootstrap tests were conducted with 10 000 replicates in each case.
Landscape genetics. Comprehensive modelling of connectivity in this system is outside the scope of this study, as there were not sufficient sampling locations to test complex explanatory scenarios. For this reason, we limited our hypotheses to those that could be tested based on simple matrix comparisons with pairwise genetic distances between subpopulations. Several measures of genetic divergence or differentiation were considered, but only the results using the Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards genetic distance are shown here, as it was consistently the most strongly associated with both geographic and environmental distances. To ask whether genetic divergence between ecotypes is greater than that within ecotypes, we generated a pairwise matrix of habitat differences. All within-habitat-type comparisons were assigned a value of 0, whereas all dune vs. nondune comparisons were assigned a value of 1. Comparisons of dune or non-dune subpopulations with those in intermediate habitat were assigned a value of 0.5. In addition to Mantel and partial Mantel tests (Legendre & Fortin 1989), this matrix was then used as a predictor matrix in an analysis based on these procedures, multiple regression of distance matrices (MRDM), in which genetic distance was the response variable (Lichstein 2007). Briefly, partial regression slopes are estimated using standard multiple linear regression, but the significance of each term is determined by randomly permuting the explanatory variables one at a time while holding the others constant. Both approaches were implemented using the ecodist package in the statistical program R (R Core Development Team, 2011), with 100 000 permutations per model.
We wished to assess the power of habitat to predict genetic distance in the face of competing hypotheses. The first of these is that IBD generates patchy spatial

genetic structure, which happens to coincide with the dunes by chance. That is, dune populations are genetically similar to one another simply because of their spatial proximity (IBD). We accounted for this explanation by controlling for geographic distance while testing for an association between genetic distance and habitat difference. If selection against immigrants does indeed present a barrier to gene flow, this association should persist when controlling for IBD.
The second alternative hypothesis we wished to consider was that differences in landscape resistance between the dune and non-dune habitat enhance differentiation. We used circuit theory (McRae & Beier 2007; McRae & Shah 2009) to characterize potential differences in landscape resistance associated with vegetation type. The Great Sand Dunes Vegetation map (Salas et al. 2010) was reclassified in ARCGIS 9.3 and exported using the add-in Export to Circuitscape by Jeff Jenness (http://www.circuitscape.org/Circuitscape/ArcGIS.html). The map was converted to a raster with 30 · 30 m grid cells and reclassified into three habitat classes: (A) bare dune, (B) vegetated sunflower habitat and (C) impermeable non-habitat (Fig. 1, Table S1, Supporting information). Briefly, stable patches of vegetation in the dune field and ponderosa pine grassy woodland in the foot-
hills were both classified as B as they represent suitable sunflower habitat. Although some sunflowers grow on bare dune faces, their numbers and reproductive output are usually much lower than those growing in the more vegetated patches. Helianthus petiolaris is specialized on sandy soils and does not tolerate salt, montane, forest and sabkha vegetation types, which were classified as C. An infinite resistance (conductance = 0) was always assigned to class C. Circuitscape (McRae & Shah 2009) was used to calculate total resistance between pairs of populations, based on average resistance and fourneighbour connections only. Using average conductance and eight-neighbour connections did not affect the results substantially. To parameterize the resistance surface, a range of conductance values were assigned to habitat classes A and B. We first optimized the univariate association with genetic distance before including habitat in the model (Spear et al. 2010). Because the resulting pairwise resistance matrix scales with the resistance (or conductance) surface and the magnitude does not affect MRDM on scaled matrices, we controlled the A and B conductances to vary the dune⁄ non-dune conductance ratio. The resulting resistance matrix was considered as a representation of IBR at the scale of the study.

Areas shown in black are considered impermeable (conductance = 0; class C) in all analyses, whereas non-dune and dune habitat (classes B and A, represented by green and tan areas, respectively) are assigned varying levels of conductance to find the best fit to the genetic distance matrix.

MRDM and partial Mantel tests were used to test the effect of habitat on genetic distance while controlling for IBD and IBR. A positive result would be interpreted as evidence that IBA helps to explain the differentiation of the sunflower ecotypes. The advantage of landscape resistance over geographic distance was first tested by omitting habitat from the full model. However, it should be noted that this is not a straightforward test of IBD compared with IBR, as the resistance matrices integrate both distance and landscape resistance when resistance is non-zero. One-sided P-values were used throughout the analysis of distance matrices, and all distance matrices (including genetic and habitat distances) were scaled to zero mean and unit variance so that MRDM models yielded standardized partial regression slopes.
Our second approach was to test the association of genetic distance with environmental variables measured at each site. These give a more detailed description of the habitat variation and vary on a more continuous scale than the coarse habitat classification. Thus, genetic distance may be better predicted by environmental variation than by habitat classification alone. Using MRDM with Euclidean distances along soil and vegetation cover axes included as predictor variables, we tested whether these variables were significantly associated with genetic distance while controlling for geographic distance and vegetation resistance. We then asked whether this association persisted when habitat class was also included in the model. As multiple tests were conducted, we adjusted P-values using the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) procedure for controlling false discovery rate. We aimed to identify (i) candidate variables that may be driving differentiation between ecotypes and (ii) proxy variables that may be used as functional measures of dune-like characteristics for future studies.
Asymmetric migration. In order to assess the direction of gene flow between the ecotypes, we obtained Bayesian estimates of migration rates and effective population sizes using MIGRATE-N (Beerli & Felsenstein 2001; Beerli 2006). This program fits a coalescent island model to the data, allowing asymmetric migration rates. The subpopulations exhibiting the least admixture were selected and pooled for each ecotype. These were dune subpopulations 1003, 1180, 1240 and 1300 and non-dune subpopulations 970, 1363, 1500 and 2250, yielding total sample sizes of 63 and 61, respectively. Three microsatellite loci (HT536, HT520 and HT279) were excluded because many of their alleles differed by only a single base pair. Most of the alleles at the remaining loci varied in size by multiples of the repeat unit length. The few that did not were adjusted to fit a stepwise model of repeat mutation with as little loss of information as possible.
Uniform prior distributions ranging from 0 to 100 were used for both theta and M, with starting values estimated from FST. Relative mutation rates were estimated from the data, and a Brownian mutation model was employed. The Metropolis–Hastings algorithm was used to sample from the prior distributions and generate posterior distributions. Two replicate runs with 500 000 recorded steps and a sampling increment of 100, following 1 million burn-in trees. A static heating scheme was employed with four chains at temperatures of 1, 1.5, 3 and 1 million.
Migration models constraining mutation-scaled theta and ⁄ or migration rate to be symmetric between ecotypes were compared to the full model (containing four parameters). The Bezier approximation to the marginal likelihood was used to test which model fits the data best (Beerli & Palczewski 2010).
Results
Field measurements
The non-dune sites varied greatly but tended to be richer in the major nutrients than the dune or intermediate sites (Fig. 2). The difference between dune and non-dune habitats (excluding the intermediate subpopulations) was significant for total N, NO3-N, P and Ca only; however, this difference was not supported when the false discovery rate was accounted for (Table S2, Supporting information). All cover variables differed significantly between dune and non-dune habitats (Fig. 2, Fig. S1, Table S2, Supporting information). The first three PCoA of the soil nutrients explained 34.5%, 23.2% and 10.6% of the total variation, respectively, while those of the cover variables explained 67.7%, 21.8% and 7.7%, respectively.
Molecular data
Estimates of Weir & Cockerham’s (1984) hST strongly suggested that one locus may be influenced by selection. The hST estimate of HT285 (0.252) was 10 standard deviations greater than the mean of the other 15 loci (mean = 0.035, SD = 0.021) and showed much lower diversity within the dunes than elsewhere (0.09 vs. 0.50). The logratio of genetic diversity (Schlo ̈tterer & Dieringer 2005) in the dune ecotype relative to the non-dune ecotype was )3.9, suggesting that a selective sweep had reduced variation in the region around HT285. When standardized relatively by the overall mean and standard deviation (including HT285), lnRH for HT 285 is highly statistically significant (P = 0.0014). This locus was therefore omitted from all further analyses. ORS847, HT333 and HT440 displayed high FIS, suggesting null alleles;

Shown here are the five variables that are significantly correlated with genetic distance after correction for multiple comparisons (see Fig. S1, Supporting information for other variables). Soil nutrient availability during the growing season was measured using ion exchange probes, and the total absorption was scaled to the maximum burial time (123 days), such that in each case, the unit of measurement was mg ⁄ 10 cm2 ⁄ 123 days. D, dune; I, intermediate; N, non-dune populations.

Global hST was little affected by the inclusion of estimated null allele frequencies (Chapuis & Estoup 2007), as were the landscape genetics analysis described below.
Genetic structure
AMOVA and diversity statistics. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance suggested low, but significant, differentiation between ecotypes; overall, 2.3% of variation occurred among habitat types (P < 0.001), 4.1% among subpopulations (P < 0.001) and 93.5% within subpopulations (P < 0.001). Excluding the intermediate subpopulations, a greater proportion of variance (3.3%) occurred between ecotypes and among subpopulations within ecotypes (4.4%).
Shannon’s diversity index indicated significant differentiation (P < 0.05) for 15 of the 16 loci and much stronger differentiation at HT285 (Table S3, Supporting information). For most loci, the within-group diversity was lower for the dune samples (mean sHa = 1.14) than for the non-dune ones (mean sHa = 1.29). This pattern was much more pronounced for HT285 (0.35 and 2.14, respectively), but most measures of overall diversity were also slightly higher in the non-dune samples than in the dune samples for other loci (Table S4, Supporting information).
Principal coordinates analysis. The proportion of variance explained by each principal coordinates axis dropped off
after axis 1, which represented 42% of the variation (axes 2 and 3 explained 19.9% and 17.35%, respectively). Principal coordinate 1 was strongly associated with ecotypes (Fig. 3), and intermediate subpopulations were nested within the dune subpopulations. In particular, subpopulations 1701 and 1731, from the northeastern part of the dune field, were more similar to the non-dune subpopulations than were the intermediate populations.
Non-hierarchical clustering of individuals. The posterior probability was higher for two subpopulations than for all other values of K, and the Evanno method also supported this model (Fig. S2a,b, Supporting information).

 Most samples with ancestry assigned to cluster 1 were from the non-dune habitat, while most cluster 2 individuals were from dune populations (Fig. 4, Fig. S3a, Supporting information). However, the 90% probability interval for each individual included either 1 or 0 (Fig. S3b, Supporting information), indicating that this analysis does not provide fine resolution of individual admixture, possibly due to the low level of overall differentiation. Separate analysis of the dune and nondune subpopulations did not support any further subdivision (Fig. S4, Supporting information). Mapping the ancestry proportions onto sampling locations illustrated three features of the Structure results (Fig. 4): (i) there is a clear association between clusters and habitats; (ii) most dune and non-dune subpopulations show some evidence of admixture; and (iii) subpopulations that are closer to the margin of the dune field have higher proportions of admixture than those in the centre of the dune field or more distant from the dunes (Fig. 5).
At the subpopulation level, the proportion of dune ancestry was negatively correlated with Shannon’s

Impermeable (Imp.) vegetation types include unsuitable habitat for Helianthus petiolaris, whereas bare sand and other non-dune vegetation types are considered permeable to sunflower migration. Subpopulations included in the Migrate-N analysis are shown in bold and italic script (dune: 1003, 1180, 1240, 1300; non-dune: 970, 1363, 1500, 2250).
index (Fig. S5a, Supporting information). This indicates that a greater proportion of variation is unique to each non-dune population than to each dune population. Indeed, Shannon’s index was low in the centre of the dune field and highest in the non-dune subpopulations most distant from the dunes (Fig. S5b, Supporting information).
Isolation by distance
The Mantel statistic based on pairwise Euclidean genetic distance and geographic distance was positive (Rxy = 0.126, P = 0.003), indicating that IBD explains a significant proportion of the variance in genetic distance among pairs of subpopulations. Both permutation and bootstrap tests detected significant spatial genetic autocorrelation in the 0to 2.5 -km distance class, but not at greater distances (Fig. 6). This indicates increased similarity between neighbouring pairs of subpopulations. At the individual level, autocorrelation coefficients for distance classes including zero were substantially higher than the autocorrelation coefficients for greater distance classes (Fig. S6, Supporting information), confirming the significant subpopulation-level differentiation detected using AMOVA.
Landscape genetics
Genetic distance was positively associated with both habitat (Mantel’s r = 0.482, P < 0.001) and geographic distance (Mantel’s r = 0.462, P = 0.001). Genetic distances were highest in comparisons between dune and non-dune subpopulations, and intermediate subpopulations were typically most similar to dune subpopulations (Fig. S7, Supporting information).

was set much higher than that of vegetated sunflower habitat (Table S5, Supporting information). The strength of this association continued to increase with this ratio to up to 100 000:1 (Mantel’s r = 0.546, P = 0.0007), but the fit changed very little beyond 100:1 (Mantel’s r = 0.544, P = 0.0009). We chose the resistance matrix generated by Circuitscape based on a 1000:1 ratio as it represented the signal effectively. A cumulative current map based on this analysis is shown in Fig. 1.
When controlling for landscape resistance, genetic distance remained positively associated with habitat distance, but not with geographic distance (Table 2). This implies that landscape resistance effectively captures the influence of Euclidean geographic distance on genetic differentiation, illustrating one of the useful features of circuit theory for landscape genetics. Although linear modelling of distance matrices can only account for the linear components of associations, autocorrelation of genetic, environmental and habitat distance matrices decreased approximately linearly with increasing distance (Fig. S8, Supporting information), so that the linear model was likely to capture the relationships well (Goslee & Urban 2007). To confirm this, we also performed rank-based MRDM, which gave results very similar to those of the linear models.
Genetic distance was more strongly associated with several environmental variables than with habitat distance in univariate models (Table 3). Controlling for landscape resistance in MRDM models, total soil nitrogen, NO3 nitrogen and the second principal components axis based on the soil data had significant partial regression coefficients after adjusting P-values to account for multiple comparisons, as did total cover (Fig. 7, Table S6, Supporting information). Soil calcium, soil sulphur and the first vegetation cover PCA displayed significant univariate associations with genetic distance, but these associations were not significant when controlling for landscape resistance (Table S6, Supporting information).
We further examined the association between genetic distance and the environmental distance matrices by controlling for habitat type as well as landscape resistance. This association remained significant (q < 0.05) for total nitrogen, NO3 nitrogen, and total cover but was marginal for the soil PCA1 (Table 3). Rank-based analysis gave similar results and identified the same variables of interest.

In this model, the posterior distributions for theta had means of 2.7 (95% CI from 0.6 to 4.4) in the dune ecotype and 4.6 (95% CI from 2.4 to 6.6) in the non-dune ecotype. The mutationscaled migration rate was estimated as 3.8 (95% CI from 1.6 to 6.0), implying that the effective number of immigrants per generation was 2.5 into the dune population and 4.4 into the non-dune population. The symmetrical estimate based on Shannon’s diversity decomposition was 7.2, while the FST-based estimate was 7.1 (using FRT = 0.034).
Discussion
The process of adaptive divergence is central to evolution and diversification. It is important to biologists because it can be an early step towards ecological speci-
ation and can also help us to understand the ecological significance of traits that vary between habitats. The role of gene flow has been the subject of much study, and it has emerged that gene flow can both constrain and promote adaptive divergence (Hendry 2004; Garant et al. 2007). This relationship is a complex one, not least because adaptive divergence itself can reduce gene flow between habitats through IBA (Nosil et al. 2005). Using landscape genetics—especially circuit theory—we demonstrate how the effects of IBA can be partially disentangled from positively correlated and potentially confounding factors such as geographic distance and landscape resistance. Also, by integrating our landscape genetic analyses with characterization of habitat differences, we identify key environmental variables (or their proxies) that are responsible for IBA in dune sunflowers.

2088 R. L. ANDREW ET AL. Differentiation and IBD
Although dune-adapted sunflowers, including those closely related to Helianthus petiolaris (Heiser et al. 1969; Rieseberg et al. 1990), are well known, this is the first case of intraspecific divergence in this habitat to be studied. Our investigation into the neutral genetic structure of H. petiolaris at Great Sand Dunes confirmed that the dune and non-dune ecotypes are indeed differentiated at neutral microsatellite loci. This conclusion was supported by AMOVA, Shannon’s diversity, PCoA and Bayesian non-hierarchical clustering. Shannon’s diversity indices provided further insight, suggesting that the genetic diversity that is unique to the dune ecotype is less than that of the non-dune ecotype. This pattern is reiterated at the subpopulation level and is consistent with asymmetrical selection and ⁄ or migration. The latter was supported by coalescent analysis of the ecotypes in an island model. Nevertheless, these analyses do not prove that IBA contributes to this differentiation between ecotypes because habitat differentiation covaries with geographic distance.
Two additional results emerging from these analyses highlight important caveats. First, there appears to be substantial admixture between ecotypes. As expected, based on the spatial scale of the system, genes appear to be moving between habitats, possibly via the movement of pollinators. Second, the genetic variation within and between habitats is clearly spatially structured. This was apparent from the Bayesian clustering approach, as well as spatial autocorrelation analysis and Mantel testing. The intermediate subpopulations displayed the most admixture, followed by subpopulations close to the edge of the dune field, while the populations furthest from the edge showed the least evidence of admixture. However, it is important to note that the marker system used here did not permit the estimation of precise admixture proportions for each individual, possibly because the overall degree of differentiation is insufficient. With greater marker resolution, it may be possible to ask whether individuals with migrant ancestry do indeed possess admixed genomes and whether they are firstor early-generation immigrants.
The divergence between the dune and non-dune ecotypes (FRT = 0.033) is substantially lower than that observed in most studies that have also identified IBA; however, it is within the range observed with similar markers (Friar et al. 2007; McCairns & Bernatchez 2008; Nosil et al. 2009).
Landscape resistance and divergence between habitats
A key test of our hypothesis that selection reduces gene flow between the dune and non-dune ecotypes was the
association of genetic structure with habitat while controlling for geographic distance. However, the influence of geographic distance on dispersal is mediated by landscape features and may be nonlinear (Manel et al. 2003). Alternatives to Euclidean geographic distance have long been used in population genetics as more realistic predictors of dispersal (Kudoh & Whigham 1997; Lugon-Moulin et al. 1999). Landscape genetics has provided examples of intuitively appealing approaches to integrating the effects of distance and barriers or habitat types on gene flow, including cirguit theory (McRae & Beier 2007; McRae et al. 2008). In a simple application of this approach, we considered whether the bare sand of the dunes might represent a barrier to dispersal, which might enhance divergence between the ecotypes. Instead, we found that the circuit model parameterized with higher resistance in the vegetated habitat than over bare sand produced resistance matrices that were better predictors of genetic distance than Euclidean geographic distance.
Reduced resistance over bare sand, compared with vegetated sunflower habitat, is surprising given the proportion of the dune surface that is unfavourable for sunflowers. We expected bare sand to present a barrier to both pollen and seed dispersal, notwithstanding the typical leptokurtic dispersal curves of seed plants (Ellstrand 1992) and evidence for long-distance dispersal (Cain et al. 2000; Crisp et al. 2009). However, highspeed wind is potentially a very effective disperser of seeds in the dunes, provided that sunflower patches provide sufficient seed entrapment for the establishment of migrants (Fort & Richards 1998). In contrast, the shrubby vegetation of the non-dune areas is likely to limit wind-borne seed dispersal. Given sufficiently variable organelle markers, it may be possible in future to assess the relative role of seed and pollen in gene flow in the dune and non-dune habitats. Another potential explanation is that the genetic distances between dune subpopulations are smaller because of the lower genetic diversity of the dune gene pool, which could result from demography or selection. As asymmetric selection is a likely cause of the asymmetric migration and different effective population sizes between the ecotypes, the apparent resistance of the landscape may also reflect asymmetric selection in the different habitats. This underlines the fact that, although IBA and IBR are conceptually different, we are unable to completely disentangle their effects from patterns of genetic divergence in this system. Nevertheless, this resistance matrix is an effective way to account for differences in gene flow across the landscape that might shape divergence between habitat types, allowing us to identify the signature of adaptive divergence in the neutral portions of the genome.

ADAPTATION
Habitat was significantly associated with genetic distance when controlling for landscape resistance, supporting our hypothesis of IBA. However, our investigation into landscape resistance to gene flow was limited by the spatial scale of the sampling. Sampling at a finer scale would allow more detailed investigation into the influence of vegetation on the dispersal of sunflowers within and between ecotypes.
Association of neutral genetic variation with environments
A second test of IBA involved the association of genetic distance with finer-grained measures of environmental variation than those provided by habitat classifications. This comparison is important to rule out an intrinsic barrier to gene flow that coincides with the habitat edge (Bierne et al. 2011), in which case no association between environments and genetic distance is expected once habitat classification and landscape are accounted for. We found several plot characteristics that had significant effects on genetic distance even under these stringent conditions, representing soil nutrient availability and vegetation cover. These results are congruent with the identification of soil nitrogen as an important selective pressure for H. anomalus, a hybrid species that grows in the dunes of Utah and northern Arizona exclusively (Ludwig et al. 2006). Vegetation cover controls sand movement and thus may be acting as a proxy for important unmeasured variables, such as burial and exposure of seedlings (Donovan et al. 2010). Nonetheless, both environmental factors appear to be good indicators of general dune characteristics for future work, although caution should be used as, in this study, they did not fully account for the effect of habitat on genetic distance.
Conclusions
Despite the low level of differentiation among subpopulations, we have shown that habitat and environmental variables are better predictors of neutral genetic distance in our study system than either IBD or isolation by landscape resistance. This supports our hypothesis that adaptation is itself acting as a barrier to gene flow at these neutral loci. A possible caveat is that demography could generate similar patterns; for example, expansion along environmental gradients can produce associations between environments and genetic distance. However, this explanation seems unlikely because levels of gene flow between the dune and nondune populations are high, and associations owing to demographic expansions would be quickly erased. RAD sequencing is currently underway to identify the genomic regions responsible for IBA.
