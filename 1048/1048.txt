Abstract
A wide range of plant lines has been propagated by farmers during crop selection and dissemination, but consequences of this crop diversification on plant-microbe interactions have been neglected. Our hypothesis was that crop evolutionary history shaped the way the resulting lines interact with soil bacteria in their rhizospheres. Here, the significance of maize diversification as a factor influencing selection of soil bacteria by seedling roots was assessed by comparing rhizobacterial community composition of inbred lines representing the five main genetic groups of maize, cultivated in a same European soil. Rhizobacterial community composition of 21-day-old seedlings was analysed using a 16S rRNA taxonomic microarray targeting 19 bacterial phyla. Rhizobacterial community composition of inbred lines depended on the maize genetic group. Differences were largely due to the prevalence of certain Betaproteobacteria and especially Burkholderia, as confirmed by quantitative PCR and cloning⁄sequencing. However, these differences in bacterial root colonization did not correlate with plant microsatellite genetic distances between maize genetic groups or individual lines. Therefore, the genetic structure of maize that arose during crop diversification (resulting in five main groups), but not the extent of maize diversification itself (as determined by maize genetic distances), was a significant factor shaping rhizobacterial community composition of seedlings.

Introduction
Soil microbial community displays high taxonomic and functional diversity, and plays key roles in nutrient cycling and biotic interactions, especially with plants (Raaijmakers et al. 2009). Plant roots are colonized by a wide range of microorganisms, which use organic exudates and other rhizodeposits as growth susbtrates (Berg & Smalla 2009). These microorganisms may have neutral, detrimental or beneficial effects on growth and functioning of the host plant (Escobar & Dandekar 2003; Alabouvette et al. 2006; Tyler & Triplett 2008; Aroca & Ruiz-Lozano 2009; Raaijmakers et al. 2009).

Therefore, understanding how plant roots select soil microbes to form the microbial community of the rhizosphere is an important scientific issue when considering plant growth and health, and this information may be useful to better exploit plant germplasm stemming from crop diversification (Den Herder et al. 2010).
A high number of studies have dealt with the diversity of the microbial community of the rhizosphere, especially in the case of cultivated plants (Kandeler et al. 2002; Smalla et al. 2001; Sun et al. 2008). Most cultivated plants are characterized by evolutionarily recent (i.e. within the last 12 000 years) events of domestication and man-driven selection (Purugganan & Fuller 2009). The latter have accompanied their dissemination to different regions of the world, leading to different species or subspecies according to local environmental

conditions of culture (reviewed by Salamini et al. 2002). This has resulted in morphological modifications that make the crops easier to harvest, especially increasing seed size. Maize arose from the domestication of a teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) in Mexico around 9000 years ago (Matsuoka et al. 2002; Doebley 2004). Dissemination and diversification of maize resulted in a wide range of maize genotypes, which were divided in five main genetic groups (Camus-Kulandaivelu et al. 2006). Most inbred lines within a group display similar agronomic properties (kernel texture, earliness), and often also a similar geographical origin (Dubreuil et al. 1996).
The Tropical group is rather large and close to the ancestral gene pool, as it includes the Mexican subgroup as well as the Caribbean and Andean subgroups that arose after early dissemination towards Caribbean islands and South America, respectively (CamusKulandaivelu et al. 2006). The Northern Flint group emerged in North America, after spreading of ancestral maize, and is quite different genetically from the other northern American groups (Doebley et al. 1986). The Corn Belt Dent group is a North American group that arose later, when European settlers crossed lines from Northern Flint group and tropical maize. The last northern American group (Stiff Stalk) was shaped by modern breeding during the second half of the twentieth century. The European Flint group resulted from hybridization of Tropical and Northern Flint populations following their importation in Europe and further selection process (Rebourg et al. 2003; Dubreuil et al. 2006). In the last century, the main change in maize breeding has been the development and use of hybrid cultivars (largely from European Flint and Corn Belt Dent landraces).
Genetic diversity may be quite extensive within a plant species (Mariette et al. 2001; Qian et al. 2006; Azizi et al. 2009). Cultivated varieties may differ in terms of root exudation (Czarnota et al. 2003), and since root exudation is a key factor shaping community assembly and structure (Grayston & Campbell 1996; Baudoin et al. 2003; Haichar et al. 2008), it was not surprising that plant cultivars differ in terms of root colonization by soil bacteria (Germida & Siciliano 2001; Adams & Kloepper 2002; van Overbeek & van Elsas 2008). In the case of maize, bacterial rhizosphere colonization of different genotypes has been assessed for seed inoculants (Garc ́ıa de Salomone & Do ̈bereiner 1996; Riggs et al. 2001; El Zemrany et al. 2006), particular taxonomic populations e.g. Paenibacillus spp. (Arau ́jo da Silva et al. 2003), functional groups e.g. culturable phloroglucinolproducing pseudomonads (Picard et al. 2004; Picard & Bosco 2006), as well as the entire community (Brusetti et al. 2005). The maize genotypes in these studies were
chosen for their phenotypic characteristics (e.g. root morphology) or agricultural importance, and cultivar comparisons were typically carried out without knowledge on the history of these plants. The only studies where maize genotypes were explicitly taken in consideration focused on the heterosis effect of hybrids (Picard et al. 2004; Picard & Bosco 2005) and transgenetic modifications (Brusetti et al. 2005).
The hypothesis in this study was that the evolutionary history of maize has shaped patterns of soil bacteria selection by individual maize lines. This means, at the level of the crop diversification process, that differences between rhizobacterial communities would increase with the genetic distance between lines. It also means, considering this time the outcome of the diversification process, that membership of individual lines to a particular genetic group of maize would be a significant factor determining their rhizobacterial community composition. On this basis, the objective of this work was to determine the relation between diversification of maize and the selection of soil bacteria in the rhizosphere. This issue was addressed by comparing 10 characterized inbred lines representing the five main groups of maize. The rhizobacterial community of seedlings was assessed using a 16S rRNA taxonomic microarray previously validated for soil and rhizosphere studies (Sanguin et al. 2006; Kyselkova ́ et al. 2009), and results were analysed by considering the genetic distance between maize inbred lines.
Materials and methods
Selection of maize genotypes
Inbred lines were obtained by self-pollination from American and European traditional maize landraces. Two inbred lines for each of the five groups of maize defined by Camus-Kulandaivelu et al. (2006) were selected from a collection of 393 inbred lines, as follows. To start with, inbred lines characteristic of a heterotic group and largely used for hybrid development were chosen (including genome-sequenced B73) based on analysis of neutral markers corresponding to simple sequence repeat (SSR) data at 67 noncoding loci (microsatellite analysis). Then, a sample of inbred lines maximizing the diversity from this first sample was selected using software Mstrat (Gouesnard et al. 2001). Finally, inbred lines having a high contribution to a group were chosen from this sample. For all groups, this could be achieved with a contribution threshold as high as 0.85 based on analysis with software STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000), which generates clusters based on both transient Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium and linkage disequilibrium caused by admixture between

populations. All seeds were obtained by J. Laborde (INRA, St Martin de Hinx).
Greenhouse experiment
The 10 inbred lines were cultivated in soil taken from the surface horizon of a field located at La Coˆte SaintAndre ́ near Lyon (France), which was cropped with maize for several years. The soil was a luvisol with a loamy surface horizon (clay 16.2%, silt 43.9%, sand 40.1%, organic matter 2.1%, pH(water) 7.0, N 1.4 g ⁄ kg) (El Zemrany et al. 2006). Soil was sieved (6 mm) and 2.5 kg used to fill 3-dm3 pots.
Seeds were surface-disinfected by soaking 10 min in 5% H2O2, followed with one rinse with sterile distilled water, one wash with 70% ethanol, and three rinses with sterile distilled water. For each maize genotype, five pots sown with three seeds (thinned to two seedlings on day 10) were used. Five nonplanted pots were also included. They were placed following a randomized block design in a greenhouse with 16 h of light (25 °C) and 8 h of darkness (18 °C). Water was adjusted to soil retention capacity using an automated irrigation system.
Sampling was carried out at 21 days after sowing. The root systems were dug up and shaken vigorously to separate soil loosely adhering to the roots. Each root system with closely adhering soil was transferred to a bottle containing 300 mL of sterile distilled water. The bottles were shaken manually for 1 min, then 15 min on a platform shaker (Innova 2100; New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA) at 180 rpm. The soil fraction (considered as rhizosphere sample) was recovered by centrifugation for 30 min at 4600 g and kept at )20 °C. The root systems were picked up and blotted dry.
Plant analysis included determination of seed weight (10 seeds per genotype), shoot height at 15 and 20 days, number of leaves at 10, 15 and 20 days, and fresh biomass of roots and shoots at 21 days (n = 5). Two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s tests were done to compare the effects of maize genetic groups and of individual maize lines (P < 0.05), using R software (http://www.r-project.org).
Microarray analysis of rhizosphere samples
Total DNA from 0.5 g of rhizosphere or nonplanted (control) soil was extracted using FastDNA spin kit for soil (Q-Biogene, Illkirch, France), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The universal primers T7-PA and PH (derived from Bruce et al. 1992) were used to obtain 1.5-kb amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene rrs from the total community (Edwards et al. 1989), as described by Kyselkova ́ et al. 2009).
PCR products were purified with a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France), accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and adjusted to 50 ng ⁄ lL. For fluorescent labelling, purified PCR products were converted to RNA by in vitro transcription, purified, fragmented, and hybridized as described by Sanguin et al. (2008).
The 1033 probes (described in Kyselkova ́ et al. 2009) were synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) with a 5¢ C6–NH2 modification and spotted, as described by Sanguin et al. (2008). Each probe was repeated four times per slide. Hybridization was performed in temperature-controlled Belly Dancer (Stovall Life Sciences, Greensboro, NC, USA), as described by Sanguin et al. (2008).
Analysis of microarray data
The slides were scanned at 532 nm with 10-lm resolution using a GeneTac LS IV scanner (GenomicSolutions, Huntingdon, UK), and images were analysed with GENEPIX 4.01 (Axon, Union City, CA, USA), as described (Sanguin et al. 2008). Spots of poor quality (presence of dust or hybridization signal saturation) were excluded from further analyses, as described (Sanguin et al. 2008). Data filtration was done using R 2.8.0 (http://www.r-project.org). Hybridization of a given spot was considered positive when 80% of the spot pixels had intensity higher than the median local background pixel intensity plus twice the standard deviation of the local background, as done previously (Sanguinetal.2008;Kyselkova ́etal.2009).Theintensity of the signal (median of signal minus background) was replaced by its square root, and the intensity of each spot was expressed as a fraction of the total intensity signal of the basic pattern it belongs to (Sanguin et al. 2006). A given probe was considered to be positive when at least three of the four spot replicates were hybridized.
Microarray data were treated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), based on the correlation matrix. Between-Group Analysis, which ordinates groups and then projects individual samples on the resulting axes (Dole ́dec & Chessel 1987; Culhane et al. 2002), was also performed, followed by Mantel tests (Mantel 1967) to examine relations between treatments. These analyses were done using the ADE4 package of R (Thioulouse et al. 1997). ANOVA and Fisher’s LSD tests (using DSAASTAT 1.0192 for Excel; Onofri, 2006) (P < 0.05) were used (i) to compare treatments along each of the first two PCA axes, i.e. based on PC1 coordinates as well as on PC2 coordinates, and (ii) for each probe to compare bulk soil versus rhizosphere (of each maize line, i.e. 10 comparisons). The comparison of the effects of maize groups and of individual lines on total rhizobacterial

community composition was also studied with 50–50 MANOVA (Langsrud 2002) at P < 0.05, using R software. Probes differing in intensity between the five groups (compared two by two) were identified with Mann– Whitney tests (P < 0.05).
Quantitative PCR
Relative amounts of rrs sequences of Burkholderia cepacia complex in maize genotypes was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), after development of a real-time protocol based on the forward primer QPCR-Bcep16s2F (Whitby et al. 2006) and the B. cepacia probe Burcep (Kyselkova ́ et al. 2009) as reverse primer. PCR reaction was carried out in 20 lL containing 4 lL of PCR grade water, 2lL of each primer (final concentration 0.75 lM), 10 lL of LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I master mix (Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France) and 60 pg of sample DNA (in triplicate for each of five plants per line). The cycling programme included a 10-min incubation at 95 °C, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 15s, 65°C for 15s and 72°C for 10 s. Amplification specificity was studied by melting curve analysis of the PCR products performed by ramping the temperature to 95 °C for 10 s and back to 65 °C for 15 s, followed by incremental increases of 0.1°C ⁄ s up to 95 °C. Melting curve calculation and determination of Tm values were performed using the polynomial algorithm function of LightCycler Software v.1 (Roche Applied Science).
Genomic DNA from Burkholderia cenocepacia LMG 16656 (which belongs to the B. cepacia complex) was used to generate standard curves, after dilution from 5 · 10)9 to 5 · 10)15 g DNA ⁄ lL (in triplicate). Sterile water was used as negative control. PCR efficiency was calculated from standard curves according to the equation E = 10()1 ⁄ slope). The five samples for each of the two inbred lines of groups Corn Belt Dent and Northern Flint (chosen because they were the most distant in rhizobacterial community PCA) were analysed. Results were expressed as ng of DNA from B. cepacia complex bacteria per lg of total soil DNA.
For cloning⁄sequencing, the quantitative PCR products described above were purified with the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and re-amplified, using the same primer set. PCR was done in 50 lL containing 1 lL DNA (approximately 50 ng), 5 lL 10· reaction buffer, 2.5 lL of each primer (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France), 5 lL dNTP, and 1 lL Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification was done in an Eppendorf Mastercycler with 5 min denaturation at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 25sat94°C,25sat57°Cand25sat72°C,andafinal elongation of 5 min at 72 °C. After purification, the PCR products were cloned (pGEMs-T Easy Vector System
kit; Promega, Charbonnieres, France) and 12 clones from each of the four lines studied were sequenced on both strands (CoGenics, Meylan, France). Sequences (EMBL accession numbers FR670611–FR670618) were checked and edited with BIOEDIT version 7.0.5.3 (http:// www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/BioEdit.html). Sequence affiliation was performed using BLASTN with default parameters at NCBI Blast (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/blast/Blast.cgi).
Comparison of genetic distance between maize inbred lines with rhizobacterial community molecular data
The microsatellite sequences obtained by CamusKulandaivelu et al. (2006) were used to compute genetic distances between maize inbred lines, based on a distance derived from Rogers (1972) hereafter termed modified distance of Rogers (MDR2). MDR2 was computed as follows (Rebourg et al. 2003):
1XL XAi 1
MDR2XY 1⁄4 L i1⁄41 j1⁄41 2ðPijX 􏰀 PijYÞ2
where L is the number of loci (here 67), Ai the number of alleles at the ith locus, and PijX and PijY are the frequencies of the jth allele at the ith locus for the lines X and Y. The mean inter-group genetic distance between the four lines of two genetic groups (i.e. each line being compared with the two lines from the other group; n = 4 comparisons in total) was used to estimate the genetic distance between these groups.
The Bray–Curtis distance (Bray & Curtis 1957) was used to compare rhizobacterial communities of different lines, using normalized hybridisation intensity data. When comparing maize groups, the mean inter-group Bray–Curtis distance (n = 4) between rhizobacterial communities of the four lines of two genetic groups was used. The comparison of the two types of matrices was assessed by Mantel (1967).
Results
Genetic comparison of maize groups
Inbred lines displaying a high contribution to their genetic group (meaning that their genetic make-up was representative of the group) and maximizing intragroup diversity were obtained. The contribution levels of the two lines to their group were just above the 0.85 threshold in the Tropical group, whereas they were higher than 0.92 in the Corn Belt Dent and Northern Flint groups and even 0.97 in the European Flint and Stiff Stalk groups (Table 1).

Line properties
Genetic contribution to the five genetic groups†
       *Each line name is followed by a term indicating collection origin (inra or usa).
†Values correspond to allelic frequency of membership to a group (i.e. proportion of alleles corresponding to the group). The genetic group to which each inbred line belongs is indicated in grey.
The genetic distance between the two inbred lines of a same group differed extensively according to the genetic group considered. The two closest inbred lines were those selected for the Stiff Stalk group (MDR2XY = 0.35), which results from recent breeding and has a narrow genetic base. A short distance (MDR2XY = 0.36) was also found with Northern Flint group. In contrast, the distance for the Tropical group was almost twice as high (MDR2XY = 0.60) and somewhat higher for the European Flint (MDR2XY = 0.67) and Corn Belt Dent (MDR2XY = 0.71) groups.
When all lines from the five maize groups were considered together, it appeared that the intra-group genetic distances between the two lines within groups Stiff Stalk and Northern Flint (but not within the three other groups Tropical, Corn Belt Dent and European Flint) were smaller than the inter-group distances, i.e. distances between lines from different groups (summarized in Fig. 1a and detailed in Fig. S1, Supporting information), which is fully compatible with the findings above. This is in accordance with PCA comparisons (based on 33% of data variability; Fig. S2, Supporting information). The mean genetic distance between lines of distinct groups ranged from about 0.65 (between European Flint and Tropical) to 0.75 (between European Flint and Stiff Stalk) (Fig. 1b).
16S Microarray analysis of the rhizosphere effect of seedlings
Among the 1033 probes, 162 hybridized with at least one bulk soil sample, vs. 165 (line EP1) to 187 (line Mo17) with at least one rhizosphere sample (giving 249 hybridized probes in at least one sample from any
line), and 151 probes hybridized with both one bulk soil sample (or more) and one rhizosphere sample (or more). Between-Group Analysis separated rhizosphere soil from bulk soil (not shown), which was confirmed by Mantel test. With PCA, the separation between rhizosphere and bulk soil was along the first axis (41% of the total variability; Fig. S3, Supporting information).
Among the 260 probes that hybridized with at least one bulk soil or rhizosphere sample, hybridization intensity with bulk soil was statistically lower for 24 probes and higher for 53 probes when compared with each of the 10 lines. The probes giving higher signals in these rhizosphere samples were especially those targeting the Betaproteobacteria genera Burkholderia, Herbaspirillum, Achromobacter, Neisseria and Variovorax, as well as the Gammaproteobacteria genus Pseudomonas, whereas those giving lower signals included noticeably probes for the order Clostridiales and genus Bacillus (both within Firmicutes), the Bacteroidetes order Flavobacteriales, the Alphaproteobacteria orders Rhizobiales and Rhodospirillales, the Deltaproteobacteria order Myxococcales, the Acidobacteria, the Planctomycetes, and the Actinobacteria (Fig. S3, Supporting information).

       Flint was intermediate (Fig. 2a). When microarray results were analysed directly (50–50 MANOVA), treatments differed again according to maize genetic groups, and the inbred lines within groups had also a significant effect. We repeated in a different soil the same experiment, with the lines from groups Northern Flint and Corn Belt Dent, and found again group differences in rhizobacterial community composition at 21 days (data not shown).
Hybridization results differed statistically (Mann– Whitney tests) between maize groups for 86 probes.
Discriminating probes with higher signals for the Corn Belt Dent group (with similar signals for both inbred lines) were especially those targeting Betaproteobacteria such as Herbaspirillum, Janthinobacterium and Variovorax, and especially the Burkholderia cepacia species complex (Fig. 2b). For the four genetic groups at the left side of the first PCA axis, the main observation was that probes for Alphaproteobacteria genera Azospirillum and Sphingomonas showed higher intensity with the Northern Flint group, and those for the Deltaproteobacteria genus Myxococcus and Betaproteobacteria genera Oxalobacter and Methylophilus with the Tropical and Stiff Stalk groups (Fig. 2b). Within each of these four maize groups, signal intensity for some of these probes varied significantly between the two lines.
Validation of selected microarray results by qPCR and sequencing
Validation of the main microarray results was sought after development of a real-time qPCR protocol for the species complex Burkholderia cepacia. qPCR displayed an efficiency of 100% and a low error level (3%). All 48 sequences obtained from qPCR products corresponded to the B. cepacia complex (Fig. S4, Supporting information), confirming primer specificity. They formed three groups, which clustered in the vicinity of species B. cepacia, B. seminalis, B. ambifaria, B. metallica, B. diffusa and B. arboris from the B. cepacia complex (Fig. S4, Supporting information). With the four inbred lines studied, a R2 value of 0.99 (P < 0.05) was found when comparing quantitative PCR and microarray hybridization data (Fig. 3), thereby validating the latter (and quantitative PCR data were statistically higher for Corn Belt Dent than Northern Flint based on ANOVA at P < 0.05).
Relation between maize diversity and rhizobacterial diversity based on distance analyses
No relationship was found overall when comparing the genetic distance between maize inbred lines (based on microsatellite plant neutral markers from Camus-Kulandaivelu et al. (2006)) with that between rhizobacterial communities (Fig. 1a and S1, Supporting information). Furthermore, the genetic distance between bacterial communities was not lower within maize genetic groups than in comparisons across different maize genetic groups, i.e. bacterial communities selected by maize lines of a same genetic group were often more distant than those selected by maize lines from different groups. This was even the case when considering the two homogenous groups Stiff Stalk and Northern Flint. No significant correlation (at P < 0.05) was found either

seeds, local pedoclimatic and farming conditions, and selection by farmers or breeders (Doebley 2004; Purugganan & Fuller 2009). One consequence is that genotypes selected in particular locations may be readily disseminated to other regions of the world, leading to more cosmopolitan distributions and influencing diversification further. In the case of crops like maize, this has several important implications. First, lines emblem-

                                       Fig. 3 Comparison of microarray hybridization level (expressed as relative fluorescence intensity for 400 ng of total rhizosphere DNA) and qPCR data (expressed as ng of DNA per 400 ng of total rhizosphere DNA) for bacteria of the Burkholderia cepacia complex in samples from the Corn Belt and Northern Flint groups. Each point is the mean for the two lines studied (each investigated with five plant replicates). The equation of the linear regression between the two datasets is shown.
                        atic of a given genetic group may be found in other regions, where lines from other group(s) are prevalent. Here for instance, lines FV252 (Corn Belt Dent group) originated from France, EM1433 (Tropical group) from Spain, and FV4 (Northern Flint) from France (Table 1).
Second, man-driven dissemination of seeds favours hybridization ⁄ recombination events, which may blur neutral genetic differences between genetic groups. Here, the Northern Flint and Stiff Stalk groups appeared well differentiated compared with the other groups, in accordance with Camus-Kulandaivelu et al. (2006). The three other groups were larger, as found by Vigouroux et al. (2008), to the point that certain genetic distances across groups were not longer that distances within genetic groups (Fig. 1a). The European Flint group includes germplasm from several European regions ⁄ countries, so its genetic base is quite broad, and the two inbred lines FV2 and EP1 belong to distant clusters within the group (Dubreuil et al. 1996). The Corn Belt Dent is also quite diverse (Labate et al. 2003); its representatives Mo17 and Fv252 differed in flowering earliness (Table 1) and belonged to distinct RFLP subgroups (Dubreuil et al. 1996).
Third, a wide range of maize genotypes, originating from all parts of America, have been imported in the last hundred years to Europe (Rebourg et al. 2003; Dubreuil et al. 2006), where the European Flint group formed (mainly from Tropical and Northern Flint populations). This process has continued in more recent times, but in a context of hybrid development. Therefore, soil microorganisms in Europe may be exposed to a rather large range of maize genotypes, and thus it was ecologically relevant to compare lines from all maize genetic groups in a same European soil. Indeed
differences in rhizobacterial community composition of seedlings were found between these maize lines as well as between the genetic groups they belong to.
The current 16S microarray data revealed a clear rhizosphere effect of maize seedlings on soil bacterial community composition (Fig. S3, Supporting information). Despite the selection pressure exerted by roots on soil bacteria (Berg & Smalla 2009; Raaijmakers et al. 2009), the number of probes hybridized was not lower in the rhizosphere, probably because the proportion of taxa numerically minor (and eluding microarray detection) is higher in bulk soil (Gomes et al. 2001). Although selection of B. cepacia complex (Balandreau et al. 2001; Salles et al. 2006) and counter-selection of Myxococcales (Haichar et al. 2008) by roots confirmed previous findings, the lower prevalence of the Alphaproteobacteria orders Rhizobiales and Rhodospirales on roots was not expected. Indeed, many Rhizobiaceae genera ⁄ species were found to be in higher proportion in the maize rhizosphere than in bulk soil in previous studies (Gomes et al. 2001; Sanguin et al. 2006; Haichar et al. 2008), but experiments were done with different soil type and ⁄ or maize phenology (Baudoin et al. 2009). In addition, this study showed the possibility (Jung et al. 2007) that the typically endophytic bacterium Herbaspirillum (Olivares et al. 1996) could establish in the rhizosphere. More importantly, here the rhizosphere effect of maize seedlings was documented at the scale of the genetic diversity of this plant species, unlike in previous work focusing on a single or a few closely-related genotypes only (Gomes et al. 2001; Sanguin et al. 2006). In this context, the mean Bray–Curtis similarity distance between bulk soil and rhizobacterial communities varied between 0.35 (European Flint) and 0.41 (Corn Belt Dent), whereas that between rhizobacterial communities of different maize groups varied between 0.07 and 0.14. This means that most of the rhizosphere effect was common to the five genetic groups, despite the extent of maize diversification events (Camus-Kulandaivelu et al. 2006). It also means that maize monoculture (20 years) was unlikely to have significantly enriched bacterial taxa more specific of certain maize genetic groups.
Even though of lesser extent, differences were also found when comparing rhizobacterial community composition between the five genetic groups of maize. There were mostly variations in signal intensities rather than in the range of hybridized probes, suggesting differences in taxa abundance, as confirmed by qPCR for the B. cepacia complex. These bacteria, which have a wide ecological role in soil (Parke & Gurian-Sherman 2001), display high species diversity in the soil of the study (Viallard et al. 1998; Balandreau et al. 2001). Some of the clones from the B. cepacia complex recovered in the current study clustered with established

species, whereas three others (cluster W85 3 ⁄ 7 ⁄ 12) did not and may represent a novel species (Fig. S4, Supporting information). Root isolates of B. cepacia differed between three maize cultivars (Dalmastri et al. 1999), but these cultivars were not characterized genetically. Here, the B. cepacia complex contributed along with other Betaproteobacteria to the particularity of Corn Belt Dent group. In this regard, it could be unexpected to find such a distinction in rhizobacterial community composition between Corn Belt Dent and the two other northern American groups, since all three formed in the same region of the world. Furthermore, a distinction between the Tropical group and the four temperate groups was not found, even when considering PCA axis 3 (not shown), despite soil type and climatic differences in both parts of the world.
The Tropical group is the closer to the ancestral maize genetic pool, which means that part of its genetic make-up is also found in the four other groups (Camus-Kulandaivelu et al. 2006), and this might account for its (unexpected) rather central position when comparing rhizobacterial communities (Fig. 2). The position of the European Flint group between Tropical and Northern Flint groups in rhizobacterial community comparisons is consistent with the fact that it formed by hybridization of these two groups (Rebourg et al. 2003; Dubreuil et al. 2006). Similarly, the position of the Stiff Stalk rhizobacterial community between those of the two other American groups Corn Belt Dent and Northern Flint is in accordance with the formation of Stiff Stalk group by modern breeding in the USA. Thus, on one hand, the formation of the five Z. mays genetic groups, which is an outcome of the crop diversification process, was a significant factor determining soil bacteria selection by seedlings and, in turn, rhizobacterial community composition. This is in accordance with the facts that (i) SSR microsatellite makers are relevant to delineate genetic structures within Poaceae species (Figliuolo & Perrino 2004) including maize (Dubreuil et al. 2006), and (ii) key plant traits such as flowering time fluctuate according to maize population structure (Camus-Kulandaivelu et al. 2006). Indeed, lines from groups Corn Belt Dent and Stiff Stalk displayed higher root biomass (Table S1, Supporting information), which may mean higher amounts of rhizodeposits (Benizri et al. 2002; Wichern et al. 2008) for root-colonizing bacteria. Qualitative differences in rhizodeposit composition (Czarnota et al. 2003) and other rhizosphere properties (Miyasaka et al. 1989) may also be expected and could explain differences in rhizobacterial community composition between groups (Haichar et al. 2008; Bressan et al. 2009).
On the other hand, the crop diversification process itself was not a significant factor determining rhizobac-
terial community composition, since the differences between rhizobacterial communities did not relate to the genetic distances (derived from microsatellite plant neutral markers i.e. noncoding SSR data) between maize groups or lines. Perhaps post-domestication diversification process was too short (estimated as only 9000 years for maize; Doebley 2004) for such an effect to materialize. Indeed, our results suggest that this genetic distance was not representative of the phenotypic differences important for selection of bacteria by seedling roots when considering recent (i.e. post-domestication) diversification of maize. Accordingly, no significant correlation was found when comparing pairwise differences in shoot and ⁄ or root biomass with genetic distances between maize lines (or with Bray–Curtis similarity distances between associated rhizobacterial communities) (not shown). A significant correlation was found between SSR-based genetic distance and maize morphological and yield markers by Heckenberger et al. (2005), but traits were assessed for mature plants and not seedlings. Therefore, it could also be that our lack of correlations was due to our focus on seedlings, as both (i) the relationship between plant genetic distance and plant phenotypic properties (Coque et al. 2006) and (ii) rhizobacterial community genetic structure (Baudoin et al. 2009) depend on maize phenology.
In conclusion, the genetic structure of maize resulting from crop diversification (giving five main groups) but not the extent of diversification in itself (determining maize genetic distances) influenced selection of soil bacteria by maize seedlings.
