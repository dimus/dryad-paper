For many applications in population genetics, codominant 
simple sequence repeats (SSRs) may have substantial 
advantages over dominant anonymous markers such as 
amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). In high 
polyploids, however, allele dosage of SSRs cannot easily be 
determined and alleles are not easily attributable to 
potentially diploidized loci. Here, we argue that SSRs may 
nonetheless be better than AFLPs for polyploid taxa if they 
are analyzed as effectively dominant markers because they 
are more reliable and more precise. We describe the 
transfer of SSRs developed for diploid Mercuriolis huetii to 
the clonal dioecious M. perennis. Primers were tested on 
a set of 54 male and female plants from natural decaploid 
populations. Eight of 65 tested loci produced polymorphic 
fragments. Binary profiles from 4 different scoring routines 
were used to define multi locus lineages (MLLs). Allowing for 
fragment differences within I MLL, all analyses revealed the 
same 14 MLLs without conflicting with merigenet, sex, or 
plot assignment. For semiautomatic scoring, a combination 
of as few as 2 of the 4 most polymorphic loci resulted in 
unambiguous discrimination of clones. Our study demonstrates 
that microsatellite fingerprinting of polyploid plants is 
a cost efficient and reliable alternative to AFLPs, not least 
because fewer loci are required than for diploids. 

Key words: genotyplng errors, lOCI characterization, 
microsateilites, polyploidy, SSR markers 

Over the last decade, genotyping with highly polymorphic 
DNA markers has become an increasingly important 
tool in plant ecology, with microsatellites (for review, 

see Selkoe and Toonen 20(6) and amplified fragment 
length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting (Mueller and 
Wolfenbarger 1999) being the current tools of choice. Both 
these techniques generate highly polymorphic profiles that 
are ideally suited for identifying distinct genetic individuals 
(genets), including clonal offspring. Whereas AFLPs utilize 
anonymous markers that can principally be used in all taxa 
and genomes, microsatellite analyses need specific primers 
for amplification of the regions with the respective simple 
sequence repeats (SSRs). The initial development of these 
primers is rather cost and time consuming, although genomic 
maps available for a growing number of taxa allow for an 
easier scanning for SSR loci (e.g., Temnykh et a1. 2001; 
Morgante et al. 2002; Tuskan et aL 20(4). In cases where 
primers have been developed for related taxa, crossamplification 
can be attempted, and there are now numerous 
studies reporting successful interspecific transferability of 
SSR primers (Peakall et aL 1998; Fraser et al. 2005; Gao et al. 
2005; Ducarme et al. 2008; Eusemann et al. 20(9). Generally, 
such attempts are the most successful for closely related 
species (76% transferability within the same genus and 90% 
within subgenera), although even then the amplifying loci are 
not always polymorphic (Rossetto 20(1). 

Whereas both AFLPs and microsatellites can be used to 
study genetic diversity and structure, microsatellites have the 
distinct advantage for the study of diploid organisms 
because of their codominant expression, which allows an 
exact identification of genotypes. Unfortunately, many of 
the advantages of codominance are lost in the study of 
polyploids, even those with disomic inheritance, because the 


Journal of Heredity 20 I I: I 02(4) 

allele dosage behind a specific peak can hardly be 
determined. As a result, SSR pro@es of polyploid taxa are 
most commonly interpreted in terms of "allele phenotypes" 
(Esselink ct al. 2(04), and peak patterns are usually coded as 
dominant data (Gerber et a1. 2000; Andreakis et at 20(9) 
largely comparable to anonymous markers like AFLPs or 
random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). For lower 
polyploids like tetraploids, it may sometimes be possible to 
determine allelic configurations (Landergott et a1. 2006; 
Wirth et al. 2(09), for example, by using specific techniques 
like micro satellite DNA allele counting-peak ratios (Esselink 
et aL 2004; Nybom et al. 20(4) or other mathematical 
methods (Bruvo et al. 2004; MarkVv'ith et al. 20(6), but this is 
usually not possible for higher ploidy levels. Nevertheless, 
polyploids may offer an important redeeming feature for 
population genetic analysis using microsatellites if their 
interpretation as dominant markers can be tolerated: Their 
SSR pro@es are typically much more diverse, a fact that 
allows for fingerprinting with fewer markers, even if only 
allele phenorypes can be recognized. 

Generally, the maximum number of possible genotypes 
(gt) in codominant microsatellite markers can be calculated 
through the formula that describes the number of 

k-combination with repetitions: gt= ( ~+k-l); in our case, 
the number of elements (n alleles) equals the number of 
chosen elements (k chromosomes accommodating these 
alleles); hence, gt=i~:=~l!!, with n denoting both the ploidy 
level of the organism and the maximum number ofdifferent 
alleles at a locus in a single organism (excluding null alleles). 
Due to the difficulty (or impossibility) of distinguishing 
genotypes with the same alleles but in different allele 
dosages, only a lower number of distinct allele phenotypes 
(pt) can be readily discerned by their SSR pro@es. When 
totally ignoring allele dosage (i.e., only noting presence or 
absence of alleles), a comparison of the number of all 
possible genotypes for different ploidy levels revealed a rule 

2n

that can be described by the formula pt = -1. Whereas 
for a diploid species, we thus obtain gt = pt = 3, for 
a tetraploid taxon, 35 possible genotypes will generate only 
15 different allele phenotypes (for different phenorypic 
classes and inheritance patterns, see De Silva ct al. 20(5); for 
a decaploid, these numbers increase to 92 378 and 1023, 
respectively. Therefore, for highly polyploid species, allele 
phenorypes can generate a high diversity if an SSR locus is 
sufficiently polymorphic. Moreover, the amount of polymorphism 
is expected to be higher in polyploids because of 
the greater effective population size. 

Another challenge presented by the SSR profiles of 
polyploid taxa concerns the difficulty of unambiguously 
identifying alleles (e.g., in the presence of stutter peaks). 
This issue renders it essential to rate the quality of the 
fingerprinting, that is, to assess the reproducibility of the 
profiles and to calculate error rates. Even in diploids, quality 
evaluation can be important but is often not reported 
(Hoffman and Amos 2(05). For clonally growing plants, 
spatial position and sometimes also sexes or flowering 
morphs can be used as context information to recognize 

480 

errors in identifying genetically distinct individuals, as 
demonstrated by Scbnittler and Eusemann (2010) for the 
dioecious diploid Populus euphratica. Conflicts with this 
context information often indicate insufficient resolution 
of the marker system (compare Arnaud-Haond et a1. 2005), 
that is, by wrongly merging similar but distinct genotypes 
into one multilocus genorype (MLG) (merging error, 
Schnittler and Eusemann 2(10). High-resolution systems 
involving many loci reveal the opposite problem, that is, 
splitting a single genotype into 2 apparent MLGs. Unfortunately, 
such splitting errors are much more common 
because for a multilocus system, even a moderate per-locus 
error rate translates to a significant rate of per-sample errors, 
with most of them expressed as splitting errors. To 
compensate for this error, one or more deviating alleles 
may be allowed for MLG identity; we thus effectively deal 
with multilocus lineages (MLLs) as surrogates for genets. 
With the more frequent interference of stutter and allele 
peaks for SSR fingerprints from polyploid plants, the right 
choice of this threshold becomes especially important. 

Here, we demonstrate the use of SSR analyses for the 
fingerprinting of individuals of the clonal decaploid 
Mercurialis perennis L. (Euphorbiaceae), after their development 
from cross-amplification of markers originally developed 
for the related species M. annua and M. huetii 
(Korbecka et al. 2010). In particular, we 1) develop a specific 
scoring routine for polyploid SSR in M. perennis, 2) 
determine the level of polymorphism at individual loci and 
assess their resolution, and 3) validate the resulting allele 
phenotypes and MLLs by comparison with context data 
(sex, merigenet, and spatial position) to evaluate error rates 
and reliability of the data set. In previous attempts to 
distinguish genets of M. perennis on the basis of AFLP 
fingerprinting (Vandepitte et a1. 2009, 2010), the genetic 
patterns obtained were not correlated with morphological 
data such as sex or merigenet relations. Our study thus 
provides an important case in point, where as few as 2 SSR 
loci appear to be superior to broadscale AFLP pro@es in 
distinguishing different MLLs. 

Materials and Methods 

Mercurialis perennis L. (Euphorbiaceae) is a dioecious forest 
herb with stable sex expression (compare Jefferson 2(08). 
The species grows clonally, with branched subterranean 
stoloniferous spacers connecting the aboveground shoots 
(modules). Decay of these spacers splits genetic individuals 
into independent merigenets (for terminology, see Pfeiffer 
2005). Cytorypes with different ploidy levels are reported 
throughout the distribution range (Krahenbuhl and Kupfer 
1995). The population examined in this study is most 
probably decaploid; 2C values of 2 samples measured by 
flow cytometry are comparable to those for decaploids 
recorded by Vandcpitte et ai. (2009; compare also 
Krahenbuhl and Kupfer 1995). 

For the initial screening, 6 M perennis samples from 
different German and 1 Polish population were used. The 
final analysis included 52 leaf samples from three 1 x 1 m2 


plots collected in the Elisenhain forest (nature 
reserve "Eldena'') near Greifswald (Mecklenburg-Western 
Pomerania, 54°05'N, 13°27'E). As an out-group, 2 specimens 
from P6lchow (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, ca. 
85 km away) and Glashutte (Brandenburg, ca. 230 km away) 
were included. In the Elisenhain plots, all plants were 
carefully excavated to obtain information about connections 
between modules. As context information, we recorded the 
spatial position of the samples within 1 of 3 plots A, B, or D 
(distance between plots was at least 200 m); merigenet 
identity (which modules were connected morphologically); 
and sex (male, female, or nonflowering modules and 
merigenets). With 21 merigenets comprising up to 4 
connected modules analyzed, most (50 of 54 samples) 
functioned as natural replicates, allowing us to estimate the 
error rate in discriminating between genets. 

DNA was extracted from air-dried leaf material (30-40 
mg). First, we used a standard Cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB) protocol (Doyle JJ and Doyle JL 1990 with 
small alterations), and for final analyses, we used the 
Invisorb Spin Food Kit II (Invitek). DNA extraction 
followed the manufacturer's protocol, with a few exceptions: 
instead of lysis buffer P, 1 ml prewarmed (60°C) 2 x 
CTAB buffer was used; RNA digestion time was extended 
to 30-45 min at 37°C; and final centrifugation in the second 
washing step lasted 5 min. Elution of DNA was carried out 
in 2 steps using 50 and 25 fll prewarmed elution buffer D. 
The DNA content of each sample was estimated in 
a spectrometer (BioMate3, Thermo Spectronic). 

We used primer pairs designed by Korbecka et al. (2010) 
based on their M. huetii SSR library. As M perennis is only 
distantly related to M. huetii (Kdhenblihl et aL 2002; Obbard 
et at 2(06), we chose to test 65 out of 73 available primer 
pairs that had amplified successfully in M. huetii plus at least 
some lineages of M. annua in the cross-amplification tests 
carried out by Korbecka et al. (2010). We assumed that these 
primers were most likely to amplify M perennis as well. We 
screened for amplification in M. perennis using M. huetii DNA 
as positive control. The PCRs contained 10-20 ng DNA 
template, 0.2 flM of each forward (F) and reverse (R) 
primers, 1 x reaction buffer supplied with polymerase 
(Applichem) with 2.5 mM MgClz, 0.2 mM dNTP mix 
(Peqlab), 0.25 flg bovine serum albumin (New England 
Biolabs), 0.45 U Taq-Polymerase (Applichem), and ddHzO 
in 10 fll final volume. The loci were amplified in 
a thermocycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler) using the following 
cycle pro@e: 3 min at 94°C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 
30 s at 55°C, and 45 s at 72 °C and an additional 20 min at 
72°C and cooling to 4 0c. PCR products were screened for 
bands after electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels stained with 
ethidium bromide. 

PCRs of loci that produced no PCR bands or that 
differed in size by more than -100 nt from the ones in 

M. huetii were repeated at least once. Successfully amplified 
loci with products of roughly the expected lengths were 
tested further. For these tests, fluorescently labeled forward 
primers were used with the same reaction mix (see above) 
and the following step-down cycle protocol: initial 3 min at 
Bnef Communications 

94°C, followed by 20 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 
locus-specific annealing temperature (7;.; Table 2), and 
45 s at 72 °C and another 10 cycles of 30 sat 89°C, 30 s at 
7;.-5°C, and 45 s at 72 °C, followed by 20 min at 72 °C 
before cooling down to 4 0c. PCR products were checked 
in agarose gels and diluted depending on band quality (2.5to 
10-fold). One microliter of the dilution was mixed with 

8.85 fll HiDi formamide and 0.15 fll GeneScan 500 ROX 
size standard (Applied Biosystems), denatured for 5 min at 
95°C, and cooled down before screening the samples in an 
ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer for length polymorphisms. 
For the final analysis, 8 polymorphic loci were tested on 54 
samples of M. perennis. Products from singleplex PCRs were 
pooled for simultaneous runs of 4 loci per sample. 
To analyze SSR loci in a highly polyploid taxon, a suitable 
analysis routine had to be developed, including a check for 
reliability in distinguishing genets. Sample pro@es were scored 
blindly in random order using GeneMapper v3.7 (Applied 
Biosystems). Three different peak-scoring routines were 
applied, a mainly automatic scoring (further referred to as 
AUTO), a semiautomatic (SEMI), and a manual routine 
(MANUAL), aiming at discerning different peak types. For all 
routines, the same bin sets were applied, and independent 
binary pro@es were generated for each locus, coding presence 

(1) and absence of peaks (0). The matrices for 8 individual loci 
were combined for further analyses (multilocus approach). 
For AUTO, the scoring was carried out using default 
settings but allowing a maximum of 10 alleles per locus 
(corresponding to the maximum number of alleles in 
a decaploid). In rare cases, we manually corrected for 
minimal peak shifts and deleted pull-up peaks from other 
loci. For the SEMI scoring, we manually added to AUTO 
profiles 1) post-peaks directly following scored peaks and

number of different fragments scored (Nf), and mean numbers and ranges of scored fragments per individual (~) using the SEMI scoring routine in 
a sample of 52 plants from 1 decaploid population. SD, standard deviation; n.d, not determined. 

a Exact repeat motif could not be determined. 

reaching at least 10% of their height, 2) peaks (~50 rfu) not 
identified in the AUTO mode, and 3) peaks of very similar 
height to adjacent scored ones. Small peaks between 
neighboring large peaks were only scored if they were 
clearly recognized as post-peaks of the first peak. In the 
MANUAL setting, each peak in the electropherograms was 
scored manually and given peak quality scores ranging from 
1 to 10 (fable 1). These scores were applied in descending 
order with declining putative peak quality, that is, with 
higher scores for presumable post-peaks (because stutter 
bands usually occur before main peaks) and lower scores for 
obvious stutter (see Table 1, Figure 1). For data analyses, 
these peak scores were translated into different binary 
matrices, applying a peak quality threshold to exclude all 
peaks with lower scores. (Example: Using a peak quality 
threshold of 8, all peaks with scores of 8-10 were coded as 
present in a scoring routine called MANUAL 8.) 

To differentiate allele phenotypes (in the following, we 
refer to these as SSR phenotypes because the allelic nature 
of peaks was not verified) and to check for conflict with 
context information, we modified the Excel routine 
described in Schnittler and Eusemann (2010). Basic 
functions of this routine are comparable with those of the 
program GenClone (Arnaud-Haond and Belkhir 20(7). 
However, we applied a variable allowance of 0, 1, 2, ... 
deviating peaks for the identity of SSR phenotypes, thus 
effectively defining MLLs (Arnaud-Haond et al. 2(07). For 
values greater than zero, we defined all SSR phenotypes that 
differed from at least one other SSR phenotype by a number 
of peaks below the respective threshold as 1 MLL (clone), 
even if 2 members of this MLL differed by a number of 

482 

peaks above the threshold. This routine enabled us to test 
variable allowances of tolerated fragment differences and to 
compare with frequency histograms of pairwise genetic 
distances between samples (as presented in Douhovnikoff 
and Dodd 2003). The binary matrices for AUTO, SEMI, 
and for selected peak score thresholds of MANUAL were 
further analyzed in PAUP 4.0b (Swofford 2(02), calculating 
neighbor joining and unweighted pair group method with 
arithmetic mean dendrograms and implying bootstrap 
searches with each 100 000 replicates. 

To assess the resolution of our system with different 
scoring routines, we calculated locus accumulation curves by 
selecting all combinations C~ from the 1= 8 available loci with 
1 :::; n :::; 8 as in the respective routine in GenClone but 
additionally monitored conflicts with context information. If 
the obtained curves leveled off and did not result in conflicts, 
the resolution ofthe marker system seemed to be sufficient for 
genet discrimination using the respective data set (Schnittler 
and Eusemann 2(10). Conflicts with context information 
include 1) assigning samples of1 merigenet to different MLLs, 
2) recording the same MLL in different plots, or 3) having 
shoots ofopposite sex in 1 MLL. The first problem represents 
a splitting error and the latter 2 are merging errors in the 
sense of Schnittler and Eusemann (2010). 

Using DNA sequencing, microsatellite regions in M 
perennis were examined to compare them with M. huetii SSR 
library clones. For each of the 8 loci used in the analysis, 2 
PCR products (1 male and 1 female sample) with low peak 
numbers were used as a template. Sequencing reactions 
further contained the BigDye 1.1 terminator kit, sequencing 
buffer (both Applied Biosystems), and unlabeled primer.

to the manufacturer's protocol but with an additional

a Genetic Analyzer 3130xl (Applied Biosystems); the 
resulting sequences were checked manually for the presence 
of microsatellite motifs. For most loci, only one primer was 
used in the sequencing reaction; in cases of ambiguity, both 
forward and reverse sequences were checked. 

Results and Discussion 

Cross-amplification of SSR markers from M. huetii in M. 
perennis was successful in 12 of the 65 loci tested. Eight loci 
were polymorphic and suitable for distinguishing genets: 
Mh01, Mh35-2, Mh57, Mh61, Mh72, Mh80, Mh81, and Mh83. 
Of these, only Mh35-2 has been characterized before 
(Korbecka et al. 2010). These 8 loci were used to assign 
54 samples to MLLs. The lengths of PCR products of the 
individual loci in M. per ennis correspond fairly well to their 
respective lengths in M. huetii Cfable 2). 

The sequencing revealed identity of simple repeat motifs 
between M. huetii and M. perennis in Mh72, Mh80, Mh81, and 
Mh83 Crable 2). In Mh57, the 2 sequenced M. perennis 
samples showed a slightly altered motif [(CA)n (GA)n repeat] 
but no consequences for the dinucleotide repeat structure. 
Even the complex motif ofMh35-2 in M. huetii and M. annua 
(Korbecka et al. 2010) was present in M. per ennis with slight 

alterations (fable 2), highlighting the interspecific transferability 
of the SSR loci. For these loci, observed small 
(±1 nt) differences in fragment lengths in some samples 
most probably indicate single nucleotide indels in the 
different SSR copies, resulting in fragment lengths departing 
from typical repeat distances but not affecting the motifitself. 
Korbecka et al. (2010) also detected such small differences in 
the allele lengths for loci originating from the same SSR 
library and attributed this length variation to mononucleotide 
runs detected in the sequence next to the microsatellite 
region. Because most sequenced loci in M. perennis also 
showed short mononucleotide repeats (especially poly-A and 
T), this might explain the observed length differences. 

For only 2 loci, Mh01 and Mh61, the repeat motifs 
remain ambiguous because of difficulties in sequencing the 
microsatellite region. This might be due to interference of 
different products (i.e., additional primer binding site) or of 
a second micro satellite (in Mh01, a shorter AG repeat is 
present in M. huetii as well as in M. perennis). 

Out of the 4 scoring routines compared, that is, AUTO, 
SEMI, MANUAL 8, and MANUAL 4, AUTO resulted in the 
lowest mean fragment numbers scored for all loci (24.5 ± 2.9), 
whereas the highest numbers were obtained for SEMI and 
MANUAL 4 (36.5 ± 3.6 and 38.7 ± 4.0, respectively). The 
least polymorphic were loci Mh01, Mh72, and Mh81, showing 
lowest minima as well as lowest mean numbers of fragments 
per sample. The loci Mh35-2, Mh57, and Mh80 performed best 
(Table 2, see also Supplementary Material, Supplement 1). 

Peak scoring and the generated binary pro@es proved to 
be rather constant for modules of the same merigenet 
(natural replicates), different runs, and independent PCR

products (data not shown) but also for different scoring 
routines. Genet discrimination is highly reliable: The same 
14 MLLs are identified with all 3 scoring routines and as 
clusters with (nearly) maximum bootstrap support (~94100%) 
in the dendrograms (compare Figure 2). The 2 
samples from outlier populations Glashiitte and P6lchow 
are readily differentiated as distinct, singular genets. The 52 
modules (2 singular samples and 21 merigenets with each 24 
analyzed modules) from the Elisenhain belong to 12 clonal 
MLLs, each comprising 2-11 samples from 1 to 4 
independent merigenets (Figure 2.). 

484 

In all scoring routines, these 14 MLLs were obtained 
without conflicts with context information over a broad 
range of tolerated fragment differences (Figure 3). SEMI, 
MANUAL 7, and MANUAL 8 seem to be the best scoring 
routines because, in order to avoid splitting errors, only 4 
fragment differences within 1 MLL have to be allowed. 
A higher allowance is required for AUTO and other 
MANUAL routines (Figure 3). These values are additionally 
verified by the frequency histograms of pairwise comparisons 
between samples, which showed bimodal distributions 
with pronounced minima (data not shown).

If fewer fragment differences are allowed within 1 MLL, 
splitting errors occur, artificially augmenting the number of 
genets. They can be reliably detected as they assign modules 
from 1 merigenet to different MLLs (merigenet conflict). In 
contrast, very high allowances for fragment differences reduce 
the resolution ofthe system and introduce merging errors that 
wrongfully reduce the number of MLLs. Merging errors can 
only be seen by conflicts with plot and/or sex assignment and 
thus can go undetected in cases where the 2 merged genets 1) 
belong to the same plot (probability ~ 0.33 for 3 plots) or 2) 
belong to the same sex (P ~ 0.5). With unequal numbers of 
samples between plots, biased sex ratios, or a significant 
proportion of nonflowering plants (of unknown sex), these 
probabilities increase further (Schnittler and Eusemann 2(10). 
To minimize these problems, we included in our study mostly 
flowering modules from 3 different plots, which should be of 
different origin due to the limited colonization capacity of 

M. perennis (c£ Jefferson 20(8). 
For genotyping in diploid taxa, most often 8-12 loci are 
required for reasonable precision (Arnaud-I-Iaond et aL 
2005; Eusemann et al. 2009; see also Koskinen et aL 20(4). 
Usually a system with fewer loci lacks resolution, indicated 
by merging errors (Arnaud-l-Iaond et al. 2005; Schnittler and 
Eusemann 2010). However, with more loci, the error rate in 
distinguishing genets increases in a nearly linear fashion due 
to multiplication of genotyping errors at single loci (Hoffman 
and Amos 20(5). Due to the larger number of alleles 

per locus, the discriminative power of a locus is potentially 
higher for polyploids than for diploids, even when only 
allele phenotypes can be differentiated (allowing up to 1023 
possible phenotypes in a decaploid compared with only 3 
genotypes in a diploid organism). Successful fingerprinting 
of polyploids with a high level ofprecision will thus typically 
require substantially fewer loci than equivalent diploids. Our 
study of decaploid M. perennis bears this out. 

To assess the resolution of the marker system adopted 
here, locus accumulation curves were generated. Figure 
4A,13 shows the results for the AUTO and SEMI scoring 
routines, allowing 7 and 4 fragment differences within 1 
MLL, respectively. For the latter scoring mode, any 
combination of 5 loci, irrespective of individual degree of 
polymorphism, results in unambiguous assignment to 
MLLs. The same was the case for all but one of the 
combinations of 4 loci and even for 6 combinations of 
only 2 loci (including Mh35-2, Mh57, Mh80, and Mh83; see 
upper dotted line in Figure 413). In the AUTO scoring 
mode, the values were not as good: only the 3 most 
polymorphic loci together (Mh35-2, Mh57, and Mh80) 
allowed for reliable discrimination of clones; in most 
cases, the maximum number of discerned MLLs was 
reached only by combinations of all 8 loci. Figure 4C,D 
shows the corresponding curves for mean conflicts per 
sample, which decreases slower for AUTO than for SEMI 
routine.

Figure 4. Locus accumulation curve for the AUTO (A) and SEMI scoring mode (B), applying thresholds of 7 and 4 different 
fragments for MLL identity, respectively. Shown are (A, B) mean numbers of differentiated MLLs with standard deviations (solid 
lines) and combinations ofloci performing best and poorest (upper and lower dotted lines, respectively) and the resulting mean sex 

(C) and plot (D) conflicts per sample for AUTO (triangles) and SEMI (circles) routine, with standard deviations in solid and dotted 
lines, respectively. 
Given the high reliability and discriminative power 
obtained with the SEMI routine, we strongly recommend 
this scoring method; it provides high performance with little 
additional effort. In contrast to the MANUAL scoring, 
SEMI does not require further laborious differentiation of 
peak types. Compared with the fully automatic method 
(AUTO), the addition of post-peaks in particular adds much 
information. However, including a higher number of loci 
and a somewhat higher allowance of fragment differences 
for MLL identity, a fully automated scoring routine yields 
the same results. Two (SEMI) or 3 (AUTO) of the most 
polymorphic markers are sufficient for unambiguous 
recognition of clones and clonal replicates in our study 
(Figure 4A,B). In the combined analysis of all 8 loci, 
however, the optimum constellation (14 MLLs, no conflicts) 
is more robust in SEMI (and MANUAL) than in AUTO, 
and fewer fragment differences have to be tolerated for 
MLL identity (Figure 

Of course, the codominant state of microsatellite loci 
loses its utility in higher polyploids, as the dosage of 
individual alleles can usually not be determined (see in the 
Introduction). Furthermore, the discrimination of low-copy 
alleles is often hampered by stuttering. As long as stutter 
peaks are reproducible, they do not diminish the feasibility 
of SSR for the purposes of distinguishing genets. Due to 
these features, SSRs for polyploid organisms are a partially 
anonymous marker system that may be substantially better 
when interpreted analogously to AFLP or RAPD pro@es 
than with normal SSR analyses. Technically, however, they 

486 

enjoy the advantage of the classical SSR method, especially 
the use of specific primers in a single PCR reaction. Due to 
short DNA fragments amplified by specific primers, DNA 
degradation and contamination (often a problem in fieldcollected 
material) are much less critical than in AFLP 
fingerprinting, and the resulting rate of experimental errors 
in assigning genet identity should be lower. Moreover, 
AFLPs are prone to contamination by DNA from other 
organisms such as phytoparasitic fungi, which cannot be 
separated from the target. In polyploid organisms, the 
potential advantage of AFLP over SSR markers (i.e., their 
ability to generate many polymorphic markers with only 
a few primer combinations) is compensated by the higher 
discriminative power of SSRs. 

SSR fingerprinting in M. perennis offers new opportunities 
for small-scale studies of the biology of the species. Even in 
the small data set analyzed in this study, up to 4 physically 
independent merigenets were identified as members of the 
same clone (MLL) , highlighting the relevance of clonal 
reproduction in the reproductive and habitat colonization 
strategy ofM. perennis. Additionally, the analyses may help to 
assign nonflowering modules to their sex if flowering 
samples of the clone are included (compare Figure 2). Using 
AFLP fingerprinting, Vandepitte et al. (2009, 2(10) have 
provided first genotypic data on sex ratios and spatial 
patterns in M. perennis. However, with established polymorphic 
markers with sufficient resolution, the SSR 
technique is a real alternative to AFLP, even for polyploid 
organisms.
