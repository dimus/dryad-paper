Sexual harassment is a common outcome of sexual conflict over mating rate. A large number of studies have identified several direct costs to females of sexual harassment including energy expenditure and reduced foraging ability. However, the fitness consequences of sexual harassment for descendants have rarely been investigated. Here, we manipulated the level of sexual harassment and mating rate in two groups of female guppies, Poecilia reticulata, a live-bearing fish in which sexual conflict over mating rate is particularly pronounced. Each female was allowed to interact with three males for one day (low sexual harassment, LSH) or for eight days (high sexual harassment, HSH) during each breeding cycle throughout their life. Female lifetime fecundity did not differ between the groups, but we found a strong effect on offspring fitness. HSH females produced (1) daughters with smaller bodies and (2) sons with shorter gonopodia, which were less attractive to females and less successful in coercive matings than their LSH counterparts. Although these results may be influenced by the indirect effects of sex ratio differences between treatments, they suggest that sexual harassment and elevated mating rate can have negative cross-generational fitness effects and more profound evolutionary consequences than currently thought.
KEY WORDS: Inclusivefitness,life-history,lifetimefecundity,Poeciliareticulata,sexualconflict.
Sexual conflict is widespread in nature and occurs over a wide range of female–male interactions driving the evolution of sexually antagonistic traits (Rice 1996; Rice and Holland 1997; Chapman et al. 2003; Arnqvist and Rowe 2005). Mating frequency is one aspect of reproduction that typically fuels sexual conflict because males generally have a higher optimal mating rate than females (Parker 1979; Rowe 1994; Arnqvist et al. 2000). Males are therefore expected to evolve persistence traits (e.g., coercive mating tactics) to obtain as many copulations as possible, despite the costs this mating strategy imposes on females. A typical consequence of sexual conflict over mating rate is sexual harassment, which consists in persistent male attempts to mate with resisting females (Clutton-Brock and Parker 1995). The maleinduced costs to females associated with sexual harassment range from physical injuries, through larger energy expenditure and
foraging costs, to increased predation risk (for an extensive review see Arnqvist and Rowe 2005). The existence of these direct costs suggests that sexual harassment could negatively affect female fitness. However, the relationship between sexual harassment and female fitness depends on the form of the functions linking the costs and the benefits associated with multiple mating and their interaction (Arnqvist and Nilsson 2000; Arnqvist 2004; Maklakov et al. 2005) and may therefore vary in different species and under different conditions (e.g., Chapman and Partridge 1996; Maklakov et al. 2005). Most studies conducted so far have focused on the direct costs of sexual conflict and have revealed, with some exceptions (e.g., Head and Brooks 2006), that sexual harassment entails either short-term or life-time reduction in female fecundity (Ojanguren and Magurran 2007; den Hollander and Gwynne 2009; Gay et al. 2009; Rossi et al. 2010; Takahashi and Watanabe

         2010). However, sexual harassment may also affect the survival and reproductive success of the offspring. A more inclusive estimate of the fitness consequences of sexual harassment should therefore take into account its consequences on offspring fitness. However, whether, and to what extent, sexual harassment on females affects offspring fitness has been rarely investigated and with mixed results. In fact, the few studies performed so far have found negative (Maklakov and Arnqvist 2009), positive (Priest et al. 2008), or no effect of sexual harassment on offspring reproductive success (Le Galliard et al. 2008). Although negative fitness consequences of sexual conflict over mating rate are often postulated, such an outcome may not be straightforward because of trade-offs between current and future reproduction (Priest et al. 2008) or simply because multiple mating could have indirect (genetic) consequences (e.g., Fisher et al. 2006). More empirical studies are therefore needed to verify whether sexual conflict can have cross-generational fitness consequences.
Few vertebrates equal the level of sexual activity of male poeciliids (Farr 1989; Bisazza 1993; Pilastro et al. 1997, 2003; Schlupp et al. 2001; Plath et al. 2007). Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) males are no exception: field observations in their natural habitat in Trinidad have revealed that male guppies dedicate the principal amount of their time to obtaining copulations, whereas females are continually occupied in avoiding unwanted matings (Magurran and Seghers 1994a, c). In wild Trinidadian populations, female guppies receive approximately one mating attempt per minute (Magurran and Seghers 1994c). Female guppies are sexually receptive only when virgins or for short periods (two to three days) following parturition (Liley 1966) and constantly try to evade male mating attempts.
Male sexual harassment results in a significant reduction in female foraging rate (guppy: Magurran and Seghers 1994a; other poeciliids: Schlupp et al. 2001; Pilastro et al. 2003; Plath et al. 2007). Despite this foraging cost, studies investigating the effect of male sexual harassment on female fecundity in poeciliids have produced mixed results. For example, in one study on guppies, increased male sexual harassment reduced female fecundity (Ojanguren and Magurran 2007) whereas another experiment failed to find any effect (Head and Brooks 2006). In mosquitofish (Gen. Gambusia), male sexual harassment surprisingly resulted in increased female reproductive output (Smith and Sargent 2006; Smith 2007).
In this study we experimentally manipulated the level of sexual harassment experienced by two groups of guppy females (while keeping constant the number of potential mates) and investigated its effects on female fitness by measuring the body growth, survival, and lifetime fecundity of these two groups of females, along with the body size and swimming performance of their offspring at birth. We further explored the long-lasting crossgenerational effects of sexual harassment by raising to maturity
the offspring that were born about four months after the beginning of the experiment, and we measured several traits associated with their reproductive success, such as survival and body size (in daughters and sons), and gonopodium length, ejaculate quality, sexual behavior, and sexual attractiveness (in sons only).
Materials and Methods
STUDY SPECIES
The guppy is a small freshwater fish with a polyandrous, nonresource-based mating system (Houde 1997). To obtain copulations, males can employ either of two mating tactics interchangeably. Males can court females by performing conspicuous displays in front of them, called “sigmoid displays,” or can attempt to overcome female resistance using forced copulations, called “gonopodial thrusts” (Liley 1966). During their sexually receptive phase, which lasts for two to three days after parturition (Liley 1966) females mate with more than one male (Evans and Magurran 2000; Pitcher et al. 2003). For the rest of the breeding cycle, which lasts on average 25–30 days, females usually refuse to copulate (Houde 1997).
THE STUDY POPULATION AND ITS MAINTENANCE
We used guppy descendants of wild-caught fish collected in 2002 from the lower part of Tacarigua River, Trinidad, a high-predation locality. The initial population consisted of more than 500 adults. As the females were pregnant, and the average number of sires per brood is about 3.5 (Houde 1997; Magurran 2005) the effective size of the founding population was therefore larger. Fish were maintained on a temperature regime of 26 ± 1◦C and on a 12 h light/dark cycle. All fish were fed a mixed diet of brine shrimp nauplii (Artemia salina) and commercially prepared flake food, which were provided ad libitum. Males and females were maintained in stock aquaria with a sex ratio of roughly 1:1. To obtain virgin females, newborns were isolated from adults and reared to maturity in dedicated tanks. Once recognizable as females, usually within two to three weeks, virgins were kept separate from males until they were used for the experiments.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Sixty-two females were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups. The two groups of females experienced, throughout their lives, different levels of male sexual harassment: “low sexual harassment” (hereafter LSH) and “high sexual harassment” (hereafter HSH). To obtain females at the same stage of the reproductive cycle, and with the same sexual experience, we artificially inseminated virgin females (4 to 6 months old) with equal numbers of sperm bundles (packages of sperm) collected from seven males. Each female was inseminated with only four bundles to

minimize the risk of storing surplus sperm. The number of females inseminated by each male was evenly divided between the two experimental groups. Artificial inseminations (AI) were performed following a standard protocol (see Pilastro et al. 2008). About 15 days after the AI, females that were recognized as pregnant, were placed individually in the experimental tanks. A total of 31 experimental tanks (52 × 36 × 43, length × width × depth filled to about 30 cm) were each equipped with a filter, plastic plants, gravel substrate and maintained under the same conditions as the stock tanks. Each tank was divided into two identical sectors by an opaque partition (for a total of 62 sectors) each one containing an experimental female, assigned to opposite treatments. The partitions allowed water to flow between the sectors but prevented visual interaction between neighboring fish. The experimental treatments started after each female delivered her first brood (which resulted from the artificially inseminated sperm) and were performed at every reproductive cycle throughout each female’s lifetime.
In the LSH treatment, three males were allowed to simultaneously interact with the female for 1 day during her receptive period (24 h following the parturition). In the HSH treatment, three males were allowed to interact with the female for eight consecutive days during her unreceptive period (from the 8th to the 15th day after parturition—in the middle of the reproductive cycle, Houde 1997). Males were chosen randomly from among 200 males (reared in large tanks containing approximately 50 fish and with sex ratio of 1:1), isolated from females for one day before being used in the experiment, and then returned to their original tank. The two groups of females had equal opportunities to mate with an equal number of randomly chosen males, thus any effect on offspring phenotype would likely derive from maternal effects rather than from the genetic contribution of the sire. To minimize differences in the level of food competition, three sexually immature females, whose body size was similar to that of the males, were introduced into the LSH sectors for the same period as the males occupied the HSH sectors, that is, days 8–15 after the focal female’s parturition. Previous work has shown that males and females of similar body size do not differ in their feeding rate (Dussault and Kramer 1981) suggesting that competition for food (which was provided ad libitum, see above) did not differ between treatments.
Estimate of male sexual harassment
To estimate the level of sexual harassment experienced by the groups of females, each experimental female was observed for 30 to 45 min (between 0900 and 1000 h) during the first, second, and fourth treatment cycles. Observations were conducted twice for the LSH group (soon after males entered the tank and before males were removed from the tank) and three times per cycle for the HSH group (on days 1, 4, and 8 of male presence) to
have an average estimate of male sexual activity. We recorded the number of sigmoid displays, the gonopodial thrusts (no prior courtship, male swings his gonopodium forward at least 90◦, and attempts a forced mating) received per minute by each female and the number of the two types of copulations (following a sigmoid display or a gonopodial thrust) per hour. Copulations were considered successful if they were followed by a series of postcopulatory jerks by males, which signal successful sperm transfer (Liley 1966; Pilastro et al. 2007).
FEMALE LIFETIME FECUNDITY, GROWTH, AND SURVIVAL
Female lifetime fecundity and survival
Experimental tanks were checked for fry at least twice a day to record the number and birth day of each brood until each experimental female died. The AI-induced broods preceding the start of the experimental treatment were not considered in the analyses. For the sake of simplicity, we numbered the broods produced by the females after the initiation of the treatments starting from 1, although this was actually the second brood.
Female growth
Female standard length (SL) and weight were measured twice, after the AI-induced parturition and after the third parturition (on average, about 91 days elapsed between the two measures). To minimize stress, no anesthetic was used: a female was gently placed in a small transparent box filled with water with a millimeter rule on the background (to calibrate measurements) and a photo was taken with a digital camera. Then, a small box with water was calibrated and subsequently weighed together with the female to give the female’s weight. The average of three measures to the nearest 0.01 g was used in the analyses. Female weight was measured at the same point of their reproductive cycle each time (i.e., four days after parturition) to avoid differences in weight due to developing embryos.
OFFSPRING QUALITY
Offspring body size and swimming performance at birth
We measured the body size (SL and abdomen width in millimeters) of newborns (up to 25 per brood) collected from broods 2 to 10, (2764 newborns from 230 broods, 113 HSH and 117 LSH) from digital photos taken the day after the birth, using UTHSCSA Image Tool (http://ddsdx.uthscsa.edu/dig/itdesc.html).
Offspring collected at the second parturition were tested for swimming performance: schooling and escape abilities. These two measurements are considered to indicate the ability of newborn fish to evade predators and to affect their survival in the wild (Magurran 2005). Details of both protocols are reported in Evans et al. (2007). Briefly, brood mates were paired and put in a
 534 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY2012

         circular arena one pair at a time, and the time they spent schooling (swimming closely together and turning in synchrony) over a 10-min period was recorded. Following the schooling trial, we estimated escape ability for individual offspring as the time taken to catch both the fish with a hand net.
Sex ratio and body size at sexual maturity
To study if sexual harassment affected the expression of traits associated with reproductive success in offspring, we collected HSH and LSH broods at parturition number four (i.e., after four treatment cycles). Fry were reared in groups of six individuals in 1l plastic tanks, labeled according to treatment and mother’s identity. The offspring were transferred to these tanks after parturition, before they could be sexed, and sex ratio therefore differed between tanks. All the offspring grew in lightand temperaturecontrolled conditions. A recirculating water system guaranteed that water quality was constant across rearing tanks. We measured the body size (SL; in mm) of daughters and sons at four months of age, when guppies are fully sexually mature (Houde 1997). Density (Barlow 1992) and sex ratio (Rodd et al. 1997; Smith and Sargent 2006) affect growth rate in poeciliids. We therefore excluded those tanks in which some of the offspring died during this four-month period and used the proportion of males in the rearing tank as a covariate in the analyses of body size.
Sons’ reproductive quality
A total of 196 sons (from 13 HSH females and 17 LSH females) were tested to estimate reproductive quality. We considered the following traits, which are associated with males’ expected reproductive success: (a) body coloration and gonopodium length, (b) sexual behavior (courtship rate and rate of gonopodial thrusting), (c) attractiveness, and (d) ejaculate traits (number of sperm at rest and sperm velocity).
(a) Body coloration and gonopodium length. Males were photographed using a digital camera (Nikon CoolPix 4300, Nikon, Japan). Photos were analyzed using UTHSCSA Image Tool to measure SL, gonopodium length, total area of the body, and relative area of the colored spots of each male (three categories: orange, black and iridescent). Measures are expressed in mm or mm2.
(b) Sexual behavior. Each male was observed individually with an unreceptive, unfamiliar female randomly chosen from a stock tank and left to acclimatize for 5 h in the observation tank before the male was introduced. Observations were initiated when the male resumed normal behavior, usually within 1–5 min of introduction. The number of sigmoid displays, gonopodial thrusts, and swings (movements of the gonopodium) were recorded over a 20-min period. Gonopodial thrusts were considered successful when contact between the gonopodium tip and female genital
opening occurred, clearly evident by a sudden jerk of the female. Although only a small proportion of these contacts usually result in sperm transfer (Liley 1966), males can transfer substantial sperm numbers through coercive copulations (Pilastro and Bisazza 1999) and we therefore assume that genital contacts represent an index of mating success. Each male and female were used only once in the sexual behavior experiments.
(c) Sexual attractiveness. Dichotomous choice trials were performed to compare the sexual attractiveness of HSH and LSH sons. The choice tank was divided into three parts: one central chamber containing a sexually receptive virgin female and two smaller side chambers in which the position of the HSH and LSH males was alternated (i.e., HSH males were positioned in the left chamber in half of the trials). After an initial acclimatization period (20 min) the female’s position was registered every 5 s over a 30-min period. Preference was expressed as the number of times the female was within two SLs of the HSH or LHS chamber (for details see Gasparini et al. 2010). Each male and female were used only once.
(d) Ejaculate traits. The number of sperm at rest was estimated by stripping males previously deprived of females for three days (this resting period allows males to restore their sperm reserves after recent copulations, Kuckuck and Greven 1997). Ejaculates were obtained from 194 of the 196 males and diluted in an appropriate volume of physiological solution (0.9% NaCl). Free sperm solutions were obtained by vortexing the solution for 1 min. The total number of sperm was estimated with an “Improved Neubauer” haematocytometer (see Pilastro et al. 2007). Sperm velocity assays were performed on a subset of the available fish (n = 44), using a CEROS Sperm Tracker (Hamilton Thorne Research, Beverly, MA, version 12.3). Average path velocity (VAP), straight line velocity (VSL), and curvilinear velocity (VCL) measures were based on 58.27 (±5.02 SE) motile sperm and the average of measures from two different sperm bundles was used. For brevity, we present results only for VAP, as results were similar for VSL and VCL. The threshold values defining static cells were predetermined at 20 μm/s for VAP and 15 μm/s for VSL (Gasparini et al. 2009).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed using PASW statistics version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GenStat 12. When we compared multiple data collected from the same female (such as brood size in successive broods, phenotypic differences between offspring, etc.), we used linear mixed-effects models with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation (LMM), in which the identity of the female (mother) and the rearing tank (only for offspring traits measured after their sexual maturation) were entered as random factors to control for nonindependence

of the data. Data were tested for homogeneity of variance and for homogeneity of the slopes in those cases in which one covariate was included in the model. If not otherwise stated, means are reported with their standard errors (SE).
Results
ESTIMATE OF MALE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
Females in the HSH treatment experienced significantly more intense sexual harassment than their LSH counterparts. Males directed more courtship displays and gonopodial thrusts per minute toward females in the HSH group than in the LSH group (gonopodial thrusts received by the female, HSH: 1.11 ± 0.08, LSH: 0.62 ± 0.05 t58 = 5.17, P < 0.001; displays received by the female, HSH: 0.52 ± 0.03, LSH: 0.20 ± 0.02 t58 = 8.07, P < 0.001). As HSH females were exposed to male harassment for 96 daylight hours versus 12 h of LSH females, HSH females received approximately 15 times more mating attempts per breeding cycle (gonopodial thrusts, HSH: 90.6–122.0, LSH: 6.79–9.40; displays, HSH: 44.0–55.9, LSH: 2.0–3.3; 95% C.I.). Overall, the observed level of sexual harassment rate was similar to that reported in previous studies (Magurran and Seghers 1994c; Schlupp et al. 2001; Pilastro et al. 2003; Plath et al. 2007).
The estimated copulation rate was similar between treatments (copulations hour−1 , HSH: 0.39 ± 0.09, LSH: 0.52 ± 0.10), resulting in a six times higher number of matings per breeding cycle for HSH females (HSH: 20.6–54.2, LSH: 4.1–9.4; 95% C.I.). Experimental treatment therefore had two distinct effects, it increased both the level of sexual harassment and the mating rate. Although our observations were not specifically aimed at measuring female foraging rate, we did not observe any case in which the female retreated to a corner and her foraging was impaired. Male–male interactions were infrequent and occurred at the same rate as in stock tanks.
FEMALE LIFETIME FECUNDITY, GROWTH, AND SURVIVAL
Female lifetime fecundity and survival
Overall, we obtained 316 broods for a total of 4874 offspring. Mean female lifetime fecundity did not differ significantly between treatments (HSH: 85.06 offspring ± 14.25, range = 0– 301; LSH: 72.16 ± 11.78, range = 0–296; t60 = 0.698, P = 0.488). Mean brood size did not differ significantly between treatments but there was a significant interaction between treatment and brood number, suggesting a difference in the timing of reproductive allocation (treatment, F1,56.1 = 2.08, P = 0.16; brood number, F 1,233.3 = 10.93, P = 0.001; interaction between treatment and brood no., F1,192.9 = 6.30, P = 0.013, cubic smoothing spline; LMM, random factor: female identity). Analysis includ-

ing female SL as a covariate for the two broods for which this information was available revealed that the brood size was, as expected, positively correlated with female size (brood no. 1: F1,60 = 23.46, P < 0.001, brood no. 3: F 1,36 = 7.841, P = 0.008), but did not change the results regarding the effect of treatment on brood size (data not shown). HSH females showed a relatively greater fecundity early in life, but their reproductive output remained stable, or declined, afterward. In contrast, LSH females, which initially produced smaller broods, continuously increased their brood size until parturition number 8 (see Fig. 1). Afterward, the number of surviving females dropped to 9 (HSH: n = 4, LSH: n = 5) and brood size declined in both groups, with the exception of a single HSH female whose last brood was very large (31 offspring). Interbrood intervals did not differ significantly between groups (HSH: 33.26 days ± 0.62; LSH: 32.98 days ± 0.53; treatment F1,39 = 0.39, P = 0.54; brood no. F1,301.8 = 9.31, P = 0.002; interaction between treatment and brood no. F1,301.1 = 0.15, P = 0.70; LMM, random factor: female identity).
Female survival after the beginning of the experiment did not differ between the groups (LSH: 211.1 days ± 21.69, range = 43–489; HSH: 208.2 days ± 20.47, range = 32–483; t60 = 0.10, P = 0.92, Student t test). Mortality was equally distributed between the groups over the duration of the experiment (Mantel Cox test, χ2 = 0.110, P = 0.74; Fig. 2).

Female growth
Females of both groups did not differ in their initial SL (t1,60 = 0.989, P = 0.33), or weight (t1,60 = 1.337, P = 0.19). Females’ SL increased significantly over time (repeated measure ANOVA: F1,36 = 179.30, P < 0.001), but did not differ between treatments (HSH: 28.23 mm ± 0.60, LSH: 28.05 mm ± 0.45; F1,36 = 0.967, P = 0.33). The same pattern was observed for females’ body weight, which also increased between the two measurements (F1,37 = 158.89, P<0.001) but did not differ between treatments (HSH: 0.42 mm ± 0.02, LSH: 0.40 mm ± 0.01; F1,37 = 2.605, P = 0.12).
OFFSPRING QUALITY
Offspring size and swimming performance at birth
Offspring body size at birth did not differ between treatments after controlling for brood size (dependent variable: offspring SL; fixed factor: treatment, F1,48.1 = 2.29, P = 0.14; covariates: brood size, F1,214.6 = 6.14, P = 0.014; brood no., F1,181.7 = 2.18, P = 0.031; dependent variable: offspring abdomen width; fixed factor: treatment, F1,45.6 = 0.77, P = 0.38; covariates: brood size, F1,216 = 5.16, P = 0.024; brood no. F1,185 = 2.21, P = 0.028; LMM; nbroods = 230; random factor: female identity). Treatment did not influence the newborns’ swimming performance, in terms of either schooling behavior (treatment: F1,42 = 0.009, P = 0.92, interbrood interval: F1,42 = 0.005, P = 0.95) or escape ability (treatment: F1,42 = 0.118, P = 0.73, interbrood interval: F1,42 = 6.097, P = 0.02).
We sexed 389 offspring from 29 females (HSH: n = 12; LSH: n = 17). The sex ratio did not differ between treatments (HSH: 0.47 ± 0.05; LSH: 0.53 ± 0.03; deviance ratio = 1.37, P = 0.25, generalized linear model with binomial error distribution, dependent variable: no. of males, binomial total: brood size).
Survival rate and body size at sexual maturity
Survival rate of the offspring to the age of four months did not differ between treatments (HSH = 93.1% ± 2.24; LSH = 92.1% ± 3.08; F1,67 = 0. 04, P = 0.84, generalized linear model with binomial error distribution, dependent variable: no. of survived, binomial total: initial number of offspring in the rearing tank ( = 6); random factor: female identity). At the age of four months, we measured the SL of 312 offspring (157 daughters and 155 sons) from 25 females (HSH: n = 11; LSH: n = 14). HSH daughters, but not sons, show a significant reduction in body size than their LSH counterparts (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
Sons’ reproductive quality
(a) Body coloration and gonopodium length. The area of the three categories of color spots (orange, black and iridescent) did not vary significantly with treatment (F6,95.5 = 1.30, P = 0.27), and was negatively associated with a male-biased sex ratio (F3,127.1 = 2.65, P = 0.052; HSH: nsons = 99, nbroods = 13 LSH: nsons = 97, nbroods = 17, multivariate LMM). Analyzed separately, none of the three color categories revealed any significant effect of the treatment (all P > 0.11, univariate LMM). The negative effect of sex ratio on colors was completely driven by the iridescent color (b = –0.036, SE = 0.013, P = 0.007), whereas orange and black colors were not affected (all P > 0.59). In contrast, gonopodium length differed significantly between treatments, with male offspring of LSH females having longer gonopodia (F1,18.1 = 6.67, P = 0.019, HSH: nsons = 74, nbroods = 12 LSH: nsons = 77, nbroods = 13). This difference remained significant after statistically controlling for body size (treatment: F1,18.1 = 6.59,

Effect of treatment (continuous line, dashed lines = 95% C.I.) on gonopodium length across male body size (SL, mm), as estimated using Johnson–Neyman procedure (see methods). Negative values of the regression coefficient (Y axis) indicate that HSH male offspring have a shorter gonopodium than their LSH counterparts of equal body size.
P = 0.019). We found a significant interaction between treatment and body size (body size, F1,131.6 = 6.24, P = 0.014; interaction, F1,128.5 = 4.97, P = 0.028). We used the Johnson—Neyman procedure, as implemented in SPSS (Hayes and Matthes 2009), to investigate the effect of treatment on gonopodium length at various levels of the covariate (body size, Fig. 4). The results suggest that the negative effect of treatment on gonopodium length is stronger (and significant) only in mediumand large-sized males. Similar results were obtained when we used family means (mean

The proportion of successful gonopodial thrusts was significantly higher in LSH sons and was positively correlated with the body size of the female and negatively correlated with the size of the male (Fig. 5, HSH: 0.130 ± 0.021, nsons = 58, nbroods = 12; LSH: 0.174 ± 0.017, nsons = 71, nbroods = 13; treatment: F1,23.8 = 67.57, P = 0.011, b = 0.446, SE = 0.162; female body size (TL): F1,117.1 = 12.63, P < 0.001, b = 0.081, SE = 0.023; male body size (SL): F1,121.7 = 2.85, P = 0.094, b = –0.160, SE = 0.095; generalized LMM with

The frequency of sigmoid displays and the total number of gonopodial thrusts and the number of gonopodial swings performed by the sons were not affected by treatment, although a tendency for more intense sexual activity in the LSH sons was observed (multivariate LMM, F1,41.8 = 2.45, P = 0.077; courtship display rate: b = 0.302, SE = 1.170; swing rate: b = 3.799, SE = 1.616; total number of gonopodial thrusts: b = 1.758, SE = 0.346; random factor: female identity; male and female body size were all NS and were not included in the final model; HSH as reference level).
(c) Sexual attractiveness. Dichotomous mate choice tests revealed that LSH sons were more attractive to females than were their HSH counterparts (Fig. 6) and this difference remained significant after statistically controlling for differences in body size and the size of color spots (Table 2). No significant interactions between treatment and male traits were detected.
(d) Ejaculate traits. Sons of HSH females had more sperm on average than LSH sons (number of sperm × 106 HSH: 6.83 ± 0.30, nsons = 98, nbroods = 13; LSH: 5.87 ± 0.33, nsons = 96, nbroods = 17), but the difference was not significant once the identity of the female and the rearing tank were taken into account (treatment: F1,25.7 = 1.77, P = 0.196; LMM). Including son’s body size (SL) and the rearing-tank sex ratio as covariates did not change these results (treatment: F1,26.0 = 2.31, P = 0.14), but revealed a significant positive effect of sex ratio (no. of females) on sperm reserves (no. of females: b = –0.503, SE = 0.225, F1,64.6 = 5.02, P = 0.029; SL: F1,175.4 = 0.06, P = 0.81). Sperm velocity did not differ between groups (VAP, HSH: 61.01 ± 2.98, nsons = 21, nbroods = 10; LSH: 63.54 ± 4.28, nsons = 23, nbroods = 13; F1,16.4 = 0.23, P = 0.64; LMM, random factor: female identity).

 Our experimental design resulted in 15 times more intense sexual harassment (number of courtship displays and gonopodial thrusts received) and six times more frequent copulations for HSH females than their LSH counterparts. Effects of treatment on female fitness could therefore depend on sexual harassment, mating rate, or both. Males courted more intensely unreceptive (HSH) than receptive (LSH) females, probably a consequence of males temporarily reducing their sexual activity after mating (Pilastro and Bisazza 1999). Indeed, most copulations occurred soon after a male was introduced into the female’s tank and whereas all LSH females were observed only in the hours following introduction, HSH observations were distributed over the eight days during each breeding cycle. Courtship rate was positively correlated with the time elapsed after HSH, but not LSH, males were introduced into the tank (data not shown).
EFFECT OF EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT ON FEMALE LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS
Experimental treatment affected the timing of reproductive allocation but not the total number of offspring produced. Although HSH females’ first brood after the beginning of the experiment was less numerous than that of LSH females (see Ojanguren and Magurran 2007 for a similar result) brood size rapidly increased over the three subsequent brood cycles in the HSH group. A similar initial effect of male-biased sex ratio on fecundity has been reported in the western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis (Smith and Sargent 2006). After parturition number four, the brood size of HSH females showed little further increase. In contrast, LSH females showed a nearly linear brood-size increase over the course

of the experiment (Fig. 1), as would be normally expected given the positive correlation between female body size and fecundity (Reznick et al. 2004). In HSH females, the observed fecundity trend may result from a trade-off of early versus late reproduction, as in the damselfly Hetaerina americana (Cordoba-Aguilar 2009). This differential reproductive allotment may be a consequence of an antagonistic manipulation of females’ reproductive investment by males. In several poeciliid species, forced copulations result in wounds in the female genital opening and vaginal bleeding (Constantz 1984; Greven 2005) which may be adaptive for males as they induce the females to invest more in the current reproduction, as predicted by the “adaptive harm hypothesis” (Johnstone and Keller 2000; Lessells 2005). Seminal fluid components also increase reproductive rate beyond females’ optimum, at least earlier in life (e.g., Reinhardt et al. 2009). Unfortunately, nothing is known about composition and effects of seminal fluids in poeciliids (Evans and Pilastro 2011). Clearly, understanding the cause of this differential investment is an avenue for future research.
We found no other direct effects of treatment on life-time fecundity, female survival and growth. This was surprising as the presence of harassing males is associated with a significant reduction in female foraging rate (>25%) in this fish family (Magurran and Seghers 1994b; Schlupp et al. 2001; Pilastro et al. 2003; Plath et al. 2007). Although our fish were fed ad libitum, in the wild food is probably less abundant and unpredictably distributed and foraging costs are expected to be higher as females have to divide their attention between potential predators and harassing males (see for example Evans et al. 2002).
EFFECTS OF EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT ON OFFSPRING QUALITY
Although there were no significant effects on offspring size and performance (schooling and escape ability) at birth, experimental treatment had a negative effect on offspring reproductive quality at maturity. HSH daughters showed a smaller body size at four months than their LSH counterparts, suggesting a fecundity cost for female offspring (e.g., Reznick and Endler 1982; Farr 1989; this study). Body size of male offspring did not differ between groups, but HSH sons had slightly (about 3%) but significantly shorter gonopodia (although this effect was not significant in small males, Fig. 4). A shorter gonopodium may be an index of poorer condition, as a longer gonopodium likely impose greater hydrodynamic costs (Langerhans et al. 2005). Males with longer gonopodia are preferred by females in some populations (Brooks and Caithness 1995) and are also favored in obtaining coercive matings (Evans et al. 2011). This is indirectly confirmed by the higher proportion of genital contact obtained by LSH sons with unreceptive females. Our data also revealed that HSH sons were less attractive to receptive females than their LSH
counterparts. Although we do not know whether female preference was influenced by gonopodium length, this was the only sexually selected trait that was significantly different between the two groups of males. Finally, sons from the two experimental groups did not differ for any of the postcopulatory traits measured, such as sperm number and velocity, which are associated with sperm competition success in the guppy (Boschetto et al. 2011).
CONCLUSIONS
The observed association between sexual harassment and mating rate experienced by the HSH mothers and the reduced reproductive quality of their offspring could be determined by both genetic and nongenetic, maternal effects. If HSH offspring were more frequently sired by males that were particularly successful in obtaining forced copulations, one would expect HSH offspring to be, in turn, more successful when adopting this mating tactic, if this capability has a heritable component. We found the opposite pattern and this explanation seems therefore unlikely. The higher mating rate observed in HSH group, however, is also likely to increase the level of sperm competition. If more successful sperm competitors have lower quality genotypes (Bilde et al. 2009), the poorer performance of HSH offspring may be a consequence of higher sperm competition. This may not be the case in guppies, because offspring performance at birth is correlated with the expression of male ornaments (Evans et al. 2004), which in turn is positively associated sperm competition success (Evans et al. 2003), and with polyandry (Evans and Magurran 2000; Ojanguren et al. 2005). However, adult survival and male attractiveness are genetically and negatively correlated (Brooks 2000), and the genetic consequences of sperm competition on adult offspring are still unknown.
The alternative scenario is that the experimental treatment negatively affected the mothers’ condition that, in turn, influenced offspring reproductive quality. Long-lasting effects of parents’ condition on offspring quality have been found, for example, in the fish A. polyacanthus, in which parents in a poor condition produce smaller juveniles (Donelson et al. 2009). In the case of the guppy, higher sexual harassment and mating rate experienced by HSH females may result in higher levels of stress hormones, which could negatively affect the survival, growth rate, and behavior of the progeny (e.g., Welberg and Seckl 2001; Andersson et al. 2004; Rubolini et al. 2005). Alternatively, injuries to the external female genitalia associated with forced copulation (Constantz 1984; Greven 2005) may induce increased investment in immune function which, in turn, may have negative effects on the quality of eggs and offspring (Cucco et al. 2010). Ejaculate components may be involved in determining the observed pattern also (e.g., Wigby and Chapman 2005), although nothing is known about composition and role of seminal fluid in poeciliids (Evans
 540 EVOLUTION FEBRUARY2012

         and Pilastro 2011). Finally, the lower quality of HSH offspring may be the result of a trade-off between brood size and offspring quality, as HSH females produced, on average, larger broods earlier in life (offspring raised to maturity were from brood no. 4) than did their LSH counterparts.
To experimentally manipulate sexual conflict over mating rate, we varied the sex ratio, which may contribute per se to the observed pattern. For example, actual sex ratio may be used by females as an index of the competition for food that offspring will face. Guppy females invest more resources per offspring as a response to future low food levels (Reznick and Yang 1993), and LSH females may have invested relatively more in offspring quality, as guppy females are, on average, larger than males and feeding rate depends on size (Dussault and Kramer 1981). A study in which sex ratio was varied experimentally, but differences in sexual harassment were controlled for, revealed that female-biased sex ratios result in the production of larger sons at birth, whereas daughters’ body size is not affected (Barbosa and Magurran 2010). We found the opposite pattern (daughter were larger, but not sons), suggesting that differences in sex ratio per se are unlikely to be the only explanation for our results. Finally, female guppies prefer to school with other females, although this preference is significant only among familiar fish (Griffiths and Magurran 1998). HSH females could not form same-sex shoals and may have therefore experienced a more stressful condition, which could have affected offspring quality. Sexual harassment is likely to magnify any such effect in nature, as it disrupts social associations and prevents social recognition (Darden et al. 2009), determining suboptimal schooling conditions.
Whatever the proximate cause of the negative fitness consequences observed in HSH females, our study provides evidence that elevated sexual harassment and mating rate are associated with cross-generational costs on female fitness. The evolutionary consequences of sexual conflict over mating rate depend on whether the effect we detected in the fourth brood is present in earlier broods also, as the survival rate of adult guppies is rather low in the field (Olendorf et al. 2006). Although the concomitant effects of sex ratio on female reproductive strategy still need to be fully evaluated, our results suggest that sexual conflict over mating rate can impair the reproductive performance of the next generation, and add to the handful of studies that have conclusively demonstrated negative consequences of sexual conflict over mating rate (Wedell et al. 2006; Maklakov and Arnqvist 2009).
