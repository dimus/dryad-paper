Abstract
Heavy fishing and other anthropogenic influences can have profound impact on a species’ resilience to harvesting. Besides the decrease in the census and effective population size, strong declines in mature adults and recruiting individuals may lead to almost irreversible genetic changes in life-history traits. Here, we investigated the evolution of genetic diversity and effective population size in the heavily exploited sole (Solea solea), through the analysis of historical DNA from a collection of 1379 sole otoliths dating back from 1957. Despite documented shifts in life-history traits, neutral genetic diversity inferred from 11 microsatellite markers showed a remarkable stability over a period of 50 years of heavy fishing. Using simulations and corrections for fisheries induced demographic variation, both single-sample estimates and temporal estimates of effective population size (Ne) were always higher than 1000, suggesting that despite the severe census size decrease over a 50-year period of harvesting, genetic drift is probably not strong enough to significantly decrease the neutral diversity of this species in the North Sea. However, the inferred ratio of effective population size to the census size (Ne ⁄ Nc) appears very small (10)5), suggesting that overall only a low proportion of adults contribute to the next generation. The high Ne level together with the low Ne ⁄ Nc ratio is probably caused by a combination of an equalized reproductive output of younger cohorts, a decrease in generation time and a large variance in reproductive success typical for marine species. Because strong evolutionary changes in age and size at first maturation have been observed for sole, changes in adaptive genetic variation should be further monitored to detect the evolutionary consequences of human-induced selection.

user et al. 2002; Kenchington et al. 2003). The direct effects of fishing are obvious; it causes an increase in mortality of both target and nontarget species. Selective harvesting may also shift the size and age structure or the sex ratio of a stock, by selectively removing part of the population, which on its turn can have profound effects on the reproductive output (Jennings et al. 2001;

Kenchington et al. 2003). Although life-history traits are plastic and vary in response to the environment, there is growing evidence that exploitation might also cause irreversible evolutionary changes in fish populations. As many of the life-history traits are heritable, they will evolve in response to fishing pressure (Heino 1998; Law 2000). For several marine fish, such trends have recently been observed towards earlier sexual maturation at smaller size (Conover et al. 2005; Jørgensen et al. 2007; Kuparinen & Merila ̈ 2007; Mollet et al. 2007). As fishing reduces population size, it may also reduce genetic variation if there are not enough individuals to maintain the full range of variability (Hauser et al. 2002; Lage & Kornfield 2006). This will primarily result in the loss of alleles owing to genetic drift or in further instance even in the loss of heterozygosity (Hoelzel et al. 2006; Allendorf et al. 2008). A decrease in genetic variation has been associated with inbreeding depression, the accumulation of deleterious alleles (owing to high genetic load) and reduced adaptive potential (Frankham et al. 2002).
Generally, genetic diversity only starts to decline when population numbers are becoming very small (Ne < 500; Franklin 1980). As overexploited or collapsed fish stocks may still include millions of adult fish, it has been assumed that the loss of genetic diversity should remain minimal (Hutchings & Reynolds 2004). However, the maintenance of genetic diversity depends on the effective population size (Ne), a challenging key parameter to measure for marine conservation genetics (Waples et al. 2008). Several studies have indeed indicated a reduced genetic diversity in overexploited stocks, suggesting that the number of fish that are reproducing and contributing to diversity is actually much smaller than the total numbers present (Hauser et al. 2002; Hutchinson et al. 2003). This implies that despite their large spawning stock biomass, genetic diversity can get lost (Hauser et al. 2002).
Genetic methods for estimating Ne in natural populations are most often based on the measurement of variance in allele frequencies between generations (‘variance effective size’). One of the most used and reliable methods when multiple samples are available is the temporal method where the harmonic mean of Ne during the sampling period is estimated based on the observed rate of genetic drift (Waples 1989; Wang 2005). This estimate gains more accuracy with an increasing number of generations between the temporal samples and sufficiently high sampling sizes (Wang 2005; Waples & Yokota 2007).
Evolutionary effects of exploitation can be investigated by comparing genetic diversity in samples before and after periods of intensive exploitation (Hauser et al. 2002; Saisa et al. 2003). To assess with accuracy the
recent historical loss of genetic diversity in fish stocks because of climatic, environmental and anthropogenic influences, one needs to compare the contemporary level of genetic variation with a historical baseline level (representative for a lower anthropogenic impact), hence avoiding the shifting-baselines trap (Pinnegar & Engelhard 2008). An analysis of a continuous time series of historical material rather than sporadic old samples may thus increase the confidence in genetic estimates of population sizes. Hence, archived otoliths collected during a century of fisheries science form an ideal source of DNA to assess changes in genetic diversity over time (Nielsen & Hansen 2008). Although these earstones, originally used for age determination, are acellular, DNA can be extracted from the adhering dried tissue with great success (Hutchinson et al. 1999; Cuveliers et al. 2009). Combined with a detailed knowledge on the demography, otolith genetic analyses can provide crucial information about the evolutionary consequences of demographic instability and the effects of size selective fishery.
From the 1960s onwards, large beam trawlers were operating in the North Sea leading to a concomitant increase in exploitation level (Millner & Whiting 1996; Rijnsdorp et al. 2008). Sole (Solea solea L.), together with plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.) and cod (Gadus morhua L.), has always been a target species of the North Sea beam trawl fisheries. For the latter two species, either a low effective population size or fluctuations in genetic diversity have been observed and related to overexploitation (Hutchinson et al. 2003; Hoarau et al. 2005). Additionally, indications of fisheries-induced changes in maturation reaction norms were observed in North Sea plaice and sole, namely a shift towards maturation at earlier age and smaller size (Grift et al. 2003; Rijnsdorp et al. 2005; Mollet et al. 2007; van Walraven et al. 2010). Such changes in life-history traits may occur as a response to size-selective harvesting.
In North Sea sole, spawning is triggered by sea water temperature, with maturity typically at age three or four and fecundity strongly correlated with size (Rijnsdorp et al. 1992; Horwood 2001). Fecundity of a 35-cm female sole also varies with latitude with around 200 000 eggs off Portugal to around 450 000 eggs in the southeastern North Sea (Witthames et al. 1995a). As sole represents one of the most important resources in the North Sea, with an average yearly landing of more than 16 000 tonnes in the last decade and fishing mortalities above the precautionary approach reference point (F > Fpa = 0.4), there is an urgent need to assess the evolutionary consequences of such harvesting pressure and the observed shifts in age at reproduction on the level of neutral and adaptive genetic diversity and thus the long-term evolutionary resilience of sole.

EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZE IN THE OVEREXPLOITED NORTH SEA SOLE 3557
specifically, because of the aforementioned discrepancy between effective size and census size in other marine fish, the observed changes in life-history traits in North Sea sole and the increased fishing pressure from the 1960s onwards, we wanted to investigate whether there has been a decrease in the genetic diversity of sole.
To improve the likelihood and power of detecting such a decrease in genetic diversity and effective population size in sole, we tried to optimize the sampling design based on the only extensive available archived collection of sole otoliths (1957–1995) from the North Sea, associated with detailed fisheries data providing additional information on the demographic stability of the stock. Hence, we aimed at an analysis design including many mixed-cohort samples from equally spaced temporal points overarching the increase in fishing pressure. Thanks to the availability of accurate individual ages, it was possible to investigate the fluctuations in genetic variability between sampling years with a mixed-cohort design and between single year classes over a 50-year period. We performed corrections for (the often overlooked) fisheries induced generation time decrease, carried out power simulations and used both single-sample and temporal estimates of effective population size (Ne). Finally, we discuss several alternative hypotheses to explain the commonly observed constant or underestimated Ne but low Ne ⁄ Nc ratio in heavily exploited type III survival marine fish.
Materials and methods
Samples
Historical sole otoliths from the North Sea were obtained from a large collection curated by the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies (IMARES, The Netherlands). Otolith samples were collected during research surveys or commercial sampling in January–April covering the Southern North Sea in the years 1957–1995 and preserved dry in paper envelopes (approximate positionsFig. 1). All selected otoliths were aged according to standard methodologies (Millner & Whiting 1996). To maximize the genetic information content and to minimize the sampling bias, we aimed at jointly clustering individuals in separate cohorts and age groups, besides multiple sampling years. The molecular analyses were performed on a total of 1159 historical samples, consisting of 215 aged samples from the 1950s (‘NS50’; sampling years 1957– 1959), 205 samples from the 1960s (‘NS60’; sampling years 1966–1967), 205 samples from the 1970s (‘NS70’, sampling years 1971–1974), 404 samples from the 1980s (NS80, sampling years 1984–1985–1987) and 130 samples from 1995 (NS95) (For details on age composition
of the samples, see Table S2, Supporting information). In addition, contemporary samples were collected in 2007 during research surveys off the Thames, on the Norfolk Banks and off the Belgian Coast (Fig. 1).
Molecular analyses
DNA was extracted from the dried tissue covering the historical otoliths, using a protocol described in Cuveliers et al. (2009) and subsequently stored at )20 °C. For the contemporary samples of 2007, DNA was extracted from fin tissue using the Nucleospin Tissue Purification kit (Macherey-Nagel GmBH). Both historical and contemporary samples were genotyped at 11 loci (F8-ICA9, F8-ITG11, F13-II8 ⁄ 4 ⁄ 7; Iyengar et al. 2000); (Sos(AC)6, Sos(AC)20, Sos(AC)40, Sos(AC)30, Sos(AC)45; Garoia et al. 2006); SolCA13, SolGA12 (Porta & Alvarez 2004); SseGATA26 (Funes et al. 2004) on an automated capillary sequencer ABI 3130 AVANT (Applied Biosystems). Microsatellite markers were combined in three multiplex reactions. All PCRs were performed using a touchdown protocol. Details on the PCR conditions are presented in the Supporting Information (Table S1). Allele size was determined using an internal lane size standard (250LIZ) and the software GENEMAPPER 3.7 (Applied Biosystems). The software TANDEM v. 1.07 was used for automated allele binning (Matschiner & Salzburger 2009). All recommendations for working with historical collections of fishes as suggested by Nielsen & Hansen (2008) were implemented. To avoid contamination, all sample extractions and PCR reactions were carried out in a fish DNA free laboratory with filter

tips. Historical DNA was extracted under a laminar flow in a laboratory where no contemporary DNA work had been performed. Negative controls were included at all stages, and approximately 20% of all samples were re-amplified to check for reproducibility.
Data quality
The software MICROCHECKER 2.2.1 (van Oosterhout et al. 2006) was used to check for genotyping errors (null alleles, stuttering and large allele dropout). Null allele frequencies were estimated for each locus and population using the Expectation Maximization algorithm of Dempster et al. (1977), implemented in the software FREENA (Chapuis & Estoup 2007). All loci were tested for linkage disequilibrium with a permutation test in FSTAT v.2.9. (Goudet 2002). Deviations from Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium were tested by an exact test using a Markov Chain algorithm (Guo & Thompson 1992) in GENEPOP v. 4.0.10 (Raymond & Rousset 1995). Because Ne estimates assume purely genetic drift influences, we performed a neutrality test including all loci using the FST outlier method (fdist) of Beaumont & Nichols (1996), implemented in the software LOSITAN (Antao et al. 2008). A total of 95 000 simulations were computed for SMM with the options ‘neutral mean FST’ and ‘force mean FST’.
Spatial genetic variation
To avoid any bias on Ne estimates because of sampling location variation within the North Sea, we initially tested the genetic structure between geographically separated sampling locations. The level of spatial differentiation was first evaluated through comparison of the three samples from 2007, adjacent to three major spawning areas of the Norfolk Banks, the Belgian Coast and Thames estuary (Fig. 1) (Rijnsdorp et al. 1992). Spatial differentiation was further tested by comparing historical samples within a sampling year from different locations. All tests were carried out with global and pairwise FST (h) (Weir & Cockerham 1984) in GENETIX v. 4.05 (Belkhir et al. 2004) and Jost D estimate (Jost 2008) using the software SMOGD (Crawford 2010).
Temporal genetic variation
Given the large available data set in this study, differences in genetic diversity over the sampling period were evaluated using two approaches. First, genetic diversity was compared among sampling years, consisting of several year classes (mixed cohorts). Second, genetic diversity was compared among specific cohorts to analyse cohort-specific diversity. Only those cohorts with more than 28 individuals were retained.
To assess genetic diversity of each sample, observed (Ho) and unbiased expected (He) heterozygosity (Nei 1978) were calculated using GENETIX v. 4.05 (Belkhir et al. 2004). FSTAT v.2.9 (Goudet 2002) was used to calculate allelic richness (AR) (El Mousadik & Petit 1996) based on the smallest sample size for any locus. To test whether these measures of genetic diversity were significantly different among samples, they were compared for each locus with a nonparametric Friedman ANOVA (AR, He). Single and multilocus FIS estimates (Weir & Cockerham 1984) were calculated in GENETIX v. 4.05. Multilocus FST estimates (Weir & Cockerham 1984) were also estimated as a measure of temporal differentiation among samples. Significance levels were assessed through 1000 permutations and corrected for multiple tests using a Bonferroni test (Rice 1989).
Effective population size
There is currently no general consensus about which method performs best for larger populations (Fraser et al. 2007); hence, we evaluated three different Ne calculation methods to enable comparison with other (flat)fish studies [e.g. on plaice, Hoarau et al. (2005)]. Estimates of effective population size were initially calculated based on allele frequency differences among the temporal samples (mixed cohort design). First, the temporal method of Jorde & Ryman (2007) was applied to estimate variance effective population size based on the unbiased estimator Fs’. This method generally performs better than other temporal methods if allele frequencies are skewed, a common feature in microsatellite data (Luikart et al. 1998; Jorde & Ryman 2007). Calculations were made using the software TempoFs following ‘sample plan 2’ because individuals were sampled destructively before reproduction and were not returned to the population. In addition, Ne was calculated using the classical moment-based method of Waples (1989) and the pseudo-likelihood method of Wang (2001) (implemented in MNE v.1.0). The resulting long-term estimate (harmonic mean over the period 1957–2007) was compared with a temporal estimate over the first time interval (1950s–1960s) corresponding to a period with lower fishing pressure, and an estimate over the second time interval (1960s–2007) to explore temporal changes in effective population size in periods with an ever increasing fishing pressure. We also estimated Ne for each of the intermediate decades. Because we do not have information on possible external source populations and because data from all sampling locations were pooled (see Results section), the Ne estimate was based on the assumption of a closed population with Ne max set to 30 000 individuals. Finally, we compared Ne estimates based on temporal methods with single-sample esti-

mates based on a linkage disequilibrium method (LDNE; Waples & Do 2008), which is considered an estimator of inbreeding Ne (Luikart et al. 2010). The method estimates Ne of the parental generation based on the correlation among alleles at unlinked loci and corrects for downward bias because of small sample sizes. Confidence intervals were determined by jackknifing on loci and the allowed frequency of observed alleles was set at 0.05 (Waples & Do 2008) because alleles occurring at low frequencies may bias results (Waples 2006).
An important changing demographic parameter in harvested fish populations is the generation time (Tg), defined as the mean age of the parents (Hill 1979). This parameter is generally overlooked in other studies assessing effective population size, most likely resulting in an underestimation of population size because of an unaccounted increase in generation number between recent time intervals. Here, we corrected for such bias by calculating generation time using the estimates of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters, weight–length relationship, maturity–age relationship estimated from fish sampled during research vessel surveys and from landings of commercial fisheries (Mollet et al. 2007), relative fecundity estimates (Witthames et al. 1995b), natural and fishing mortality (ICES 2009). In sole, Tg has strongly decreased over the sampling period from 7.7 years in the 1950s to as low as 4.2 years in the 1990s (Fig. 2). These changes in life-history traits may have resulted from the increased size selective fishing mortality towards larger and older individuals (Jørgensen et al. 2007). Because of its high relevance when estimating the number of generations between temporal samples, the change in generation time was taken into account in the analyses by altering the generation time each decade according to Fig. 2. The mean estimated generation length over the whole study period was
4.9 years (average male and female), and the estimated number of generations between the first and last temporal sample was 10. The estimated number of generations during the first time interval (NS50–NS60) was only one generation, while the estimated number of generations for the second time interval (NS60–NS07) was nine generations (Table 2).
Estimates of Ne ⁄ Nc ratio
To evaluate the potential change in the relationship between census population size (Nc) and effective population size over the studied period of high harvesting pressure, we calculated Nc for the different time periods as the mean of the population numbers (age 3–10), as estimated by stock assessments (ICES 2009). The ratio Ne ⁄ Nc was then computed using the results of the Ne estimations for the corresponding time intervals to contrast the observed Ne ⁄ Nc ratio with the theoretical constant ratio.
Power analysis
To jointly evaluate the statistical power of our marker set for large Ne computations and to detect small temporal genetic differentiation between samples ⁄ cohorts, we applied a simulation approach implemented in POWSIM (Ryman & Palm 2006). The program simulates samples from multiple populations that have drifted apart a number of generations and calculates the expected FST and P-values for a given Ne assuming no mutation or migration. The null hypothesis of genetic homogeneity is tested with a Fisher exact test and a chi-square test. The proportion of significances (P < 0.05) represents an estimate of the power, while the error rate of rejecting Ho when it is true (type I error) is calculated using samples drawn directly from the base population without the drift (Ryman & Palm 2006). Power was assessed across 200 runs of 103 iterations each. To test the amount of drift that would be detectable with the number of loci (L = 11) and the sample size (N = 250) of our study, several simulations were carried out with varying Ne values and ten generations of drift. Next, simulations were performed to evaluate the number of loci and sample size necessary to detect population differences with an effective population size similar to the one observed in our study (Ne = 2000).

calculated with the algorithm of Dempster ranged from 0 to 0.28. MICROCHECKER and FREENA found evidence for null alleles at three loci: Sos(AC)30, Sos(AC)40 and Sos(AC)45. Therefore, all analyses were carried out with and without these loci. Because the exclusion of these loci did not have any significant influence on the outcome of the diversity analyses or Ne estimates and because a jackknife procedure did not indicate a large influence from any of these loci on temporal FST, we decided to keep the markers in the analyses in order not to lose statistical power. The test with LOSITAN confirmed selective neutrality for all microsatellite loci. The historical DNA was of sufficiently high quality to result in a PCR re-amplification success, ranging from 91% to 97%. Linkage equilibrium was met in all pairwise loci combinations after 1320 permutations.
Spatial variation
The global FST for the recent samples of 2007 did not point to any spatial differentiation (FST = )0.0006; P = 0.639; 95% CI: )0.00203 to 0.00110). None of the pairwise FST values were significantly different from zero (P > 0.59). Jost D estimate was also very small (Dest = 0.001), and all pairwise D estimates were equal to 0.001. In the following temporal analyses, the three samples were therefore pooled (‘NS07’). The geographical analysis of historical samples sampled in the same year also showed that there were no significant pairwise genetic differences among samples from the southern North Sea (FST ranging from )0.007 to 0.005, P > 0.083), indicating the lack of small-scale spatial influence on allele frequencies. Additionally, because the samples from the different sampling years were homogenously distributed across the study area, no confounding effects of geographic differentiation were expected. Genotypes across sampling locations were thus pooled by sampling year in order to provide a global Ne estimate for the North Sea.
Genetic diversity
Comparison of sampling years. Several loci and samples showed significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (significantly higher FIS than expected by chance) after Bonferroni correction (Table S3, Supporting Information). The highest prevalence of heterozygote deficiencies occurred at locus Sos(AC)30 and Sos(AC)40. Multilocus FIS values ranged from 0.09 (NS80) to 0.16 (NS60) and were all significant (Table 1). All loci were polymorphic with the number of alleles sampled ranging from 5 (Locus F8-ICA9) to 34 [Locus Sos(AC)20)]. There were no private alleles with a frequency >0.02. There were no indications of temporal

Average AR based on 88 individuals was similar in all temporal samples [ANOVA v2 (N = 11, d.f. = 5) = 4.766, P = 0.445]. Unbiased expected heterozygosity per locus ranged from 0.46 to 0.90 (Table S3, Supporting Information). Mean expected heterozygosity was 0.77 for all the historical samples (NS50–NS60–NS70–NS80–NS95) and was slightly higher in the contemporary samples (NS07: He = 0.78), but this difference was not significant [v2(N = 11, d.f. = 5) = 5.706, P = 0.336; Table 1].
Multilocus FST using the whole data set consisting of both historical and contemporary samples was 0.0005 (95% CI: 0.0000–0.0012) and not significantly different from zero (P = 0.290). Estimates of temporal genetic differentiation based only on the historical samples was FST = 0.0003 (95% CI: )0.00011–0.00090) and not significantly different from zero (P = 0.112).
Comparison of cohorts. Genetic diversity did not differ significantly among cohorts (Table 1). AR based on 20 individuals varied from 8.7 (cohort 1953) to 9.5 (cohort 1969), but showed no significant differences among cohorts [ANOVA v2(N = 11, d.f. = 12) = 15.704, P = 0.205].

cohorts (ranging from 0.759 to 0.787) [ANOVA v2(N = 11, d.f. = 12) = 12.979, P = 0.371]. Multilocus FIS values ranged from 0.07 (cohort 1979) to 0.18 (cohort 1950) and were almost all significant (Table 1). We could not detect any temporal differentiation among cohorts, with a multilocus FST of 0.0003 (95% CI: )0.00041 to 0.00099) not differing from zero (P = 0.299).
Effective population size
Estimates of long-term effective population size using temporal methods are listed in Table 2. Overall, there was great congruence between the Ne estimate for the three temporal methods. Estimation of the harmonic mean Ne over the whole period from 1957 (NS50) to 2007 (NS07) using the moment-based method of Waples (1989) was 2247 with a finite confidence interval (CI = 1126–8370). The pseudo-likelihood method of Wang (2001) resulted also in an estimate larger than 2000 (Ne = 2169) with a finite confidence interval (CI = 1221–5744). The method of Jorde & Ryman (2007) yielded an estimate of Ne = 4394, but with an upper confidence interval reaching infinity.
The Ne estimate for the first interval (NS50–NS60) was an order of magnitude lower than for the period after the 1960s (NS60–NS07), although the upper confidence limits ranged to infinity (Table 2). Lower confidence limits were very low and ranged from 80 (Jorde & Ryman 2007) to 319 (Wang 2001) for the first interval.
Ne estimates for the second period (NS60–NS07) was 1456 (Waples 1989), 2054 (Wang 2001) and infinity (Jorde & Ryman 2007). Both the temporal method of Waples (1989) and the pseudo likelihood method of Wang (2001) resulted in finite upper confidence limits exceeding 3000. The lower confidence limits for this time interval ranged from 799 to 2378.
Allele frequency changes (Fs’) were smaller, and thus, the Ne estimates were higher for the intermediate time
intervals with an increasing number of generations between the temporal points (Table 2).
The observation of a sensible increase in Ne with increasing number of generations between the temporal points highlights the importance of an accurate estimate of the generation time in sole and other marine species under heavy size-selective exploitation. If no correction is applied, the unnoticed decrease in generation time owing to an earlier age at maturation may lead to a severe under-estimation of the effective population size in genetic studies failing to integrate such demographic knowledge.
Single sample estimates of Ne (LDNE) for each of the sampling years separately were always larger than 1000 with very broad confidence intervals. Upper confidence limits were infinitely large in all years, and lower confidence limits ranged from 289 in NS50 to 1826 in NS70 (Table 3).
Estimates of Ne ⁄ Nc ratio
The mean census size Nc for the North Sea stock for the whole period (1957–2007) was estimated at 200 · 106 individuals (Table 2). The average census population size decreased drastically from 341 · 106 in the first time interval (1950–1960) to 145 · 106 in the last decade (1995–2007). With an estimate of Ne of around 2000, this results in an overall ratio Ne ⁄ Nc of 10)5 and a decrease of one order of magnitude between 1950 (10)6) and 2007 (10)5). However, the large uncertainties around some inferred Ne estimates, as revealed by the broad confidence intervals, make it difficult to determine with certainty the true ratio based on our data.

cient statistical power to detect the observed level of genetic differentiation, as a true FST of 0.001 (coinciding with an Ne = 5000) could be detected with a probability of 98% based on the observed allele frequencies at the 11 loci and with a sample size of 250 (Fig. 3).
The simulations further showed that a sample size of 80 was sufficient to obtain 88% probability of detecting genetic differences with an Ne = 2000 and 11 loci. There was no obvious effect of the number of loci with an effective population size of 2000 and a sample size of 250.
Discussion
Various changes in life-history traits have been observed in Solea solea in the North Sea over the last decade, with as most obvious the rapid decrease in age and size at first maturation linked to an increasing fishing pressure (Mollet et al. 2007). Since the end of the 1960s, fishing mortality has always exceeded the precautionary approach mortality of F = 0.4. In this study, we therefore tested the hypothesis that a continuous increase in fishing intensity should also be reflected in a detectable decrease in neutral genetic diversity of the stock and hence a reduction in effective population size.
To minimize potential bias because of unaccounted demographic changes, unequal sampling design and low sampling size, we compiled one of the largest archived data sets of a marine exploited fish so far, combining genetic analyses with crucial information on fishery pressure, cohort structure, shifts in generation time and simulations to estimate the power of detecting small but relevant drift effects.
Despite the decrease in spawning stock biomass of more than 50% since the late 1950s (ICES 2009) and the aforementioned indications for rapid phenotypic changes over ten generations of heavy fishing (50 years), we could not observe a long-term decrease in neutral genetic diversity (neither in AR nor expected heterozygosity) in North Sea sole between 1957 and 2007. In agestructured populations with overlapping generations, allele frequency fluctuations might occur because of the unequal participation of cohorts to reproduction. All cohorts in this study showed, however, similar levels of genetic diversity and the analyses failed to identify significant genetic differences between year classes.
Our results are in line with various other studies on heavily exploited marine fish also showing a stable temporal pattern of neutral diversity (Ruzzante 2001; Poulsen et al. 2006; Chevolot et al. 2008; Larsson et al.

2010; Therkildsen et al. 2010). Our data included samples from the 1950s, corresponding to a period of lower fishing mortality. Despite the different approaches used to explore temporal diversity, none of them indicated a clear change in genetic composition. Such results represent one of the main challenges in monitoring genetic changes in marine heavily exploited species composed of large open populations (Hauser & Carvalho 2008). In contrast to observed life-history traits shifts (selection acts much faster than drift in large populations) and diminishing census sizes, neutral diversity is most likely only lost substantially when marine populations are both very small and isolated (Nm < 1%) (Palstra & Ruzzante 2008). Inbreeding, recessive alleles and reduced adaptive potential then tend to speed up the extinction process. For marine species, the fishery would likely collapse economically before the population decreases down to the level when genetic drift becomes detectable (Boehlert 1996). The absence of changes in neutral genetic variation could simply be the consequence of the large effective population size, acting against the effects of genetic drift.
In line with a stable genetic diversity, the estimated Ne of sole for the period 1957–2007 was higher than 2000 individuals, with lower confidence boundaries higher than 1000. The Ne did not seem to decrease over the 50-year time period, regardless of the temporal methods used. Several of the estimated confidence intervals reached infinity. The broad confidence intervals show that, in species with high population sizes, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high Ne with many methods. This is because the sampling variance [1 ⁄ (sample size)] is much larger than the genetic drift per generation [1 ⁄ (2Ne)], resulting in a large noise-to-signal ratio (Poulsen et al. 2006; Luikart et al. 2010). Single-sample estimates all showed very broad confidence intervals, ranging from 289 to infinity. Lower confidence limits were lowest in the 1950s, maximal in the 1970s and decreased again after the 1970s, although the upper limits could never be distinguished from infinity. Linkage disequilibrium methods seem to perform poorly with large population sizes (>10 000) such as in sole (Tallmon et al. 2010).
The observed Ne estimate in sole suggests that on the one hand genetic drift is limited and did not really influence allele frequencies over the last 50 years or alternatively, that gene flow levels from neighbouring populations (such as the Bay of Biscay, English Channel, Skagerrak) are high enough to buffer for any loss of genetic variation (open metapopulation system). A combination of both processes is also possible. In theory, estimates of Ne > 1000 are sufficiently high to maintain high levels of genetic diversity (Ewens 1972), to
avoid deleterious effects of inbreeding depression and hence to maintain evolutionary potential (Frankham et al. 2002). However, these ‘rules of thumb’ should be regarded as rough guidelines, and some authors have argued that Ne values should be higher than 5000 to maintain evolutionary potential (Franklin & Frankham 1998). For a marine fish with highly variable reproductive success, an effective size of 2000 might be considered rather low and could easily drop down to an evolutionary unstable level, because of the synergy between anthropogenic selective pressures (fishing, habitat destruction, pollution and climate change). Moreover, the lower confidence boundaries of the estimates were in several instances lower than 1000.
Compared with the census estimates of sole (millions of fish), the obtained Ne estimates are indeed relatively small, which is also reflected in the low Ne ⁄ Nc ratio (10)5). However, we must note that the observed Ne ⁄ Nc ratio is also subject to substantial uncertainty. Given the broad confidence intervals of the Ne estimates, the true ratio remains hard to determine with certainty and should hence be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, a similar estimate of Ne ⁄ Nc was obtained for plaice, a flatfish mainly caught together with sole in a mixed fishery in the North Sea (Hoarau et al. 2005), but also for North Sea cod, the ratio was estimated at 10)5 (Hutchinson et al. 2003). Small Ne ⁄ Nc ratios are commonly observed in marine fish (Hauser et al. 2002; Poulsen et al. 2006; Chevolot et al. 2008; Larsson et al. 2010) and are mainly caused by the fluctuating population sizes, unequal sex ratio and the high variance in reproductive success resulting from a type III survivorship (Palstra & Ruzzante 2008). In North Sea sole, fluctuations in stock size are observed over the study period, caused by the occurrence of very strong and very weak year classes (Rijnsdorp et al. 1992; ICES 2010). Such fluctuations might decrease the Ne, but are less important for short-term estimates of Ne (across a few generations), unless a bottleneck has occurred (Hauser & Carvalho 2008). There is no evidence for biased sex ratio in North Sea sole. As in most marine fish, the primary factor causing the low Ne ⁄ Nc ratio in sole is most likely the large variability in reproductive success arising from variance in family reproductive success and variance in individual lifetime reproductive success (Hare et al. 2011). Fecundity in sole ranges from 200 000–450 000 eggs for a female of 35 cm (Witthames et al. 1995a), and larval mortality rates range from 10% to 50% per day (Horwood 2001). The combination of high fecundity and high mortalities early in life may result in sweepstakes recruitment, where most of the progeny are only from very few parents (Hedgecock 1994). Hence, high variance in individual reproductive success is likely.

Traditionally, it is assumed that a positive linear relation exists between the census size and effective size, leading to a stable Ne ⁄ Nc ratio for species (Frankham 1995). Although such a constant ratio would have a practical value in conservation, in many species the Ne ⁄ Nc ratio is not necessarily fixed and the relationship between Ne and Nc is better explained by a power function (Palstra & Ruzzante 2008). This means that the ratio might even increase with decreasing census sizes. Such a relative increase in Ne ⁄ Nc ratio was also observed for sole in our study, despite the broad confidence intervals observed around the estimated Ne as revealed by their wide confidence intervals, a common pattern in large highly variable marine species (Hare et al. 2011). Nevertheless, several nonexclusive hypotheses can be put forward to explain the increased Ne ⁄ Nc ratio in sole, while a combination thereof is also possible. First, a mechanism of genetic compensation acting against the negative genetic effects of low population numbers may exist (Palstra & Ruzzante 2008). Such a density-dependent relationship between Ne and Nc has been illustrated in empirical studies of fish and might be explained by the reduction of competition for mating partners or spawning sites at lower census sizes, leading to more equal reproductive output and a more balanced sex ratio (Ardren & Kapuscinski 2003; Araki et al. 2007). Second, the reproductive success in marine fish depends strongly on the larger and older females, producing more eggs of good quality (Chambers & Leggett 1996; Palumbi 2004; Wright & Trippel 2009); this is also true for sole (Horwood 2001; Rijnsdorp & Witthames 2004). The egg weight and size is also proportional to female size or age in several marine fish, with potential effects on larval viability and hence later fitness (Rijnsdorp & Vingerhoed 1994; Berkeley et al. 2004; Higashitani et al. 2007). The removal of those older and larger females by a size-selective fishery might give the many other, less productive females the opportunity of becoming ‘reproductive winners’. This might in its turn reduce the variance in reproductive success among families ⁄ individuals, increasing (or at least maintaining) the Ne and as such reducing the ratio Ne ⁄ Nc when Nc is strongly declining. Finally, as we accounted for a changing generation time (Tg) due to strong size selective fishery pressure when estimating the Ne in sole, the resulting higher Ne in recent decades than estimated with a stable Tg shifted the otherwise stable Ne ⁄ Nc ratio.
Besides the biological explanations for the observed low Ne ⁄ Nc in sole, caution is still advised about potential violation of assumptions underlying the Ne computation methods. The temporal methods applied here are developed for species with nonoverlapping generations and assume negligible immigration from other popula-
tions. For species with a type III survival such as sole, bias owing to overlapping generations would lead to underestimate Ne (Waples & Yokota 2007; Hare et al. 2011). Although the assumption of discrete generations is violated for sole, the longest time intervals (1957– 2007) in this study cover >9 generations minimizing the bias owing to overlapping generations (Waples & Yokota 2007). For the Ne estimates over the shortest time intervals separated by only one generation, age structure could be responsible for the lower values, although the upper confidence limits were infinitely large. We assumed North Sea sole to be a single (meta) population and that all temporal samples were taken from this population. Based on neutral genetic markers, there are no indications for population substructure at this spatial scale (Kotoulas et al. 1995; Exadactylos et al. 1998; Rolland et al. 2007). The assumption of no migration from outside the study area might have been violated in our study if gene flow (e.g. from the English Channel) actually did occur during the sampling period. An upward bias is expected if migration occurs from a genetically similar source, counteracting the effects of drift (Fraser et al. 2004). This is the most likely scenario for sole, because no genetic differences were found between sole from the English Channel and the North Sea (Cuveliers, unpublished data). Finally, technical errors because of mis-scoring or the presence of null alleles remain a concern in historical samples. Nevertheless, the analysis of Ne without the loci with high null allele frequencies yielded similar estimates. This was also shown in a study of Turner et al. (2002), indicating that Ne estimates were robust for the presence of null alleles.
A common problem in marine species genetic studies is the limited power to detect small genetic differentiation in time and space, owing to low sampling sizes, a low number of loci or strong interlocus variance (Waples 1998; Waples & Gaggiotti 2006; Hare et al. 2011). Simulation studies do, however, enable to exclude power issues for the lack of genetic drift signals and has been successfully applied here. The simulations indicated that subtle genetic differentiation owing to genetic drift alone was detectable with a number of loci and a sample size comparable to our study. Furthermore, with an effective population size of 2000 (as empirically estimated in our study), the number of loci did not greatly impact the differentiation power. Hauser & Carvalho (2008) described that under complete isolation and with an effective population size between 103 and 104 as observed in our study, only 10 generations are required to achieve an FST of 0.002.
Importantly, even though no apparent loss in neutral genetic diversity could be observed in sole, we must be cautious on concluding the absence of fishery effects on genetic diversity. Because of the low correlation

EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZE IN THE OVEREXPLOITED NORTH SEA SOLE 3565
between neutral diversity and quantitative variation (Reed & Frankham 2001), the possibility of an unnoticed decrease in adaptive genetic variation (underlying the observed life-history traits shifts) cannot be excluded, such as recently observed in Icelandic cod (Jakobsdo ́ttir et al. 2011). If the population is indeed large, it might be even more prone to the rapid effects of selection (natural or human-induced). For now, we can only conclude that the population size reduction because of overfishing has not yet reached the level to increase genetic drift drastically (assuming the absence of gene flow).
To conclude, our results do not point to any measurable changes in the level of neutral genetic diversity for Solea solea over the time period from 1957 to 2007 among consecutive cohorts or age groups, despite recently documented shifts in life-history traits over a period with a major increase in fishing intensity. The effective population size for sole is most likely larger than 2000, suggesting that genetic drift is not of major concern yet in this population, although in general the factors ruling this genetic parameter remain poorly known in marine species with a type III survival. The current stable neutral variation together with life-history trait data will serve as an ideal baseline data set to pick-up even slight footprints of selective anthropogenic pressure and to highlight the evolutionary consequences at the functional genomic level of overharvesting by humans.
