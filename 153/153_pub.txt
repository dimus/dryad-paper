Skinks of the genus Sphenomorphus are the most diverse clade of squamates in the Philippine Archipelago. 
Morphological examination of these species has defined six phenotypic groups that are commonly used in 
characterizations of taxonomic hypotheses. We used a molecular phylogeny based on four mitochondrial and two 
nuclear genes to assess the group’s biogeographical history in the archipelago and examine the phylogenetic 
validity of the currently recognized Philippine species groups. We re-examined traditional characters used to define 
species groups and used multivariate statistics to quantitatively evaluate group structure in morphometric space. 
Clustering analyses of phenotypic similarity indicate that some (but not all) members of previously defined species 
groups are phenotypically most similar to other members of the same group. However, when species group 
membership was mapped on our partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis, only one species group corresponds 
to a clade; all other species group arrangements are strongly rejected by our phylogeny. Our results demonstrate 
that (1) previously recognized species group relationships were misled by phenotypic convergence; (2) Sphenomorphus 
is widely paraphyletic; and (3) multiple lineages have independently invaded the Philippines. Based on 
this new perspective on the phylogenetic relationships of Philippine Sphenomorphus, we revise the archipelago’s 
diverse assemblage of species at the generic level, and resurrect and/or expand four previously recognized genera, 
and describe two new genera to accommodate the diversity of Philippine skinks of the Sphenomorphus group.

INTRODUCTION 
The majority of lizard species in the family Scincidae 
are found in the subfamily Lygosominae, which is 
divided into three groups (Greer, 1979). The Sphenomorphus 
group is one of the largest assemblages of 
squamates on earth, including approximately 30 
genera and 500 species defined by the shared presence 
of several morphological synapomorphies (Greer, 
1979). Of these, Sphenomorphus Fitzinger is the most 
species-rich genus (145 species) but the definition of 
this taxon remains enigmatic because of the lack of 
clear synapomorphies. Greer & Shea (2003) stated 
that ‘Sphenomorphus is undiagnosable and is almost 
certainly not monophyletic’ and Myers & Donnelly 
(1991) referred to Sphenomorphus as ‘a plesiomorphic 
taxon not at present definable by derived characters’. 
Originally named by Fitzinger (1843), Sphenomorphus 
was not recognized by Boulenger (1887) in his

section of Lygosoma by Smith (1937). Mittleman 
(1952) redefined Sphenomorphus as a genus based on 
the presence of large prefrontals, paired frontoparietals, 
enlarged precloacals, exposed auricular openings, 
and large limbs. Mittleman’s definition of the 
taxon is only slightly improved from Boulenger’s 
(1887) definition of Lygosoma, and only includes plesiomorphic 
characters. Since that time, the genus has 
been gradually partitioned, as new taxa defined by 
novel, apomorphic characters have been described 
(Ctenotus Storr, 1969; Eremiascincus Greer, 1979; 
Lankascincus Greer, 1991; Leptoseps Greer, 1997; Oligosoma 
Girard, 1857; Parvoscincus Ferner, Brown & 
Greer, 1997; Sigaloseps Sadlier, 1987). However, other 
genera (Otosaurus, Insulasaurus, Ictiscincus, Parotosaurus) 
have been combined with Sphenomorphus 
(Loveridge, 1948; Mittleman, 1952; Greer & Parker, 
1967). Although the composition of the genus has 
changed through time, species diversity remains high 
because of the lack of diagnostic characters, which 
has resulted in many new species being artificially 
assigned to Sphenomorphus. Currently, Sphenomorphus 
occur in South-East Asia, Asia, Indochina, and 
Central America. 
Two series of taxonomic revisions of Philippine Sphenomorphus 
provided an initial insight into the diversity 
of this assemblage. Taylor (1922a, b, c, 1923, 1925) 
recognized 19 species of Philippine forest skinks in the 
genera Otosaurus, Insulasaurus, and Sphenomorphus. 
In their review of Philippine scincids, Brown & Alcala 
(1980) followed Greer & Parker (1967) in placing 
Otosaurus and Insulasaurus in synonymy with Sphenomorphus. 
In addition, they synonymized several 
species recognized by Taylor and described four new 
species (reviewed by Brown et al., 2010). Six additional 
species were described (Brown, 1995; Brown et al., 
1999, 2010; Linkem, Diesmos & Brown, 2010a), and 
one species was moved to the genus Parvoscincus 
(Ferner et al., 1997). Twenty-eight endemic species are 
recognized as a result of these revisions and descriptions, 
making Sphenomorphus the most diverse squamate 
genus in the Philippines (Brown et al., 2010). 
TAXONOMY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY OF 
PHILIPPINE SPHENOMORPHUS 
Species diversity in the Philippines is intrinsically 
linked to the geological history of the region (Heaney, 
1985; Brown & Diesmos, 2001 (2002), 2009). The 
Philippine archipelago formed during the last 15 Myr 
as continental plate movement and volcanism caused 
the emergence of multiple large oceanic islands (Hall, 
1998). During low sea-level stands of the Pleistocene, 
islands separated by shallow channels were connected 
by land allowing for faunal and floral range 
expansion through dispersion and dispersal (Fig. 1: 
Brown & Guttman, 2002; Roberts, 2006a, b). These 
connected islands are often referred to as Pleistocene 
aggregate island complexes (PAICs). Species are commonly 
endemic to a single PAIC, although some 
species span multiple PAICs. Sphenomorphus 
atrigularis, Sphenomorphus beyeri, Sphenomorphus 
boyingi, Sphenomorphus diwata, Sphenomorphus 
hadros, Sphenomorphus igorotorum, 
Sphenomorphus kitangladensis, Sphenomorphus 
laterimaculatus, Sphenomorphus lawtoni, Sphenomorphus 
leucospilos, Sphenomorphus luzonensis, Sphenomorphus 
tagapayo, Sphenomorphus traanorum, 
Sphenomorphus wrighti, and Sphenomorphus victoria 
only occur on one island. Sphenomorphus acutus, 
Sphenomorphus arborens, Sphenomorphus bipartalis, 
Sphenomorphus fasciatus, Sphenomorphus llanosi, 
Sphenomorphus mindanensis, and Sphenomorphus 
variegatus are endemic to a single PAIC and can 
be found on multiple islands within that PAIC. 
Sphenomorphus abdictus, Sphenomorphus coxi, Sphenomorphus 
cumingi, Sphenomorphus decipiens, Sphenomorphus 
jagori, and Sphenomorphus steerei have 
widespread distributions occurring on more than one 
PAIC. 
In addition to the 28 endemic species, three species 
are partitioned into two subspecies: Sphenomorphus 
abdictus abdictus, Sphenomorphus abdictus aquilonius, 
Sphenomorphus coxi coxi, Sphenomorphus coxi 
divergens, Sphenomorphus jagori grandis and Sphenomorphus 
jagori jagori. These 31 taxonomic units are 
organized into six groups in the foundational work of 
Brown & Alcala (1980); although not created in a 
phylogenetic framework, these groups have served as 
convenient phenotypic categories for diagnoses of new 
species (e.g. Brown, Ferner & Greer, 1995; Ferner 
et al., 1997; Brown et al., 1999, 2010; Linkem, Diesmos 
& Brown, 2010a) and as the basis for hypotheses of 
evolutionary relationships (Linkem et al., 2010b). 
Each group is diagnosed by a combination of morphological 
features. Some Philippine groups are similar to 
Sphenomorphus species groups that occur outside of 
the Philippines (Greer & Parker, 1967). The species in 
each of the Brown & Alcala (1980) groups are summarized 
below. 
Group 1 Sphenomorphus are distinguished by moderate 
body size, high numbers of paravertebral scales 
(> 88), and a preference for high elevation, montane 
habitats (Table 1). Brown & Alcala (1980) placed two 
species in Group 1, Sphenomorphus beyeri and Sphenomorphus 
diwata, but a recent taxonomic revision 
(Brown et al., 2010) identified three additional species 
in this group – Sphenomorphus boyingi, Sphenomorphus 
hadros, and Sphenomorphus igorotorum. Most 
species in Group 1 are Luzon endemics, the only 
exception being Sphenomorphus diwata, which is 
restricted to eastern Mindanao (Fig. 1).

Group 2 comprises small species with small digits 
(Table 1). Brown & Alcala (1980) described Group 2 as 
‘a somewhat artificial assemblage’, but specified 
that Sphenomorphus atrigularis, Sphenomorphus 
lawtoni, and Sphenomorphus steerei were closely 
related, and that Sphenomorphus biparietalis was 
most similar to Sphenomorphus hallieri from Borneo. 
The authors also included Sphenomorphus luzonensis 
and Sphenomorphus palawanensis in Group 2. The 
discovery of Parvoscincus sisoni led to the transfer of 
Sphenomorphus palawanensis to the genus Parvoscincus 
(Ferner et al., 1997). As the two species of Parvoscincus 
resemble Group 2 species morphologically, 
we conditionally consider them as members of this 
group for the purpose of this review of phenotypic 
variation. The most recent species added to Group 2 
was Sphenomorphus tagapayo (Brown et al., 1999); 
giving a total of eight species in Group 2. Most species 
in this group have limited distributions, with Sphenomorphus 
lawtoni, Sphenomorphus luzonensis, and 
Sphenomorphus tagapayo occurring only in limited 
regions of Luzon Island; Sphenomorphus atrigularis in 
western Mindanao; Sphenomorphus biparietalis in the 
Sulu Archipelago; Parvoscincus palawanensis on 
Palawan Island; and Parvoscincus sisoni on Panay 
Island. Sphenomorphus steerei ranges throughout the 
archipelago. 
Group 3 consists of small-to-intermediate-sized, 
slender-bodied species with midbody scale rows 30–40, 
and lamellae beneath toe IV 15–20 (Table 1). Group 3 
was considered most similar to Bornean Sphenomorphus 
murudensis and Sphenomorphus kinabaluensis, 
which are part of the Greer & Parker (1967) Sphenomorphus 
variegatus group. Brown & Alcala (1980) partitioned 
Philippine species of Greer & Parker’s (1967) 
Sphenomorphus variegatus group into Groups 3 and 4 
(see below) based on the ratio of midbody scale rows to 
lamellae beneath toe IV, which were on average fewer 
in Group 3 species than Group 4 species. Brown & 
Alcala (1980) placed the following species in Group 
3: Sphenomorphus leucospilos, Sphenomorphus mindanensis, 
Sphenomorphus victoria, Sphenomorphus 
laterimaculatus, and Sphenomorphus acutus. Sphenomorphus 
acutus does not fit into any of Brown & 
Alcala’s (1980) groups, but resembles Groups 3 and 4, 
and was placed in Group 3 by Brown & Alcala (1980). 
The Group 3 species occur in disparate parts of 
the archipelago, with Sphenomorphus laterimaculatus 
and Sphenomorphus leucospilos occurring on Luzon 
Island, Sphenomorphus victoria on Palawan Island, 
and Sphenomorphus mindanensis and Sphenomorphus 
acutus broadly distributed on Mindanao, Samar, 
and Leyte. Since Brown & Alcala’s (1980) review, 
Brown (1995) described another Group 3 species, Sphenomorphus 
kitangladensis, from eastern Mindanao 
(Brown, 1995). 
Brown & Alcala’s (1980) Group 4 contains most 
Philippine members of Greer & Parker’s (1967) Sphenomorphus 
variegatus group, defined by midbody 
scale rows 36–54 and lamellae beneath toe IV 20–28 
(Table 1). This group includes the following species: 
Sphenomorphus arborens, Sphenomorphus cumingi, 
Sphenomorphus decipiens, Sphenomorphus variegatus, 
and Sphenomorphus wrighti. A new species was 
recently described in Group 4 – Sphenomorphus 
traanorum (Linkem, Diesmos & Brown, 2010a). Two 
Group 4 species are widespread in the archipelago, 
Sphenomorphus cumingi and Sphenomorphus decipiens. 
The others have more limited distributions, with 
Sphenomorphus wrighti and Sphenomorphus traanorum 
occurring on Palawan Island, Sphenomorphus 
arborens on Negros, Panay, and Masbate, and 
Sphenomorphus variegatus on Mindanao, Samar, 
Leyte, and Bohol. 
Brown &Alcala’s (1980) Group 5 was the only group 
that the authors considered a natural assemblage. It 
includes large [snout–vent length (SVL) > 53 mm] 
species with midbody scale rows 32–44, and > 20 toe IV 
subdigital lamellae (Table 1). Brown & Alcala (1980) 
placed Sphenomorphus abdictus abdictus, Sphenomorphus 
abdictus aquilonius, Sphenomorphus jagori 
grandis, Sphenomorphus jagori jagori, Sphenomorphus 
coxi coxi, Sphenomorphus coxi divergens, and 
Sphenomorphus llanosi in this group. Linkem et al. 
(2010b) corroborated the monophyly of Group 5, but 
demonstrated that many of the species and subspecies 
within the group do not correspond to the clades 
identified in phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial 
DNA sequence data, thereby suggesting the need for a 
comprehensive review. 
Brown & Alcala’s (1980) Group 6 was considered a 
member of Greer & Parker’s (1967) Sphenomorphus 
fasciatus group and contains only one species, Sphenomorphus 
fasciatus, found on Mindanao, Bohol, 
Camiguin Sur, Dinagat, Samar, and Leyte Islands. 
Here we test whether Brown &Alcala’s cohesive and 
largely unchallenged phenotypic groupings represent 
natural assemblages (see also Brown et al., 1995, 
2010). First, we assess whether there is statistically 
significant phylogenetic support for the morphological 
species classifications of Brown & Alcala (1980). We 
then determine whether these supraspecific assemblages 
are natural monophyletic groups or whether 
these apparently cohesive phenotypic clusters of taxa 
represent instances of morphological convergence. In 
the context of these broad goals, we address three 
specific questions. (1) Are the morphologically cohesive, 
phenotypically defined species groups of Brown & 
Alcala (1980) natural, monophyletic units or has 
convergent evolution obscured and confounded our 
understanding of evolutionary trends in Philippine 
Sphenomorphus? (2) Are Philippine Sphenomorphus

species derived from a single common ancestor, or is 
this diversity the product of multiple invasions from 
Asian and/or Papuan sources? (3) Is our current understanding 
of Sphenomorphus species diversity accurate 
(28 species), or is species diversity as grossly underestimated 
as suggested by recent studies (Brown et al., 
2010; Linkem et al., 2010b)? 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
TAXON SAMPLING 
To adequately examine the relationships amongst 
Philippine Sphenomorphus, we included 131 samples 
of lygosomine skinks, representing 64 described 
species (Appendix). Sampling was predominantly 
from the Sphenomorphus group (53 species), with 
representatives from the Eugongylus (six species) and 
Mabuya groups (five species). We also incorporated 
representatives from the ‘Scincinae’ genus Plestiodon 
(Plestiodon anthracinus, Plestiodon fasciatus, and 
Plestiodon quadrilineatus), and from the families 
Xantusiidae (Xantusia vigilis) and Lacertidae (Tachydromus 
sexilineatus). 
We included samples from the following Sphenomorphus 
group genera: Lipinia, Papuascincus, Parvoscincus, 
Scincella, Glaphyromorphus, Eulamprus, 
Eremiascincus, and Hemiergis. The latter four genera 
are part of the Australian clade of the Sphenomorphus 
group, which is an assemblage of 15 genera 
previously shown to be well supported (Reeder, 2003; 
Rabosky et al., 2007; Skinner, 2007). We did not 
include all of the previously published data for this 
Australian clade because previous studies have found 
it to have high support, although these analyses 
lacked adequate outgroup sampling. We ran preliminary 
analyses (not shown) of our sampling in combination 
with all the Australian clade genera and found 
that the Australian clade maintained high support. 
Thus, we excluded members of the Australian clade to 
reduce the computational burden associated with this 
large data set. 
We collected 27 of the 28 currently recognized 
species of Philippine Sphenomorphus and included 
samples of the three subspecies for a total of 30 
taxonomic units sampled from the archipelago. We 
could not sample the species Sphenomorphus biparietalis 
because it occurs in the Sulu Archipelago, a 
region inaccessible to researchers. Similarly, Parvoscincus 
palawanensis has not been observed by 
researchers since its original collection and no 
genetic samples are available. For two widespread 
species (Sphenomorphus decipiens and Sphenomorphus 
steerei), we incorporated samples from multiple 
populations to maximize geographical coverage across 
known biogeographical boundaries such as mountain 
ranges and marine channels (Brown & Diesmos, 
2001 (2002), 2009). Sampling comprised each 
of the 11 clades of the Sphenomorphus abdictus– 
Sphenomorphus coxi–Sphenomorphus jagori complex 
of Linkem et al. (2010b). We included available non- 
Philippine Sphenomorphus from Borneo, Sulawesi, 
Indochina, China, the Solomon Islands, Central 
America, and Palau (Appendix). Sampling for Sphenomorphus 
and the Sphenomorphus group was far 
from inclusive, but was sufficient to address the questions 
that were the focus of this study. 
MORPHOLOGICAL DATA AND ANALYSES 
Brown & Alcala (1980) based their morphological 
groupings on a combination of (1) snout–vent length, 
(2) number of scales around the mid-body, (3) paravertebral 
scales, and (4) subdigital lamellae of the fourth 
toe of the right foot (Table 1). As we sought to determine 
whether Brown & Alcala’s classification reflects 
natural phenotypic variation in the characters that 
vary amongst Philippine Sphenomorphus, we measured 
and counted the same characters on adults for 
all species of Philippine Sphenomorphus (see Brown 
et al., 2010 for a list of specimens examined). Scale 
counts, except mid-body scale rows, were taken on the 
right side of the body and the average value of each 
species was used for subsequent multivariate analyses 
(Table 2). Morphological data were analysed in 
the R statistical package and in JMP8 (SAS Institute 
Inc.). We used the unweighted pair group method 
with arithmetic mean (UPGMA: Sokal & Michner, 
1958) to create a phenogram of the morphological 
characters. Principal components analysis (PCA) was 
conducted using a correlation matrix on the raw scale 
counts for midbody scale rows and subdigital lamellae 
and log-transformed paravertebral scale rows and 
snout–vent length. Log-transformation was needed 
for the last two variables to achieve a normal distribution. 
The use of a correlation matrix standardized 
the variables with a zero mean and unit standard 
deviation, which is important when variables are not 
all of the same scale. 
GENE CHOICE AND DATA COLLECTION 
Tissue samples were extracted using a guanidine 
thiocyanate protocol modified from the PureGene protocol 
(Esselstyn, Timm & Brown, 2009, based on a 
protocol developed by M. Fujita, pers. comm.). Each 
extraction was amplified for the genes of interest 
(Table 3) through standard PCR protocols (Palumbi, 
1996). PCR products were purified with ExoSAPit 
(USB corp.) with a 20% dilution of stock ExoSAPit, 
incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then 80 °C for 
15 min. Cleaned PCR products were dye-labelled

using Big-Dye terminator 3.1 (Applied Biosystems), 
purified using Sephadex (NC9406038, Amersham 
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and sequenced on an 
ABI 3730 automated capillary sequencer. Raw 
sequence data were processed using SEQUENCING 
ANALYSIS software (Applied Biosystems). Individual 
sequence chromatograms were examined in 
SEQUENCHER v. 4.2 and individual single-stranded 
fragments were assembled into contiguous consensus 
reads for subsequent analysis. Consensus sequences 
for each individual for each gene were aligned using 
MUSCLE v. 3.6 (Edgar, 2004) with default settings. 
By-eye adjustment of alignments and verification of 
coding frame was carried out in Se-Al v.2.0a11 (http:// 
tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal). RNA alignments were 
adjusted to maintain correct secondary structure 
based on the structure profile of skinks in Brandley, 
Schmitz & Reeder (2005). 
We chose a variety of mitochondrial and nuclear 
genes to estimate the phylogeny of this group 
(Table 3). We sequenced the mitochondrial genes 
Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase 
subunit 2 (ND2: 1095 bp) and subunit 4 (ND4: 
705 bp), and ribosomal 12S (447 bp) and 16S (518 bp) 
genes as well as two nuclear genes, nerve growth 
factor beta polypeptide (NGFB: 567 bp) and RNA 
fingerprint protein 35 (R35: 689 bp). These genes 
were sequenced for the majority of our novel samples 
(Appendix), although some sample and gene combinations 
could not be amplified and were coded as

missing data in the matrix. We did not have samples 
of the Australian group taxa and could therefore only 
include previously published data, which is limited to 
12S, 16S, and ND4. Simulation and empirical studies 
have suggested that robust estimates of phylogeny 
can still be obtained despite the presence of missing 
data, especially when many characters are sampled 
(Wiens, 2003; Philippe et al., 2004; Wiens & Moen, 
2008). As a result, we are not concerned about the 
missing data in our data set affecting our estimate of 
phylogeny. 
All data are available on GenBank (JF497855– 
JF498576) and alignments can be downloaded from

GENE CONCATENATION, PARTITIONING STRATEGY, 
MODEL CHOICE, AND PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES 
Our mitochondrial gene sampling is very similar to 
other studies on skinks, allowing us to make some 
assumptions in regard to concatenation and partitioning. 
In addition to two mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S) 
used in Brandley et al. (2005), we sequenced ND2 and 
ND4, which have been informative in Sphenomorphus 
group skinks (Reeder, 2003; Linkem et al., 2010b). We 
assumed that these mitochondrial genes share a 
single evolutionary history as a result of matrilineal 
inheritance and the lack of recombination of the mitochondrion. 
Brandley et al. (2005) found that the best 
partitioning strategy for mitochondrial genes was to 
partition by gene, codon, and ribosomal secondary 
structure. We therefore concatenated our mitochondrial 
genes following the partitioning strategy of 
Brandley et al. (2005) for an 11 partition mitochondrial 
data set. The nuclear genes we sampled have 
not been used in skink phylogenetics, so we tested 
whether they should be partitioned by codon or 
analysed as a continuous gene. We analysed each 
gene in MrModelTest v2.2 (Nylander, 2004) to estimate 
the best-fit nucleotide substitution model, using 
the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the 
appropriate model. When multiple models had similar 
scores, we chose the most parameter-rich model 
within ten AIC units of the best AIC model (Table 4). 
We assumed that partitions within genes (codons and 
ribosomal secondary structure) have the same overall 
model as the entire gene because simulations have 
shown that choosing the correct model may be difficult 
with a few hundred characters (Posada & Crandall, 
2001). 
In order to combine the nuclear and mitochondrial 
data we tested for statistically significant incongruent 
phylogenetic relationships amongst the gene trees to 
ensure that each gene tracks the same evolutionary 
history. We conducted partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic 
analyses using MrBayes v. 3.2 (Huelsenbeck & 
Ronquist, 2001) of each nuclear gene and the mitochondrial 
data set separately. Each data set was run 
with four independent analyses for 20 million generations 
sampling every 1000 generations. Partitioned 
Bayesian analyses were completed with rates across 
partitions unlinked and the prior on branch lengths 
adjusted to exponential base 100 (Marshall, Simon & 
Buckley, 2006; Marshall, 2010). Chain convergence on 
the same posterior distribution was assessed using 
TRACER v. 1.5 (Rambaut & Drummond, 2007) andAre 
We There Yet (AWTY: Wilgenbusch, Warren & Swofford, 
2004; Nylander et al., 2007). The compare function 
in AWTY was used to ensure split frequencies 
were similar across separate runs, ensuring topological 
congruence. Majority rule consensus topologies of 
the posterior distributions from the multiple runs were 
summarized using the ‘sumt’ command in MrBayes v. 
3.2. We found no statistically significant incongruent

phylogenetic relationships amongst gene trees (Posterior 
Probability  0.95; Huelsenbeck&Rannala, 2004) 
so we combined the nuclear and mitochondrial genes 
into a single data set for subsequent phylogenetic 
analysis. 
Our combined data set was analysed with two different 
partitioning schemes, varying the partitioning 
of the nuclear data: P14, nuclear genes partitioned by 
codon; P17 nuclear genes partitioned by gene and 
codon (Table 5). We compared these partitioning 
strategies using Bayes factors (Nylander et al., 2004; 
Brandley et al., 2005). Analyses of the combined data 
used the same protocol as the individual genes mentioned 
above. All four analyses of the combined data 
sets for each partitioning strategy converged on 
the same posterior distribution within two million 
generations. 
TESTING ALTERNATIVE PHYLOGENETIC HYPOTHESES 
We used a Bayesian approach to test alternative 
phylogenetic relationships not represented in our consensus 
tree. We calculated a 95% credibility set of 
unique trees in the posterior distribution using the 
sumt command in MrBayes. We rejected the alternative 
phylogenetic hypothesis if it was absent from any 
tree in the 95% credible set. 
RESULTS 
MORPHOLOGICAL GROUPS 
Our statistical analyses of the four morphological 
variables used by Brown &Alcala (1980) corresponded 
to most of their phenotypic groupings (Fig. 2). Each of 
Groups 1, 2, and 5 form morphological clusters in the 
UPGMA tree, equivalent to the findings of Brown & 
Alcala (1980). Groups 3 and 4 did not form morphological 
clusters; however, this seems to reflect the 
morphological divergence of Sphenomorphus acutus 
and Sphenomorphus cumingi (Fig. 2). Morphological 
clustering places these two species as morphologically 
divergent from all other Philippine Sphenomorphus. 
The other species that do not fit within morphological 
clusterings of Group 3 and 4 are Sphenomorphus 
traanorum, which Linkem, Diesmos & Brown (2010a) 
placed in Group 4, and Sphenomorphus decipiens, 
which Brown & Alcala considered part of Group 4. 
Morphological variation of the four variables was 
summarized with PCA (Table 6). Most of the variation 
among species is explained by size (69%). Principal

component 2 explains 22% of the morphological variation 
and is primarily a shape axis of variation in 
paravertebral scales and midbody scale rows in relation 
to size. Groups 1, 2, and 5 are separated by PC axis 
1 and moderately separate on PC axis 2 (shape). 
Groups 3 and 4 have a region of broad overlap, with 
most of the variation for Group 4 being the result of 
size and that of Group 3 the result of shape. Group 6 
falls within Group 4. The range of variation for Group 
4 would be smaller if the outlying point at the far right 
of PC1 was not included. This point is represented by 
the very large species Sphenomorphus cumingi. Similarly, 
Group 3 would be more compact if the morphologically 
disparate species Sphenomorphus acutus was 
not included. Comparing the morphological species 
classifications mapped onto the PCA plot and our best 
estimate of phylogeny, it is clear that the morphologically 
cohesive phenotypic classifications of Brown & 
Alcala (1980) are predominated by evolutionary convergence, 
with the only exception being Group 5, which 
is monophyletic. 
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETIC RESULTS 
We did not find any incongruent clades above 95% 
posterior probability between the nuclear and mitochondrial 
gene trees. Therefore, we concatenated the 
data into one matrix totalling 4096 nucleotides, in 
which 155 characters were ambiguous to align and 
excluded (from 12S and 16S). Each partition was 
fitted to its best-fit model of evolution and summarized 
for number of parsimony informative characters, 
number of invariant characters, and number of 
uninformative characters (Table 4). 
We performed two different partitioning strategy 
analyses on the full data set, one with the nuclear 
genes partitioned by gene and codon (P17) and the 
other with the nuclear genes partitioned by codon 
position (P14: Table 5). Bayes factor comparisons 
demonstrated that the more partitioned model is the 
best model of evolution. Our preferred phylogenetic 
tree is therefore based on the analysis of the full, 
17-partition model (Table 5). 
The resulting consensus tree from the Bayesian 
phylogenetic analyses of the fully partitioned data set 
has high ( 0.95) posterior probability for almost all 
nodes (Fig. 2). This includes support for Lygosominae 
and the Sphenomorphus group. Other, non- 
Sphenomorphus genera in the Sphenomorphus group 
included in this study render Sphenomorphus paraphyletic; 
these include Scincella, Lipinia, Papuascincus, 
Parvoscincus, and the genera from the diverse 
radiation of Australian skinks of the Sphenomorphus 
group (Eremiascincus, Eulamprus, Glaphyromorphus, 
Hemiergis). 
Philippine Sphenomorphus are more diverse phylogenetically 
than originally expected, with multiple 
highly divergent and independent clades defined 
here. One large radiation is represented by 19 of the 
28 species found in the Philippines (Fig. 3, clade I). 
This diverse assemblage is in a polytomy with the 
Australian Sphenomorphus group radiation and with 
Sphenomorphus cumingi. Outside of this large Philippine 
clade, other Philippine species of Sphenomorphus 
are dispersed throughout the tree, all 
representing separate invasions of the Philippines. 
Sphenomorphus atrigularis, for example, is nested 
within a clade of species from Borneo, Sulawesi, and 
peninsular Malaysia. Sphenomorphus variegatus is 
nested within a clade of Bornean species. Sphenomorphus 
arborens, Sphenomorphus wrighti, Sphenomorphus 
traanorum, and Sphenomorphus victoria are 
related to Lipinia, which is a widespread genus in 
South-East Asia, and Papuascincus, a genus found on 
Papua New Guinea. Sphenomorphus fasciatus is 
nested within a clade of species from Papua New 
Guinea and the Solomon Islands. These separate 
clades represent six invasions of the Philippines, 
which occurred primarily via the western island arc of 
the Philippines.

1991; Greer & Shea, 2003). When morphological novelties, 
or derived apomorphic character differences, 
were found within species assigned to Sphenomorphus, 
the taxa were recognized as different genera 
(e.g. Greer, 1979, 1991, 1997; Greer & Simon, 1982; 
Ferner et al., 1997). Our results suggest that these 
morphological novelties represent multiple evolutionary 
transitions from a generalized plesiomorphic 
ancestor, repeated independently throughout the 
range and evolutionary history of the Sphenomorphus 
group. One such example involves the transition from 
a scaly lower eyelid to a transparent ‘window’ in the 
lower eyelid. Within our sampling the transparent 
‘window’ is found in Lipinia, Scincella, and Papuascincus 
(clades C and D). It is also found in Sphenomorphus 
assatus and northern populations of Sphenomorphus 
cherriei; however southern populations of 
Sp. cheerei have a scaly eyelid. Clade E is nested 
within this group of transparent ‘window’ taxa, but 
the taxa in clade E have the plesiomorphic state of a 
scaly eyelid. As Sphenomorphus cherriei and clade E 
both have the plesiomorphic state, there are two 
equally parsimonious reconstructions of this character 
within these taxa, one requiring two reversals to 
the plesiomorphic state and one requiring a convergence 
of the derived character with one reversal. 
These convergences and reversals of complex characters 
have contributed to the complexity of taxonomic 
and historical evaluations of the Sphenomorphus 
group. 
In the case of Brown & Alcala’s (1980) taxonomic 
groups, it seems that the characters employed 
for most of the groups have evolved convergently, 
having arisen in multiple clades; therefore, 
their groupings based on those characters do 
not reflect phylogenetic history (Fig. 2). The 
one exception is the Sphenomorphus abdictus– 
Sphenomorphus coxi–Sphenomorphus jagori complex, 
Group 5, which corresponds to a clade. 
It is not surprising that the phenotypic assemblages 
of Brown & Alcala (1980) do not correspond to phylogenetic 
clades as Brown & Alcala (1980) emphasized 
the doubtful phylogenetic validity of the groups they 
defined. Nevertheless, their identification of diagnostic 
characters has proven effective for identifying and 
describing new species. We have shown that Brown & 
Alcala’s (1980) species groups do form phenotypically 
defined statistical clusters, but that they are not 
necessarily the most closely related congeners. Our 
results therefore suggest that the characters used to 
define phenotypic assemblages in Philippine Sphenomorphus 
are convergent within the archipelago. 
Similarly, our results indicate that changes in body 
size have occurred repeatedly in Philippine Sphenomorphus. 
Our results suggest that small body 
size evolved early within clade K (Sphenomorphus 
steerei, Sphenomorphus decipiens, Parvoscincus 
sisoni, Sphenomorphus lawtoni, Sphenomorphus 
leucospilos, Sphenomorphus luzonensis, Sphenomorphus 
tagapayo) of Philippine species, with a later 
reversal to increased body size, forming a group of 
‘giant-dwarfs’ (Sphenomorphus beyeri, Sphenomorphus 
hadros, Sphenomorphus igorotorum, Sphenomorphus 
boyingi, Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens sp. 4, 
and Sphenomorphus laterimaculatus). All of these 
‘giant-dwarf’ taxa have proportionally more scales 
than other Sphenomorphus in the Philippines – a fact 
that may be explained by scales being proportionally 
smaller in miniaturized Sphenomorphus (C. W. 
Linkem, pers. observ.) and an increase in scale 
number as body size increases (Greer & Parker, 
1974). We speculate the increase in body size may 
have been necessary for the shift to high-elevation, 
moist cloud forest inhabited by the group of ‘giantdwarfs’ 
on Luzon. 
GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS OF 
SPECIES RELATIONSHIPS 
Biogeographical relationships found in Philippine 
Sphenomorphus represent novel patterns never 
before inferred by phylogenetic analyses of other Philippine 
vertebrate taxa (Brown & Diesmos, 2009; 
Esselstyn et al., 2009). In particular, our results 
unequivocally demonstrate that the complex southern 
and western Philippine communities of forest skinks 
are assembled from multiple regions of South-East 
Asia and the Papuan realm (Fig. 3). The finding 
that these separate invasions primarily have been 
restricted to clades occupying the south-western 
portion of the archipelago is expected given the geographically 
proximate potential sources of dispersal 
(Inger, 1954; Brown & Alcala, 1970). Invasions seem 
to have originated from different directions, including 
two potential invasions from Borneo into Mindanao 
(Sphenomorphus atrigularis, and Sphenomorphus 
variegatus), one potential invasion from an unknown 
source into Palawan and Panay (Sphenomorphus arborens, 
Sphenomorphus traanorum, Sphenomorphus 
victoria, Sphenomorphus wrighti), and one potential 
invasion from the New Guinea faunal region into 
Mindanao (Sphenomorphus fasciatus). Sphenomorphus 
variegatus was conspecific with Sphenomorphus 
multisquamatus, Sphenomorphus sabanus, and Sphenomorphus 
simus (Inger, 1958), the first two species, 
sampled in this study, are from Borneo, the latter is 
not sampled and is from Papua New Guinea. We infer 
that Sphenomorphus variegatus is derived from 
Borneo, but future sampling of Sphenomorphus simus 
may show this to be incorrect. The largest clade 
(Clade I) of Philippine species forms a polytomy with 
the diverse Australian Sphenomorphus group radia-

tion and with another Philippine species, Sphenomorphus 
cumingi. This finding is biogeographically 
unexpected and may be a result of our missing-taxon 
sampling from Papua New Guinea and/or Indonesia, 
or of our phylogenetic misplacement because of our 
limited gene sampling of the Australian taxa. Outside 
of the Philippine taxa, clades tend to be geographically 
restricted, with the caveat that our sampling is 
taxonomically sparse in these regions (Fig. 3). Additional 
clades identified in our analysis include: Clade 
A of Malaysia, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Mindanao 
species; Clade B of Indochina, Borneo, and Mindanao 
species; Clade F of Papuan and Mindanao species; 
Clade G of Australian species; and Clade I of Philippine 
species. 
It is clear that some Philippine Sphenomorphus 
have evolved from multiple independent origins. Only 
two clades (E, I) show signs of within-archipelago 
speciation, with Clade I diversifying to a much 
greater extent than Clade E. The species in Clade E 
are located on the Visayan PAIC (Panay, Negros, 
Masbate, Guimaras) and on Palawan Island. The 
islands of the Visayan PAIC and Palawan are geographically 
distant, with more than 150 km of intervening 
open water. 
In a recent paper Blackburn et al. (2010) presented 
the ‘Palawan Ark Hypothesis’ and the supposition 
that the portion of the island arc now consisting of 
Palawan, southern Mindoro, and northern Panay was 
potentially emergent for the last 30 million years as it 
drifted south-east from continental Asia. Clade E 
Sphenomorphus on Panay and Palawan present a 
possible extension of this hypothesis, although lack of 
fossil calibrations prevents reliable divergence time 
estimation. Our current taxon sampling makes it 
difficult to infer if clade E is closely related to the 
species in Asia, Borneo, or elsewhere in South-East 
Asia. Clade I shows some biogeographical patterns 
similar to those seen in other Philippine animals 
(Heaney, 1985; Kennedy et al., 2000; Brown & 
Diesmos, 2001 (2002), 2009), with speciation events 
occurring across PAIC boundaries, although there are 
many speciation events within PAICs. The biogeography 
of Clade H is discussed in detail by Linkem et al. 
(2010b). Generally, widespread species in Clade H do 
not conform to PAIC predictions and there are multiple 
instances of divergent clades within a species 
occurring sympatrically. On Luzon Island, there are 
multiple instances of speciation on the island within 
Clade K – cases of potential allopatry across mountain 
ranges. The most obvious example of this is the 
clade of Sphenomorphus beyeri, Sphenomorphus 
boyingi, Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens sp. 4, Sphenomorphus 
hadros, Sphenomorphus igorotorum, and 
Sphenomorphus laterimaculatus. All of these species 
are high-elevation endemics found on different mountain 
ranges on Luzon (Brown et al., 2010). The 
Sphenomorphus decipiens complex may be another 
example, but the putative new species have not yet 
been described.
SPECIES RELATIONSHIPS 
This study confirms a long-held suspicion of researchers 
interested in the relationships of skinks of the 
Sphenomorphus group – viz., that the genus Sphenomorphus 
is widely paraphyletic with respect to a 
number of lygosomine taxa (Greer & Shea, 2003; 
Honda et al., 2003; Reeder, 2003). Nevertheless, the 
degree of paraphyly is surprising given that every 
genus of the Sphenomorphus group sampled is nested 
within Sphenomorphus sensu lato. One explanation 
for this problem is that Sphenomorphus was never 
properly defined with diagnostic characters (Myers & 
Donnelly, 1991; Greer & Shea, 2003). Thus, species 
were placed in the genus if they possessed generalized 
plesiomorphic character states or if their phylogenetic 
affinities were unclear (Grismer, Ahmad & Onn, 
2009). 
Clade A is a group of small skinks represented here 
by Sphenomorphus aesculeticola, Sphenomorphus 
parvus, Sphenomorphus hallieri, and Sphenomorphus 
atrigularis. These leaf-litter specialists occur in 
Borneo, Sulawesi, Borneo, and Mindanao, respectively. 
When describing Sphenomorphus aesculeticola, 
Inger et al. (2001) hypothesized that it was most 
closely related to the Philippine species Sphenomorphus 
atrigularis, Sphenomorphus biparietalis, and 
Sphenomorphus luzonensis, the Bornean species 
Sphenomorphus buettikoferi and Sphenomorphus 
hallieri, and the Malaysian species Sphenomorphus 
malayanus and Sphenomorphus butleri. As we lack 
samples of Sphenomorphus buettikoferi, Sphenomorphus 
malayanus, and Sphenomorphus butleri, we 
cannot comment on the relationships of those species, 
but the others are closely related, except Sphenomorphus 
luzonensis. Recently, numerous small, diminutive 
species have been described from Malaysia 
(Grismer, 2006, 2007a, b; Grismer, Ahmad & Onn, 
2009; Grismer, Wood & Grismer, 2009). In the recent 
description of Sphenomorphus temengorensis, 
Grismer, Ahmad & Onn (2009) summarized the eight 
species of diminutive skinks in Peninsular Malaysia, 
all of which are morphologically and ecologically 
similar to the species in Clade A. We also expect that 
diminutive species in Indonesia: Sphenomorphus temmincki, 
Sphenomorphus schlegeli, Sphenomorphus 
sanana, Sphenomorphus textus, Sphenomorphus 
necopinatus, and Sphenomorphus vanheurni to be 
part of this clade based on morphological similarity. 
Expanded taxon sampling to include these other 
diminutive species will hopefully resolve their

relationships to Clade A, or elucidate part of another 
convergent lineage. 
The genera Lipinia, Scincella, and Papuascincus 
are all nested within a clade of Sphenomorphus 
species from Indochina, Borneo, and the Philippines 
(Clades B, C, D, E). The Central American Sphenomorphus 
species Sphenomorphus cherriei and Sphenomorphus 
assatus are nested within Scincella and 
closely related to Scincella lateralis. Lipinia is monophyletic 
and sister to Papuascincus. There is low 
support for the monophyly of Lipinia (posterior probability 
= 0.83), but we note that we only included 
Lipinia noctua and Lipinia pulchella. More sampling 
may increase support for this genus. Pustulated 
structures on the surface of the eggshells in three 
species of Lobulia skinks led Allison & Greer (1986) 
to describe Papuascincus. These structures are 
unique amongst skinks and may represent a reliable 
synapomorphy for this clade. Additionally, Greer 
(1974) hypothesized that Lipinia, Lobulia, and Prasinohaema 
were related. Given the hypothesis of 
Greer (1974) and that Papuascincus was previously 
included in Lobulia, we expect that Lobulia and Prasinohaema 
will be related to Clade D of Lipinia and 
Papuascincus. 
Clade B consists of one Philippine species, 
Sphenomorphus variegatus, which is closely related 
to a clade of the Bornean species Sphenomorphus 
multisquamatus, Sphenomorphus sabanus, and 
Sphenomorphus cyanolaemus. Both Sphenomorphus 
multisquamatus and Sphenomorphus sabanus were 
considered Sphenomorphus variegatus until Inger 
(1958) distinguished them. The species in Clade B are 
part of Greer & Parker’s (1967) Sphenomorphus variegatus 
group, which was defined based on external 
morphology. These skinks are considered surface 
dwellers and Greer & Parker (1967) included a 
diverse array of species in the group. The Sphenomorphus 
variegatus group is not monophyletic in our 
phylogeny, with representatives in Clade B, E, G, and 
K. We speculate that with increased sampling, we will 
find that most of the species in the Sphenomorphus 
variegatus group belong to Clade B. However, given 
the placement of some species in the Sphenomorphus 
variegatus group in other clades, it would be premature 
to assign unsampled species to clades identified 
here on the basis of overall morphological gestalt. 
We do not have a sample of Sphenomorphus melanopogon, 
the type species of the genus Sphenomorphus. 
There are few samples of this species in 
museums and the type series contains multiple 
species, raising the question of the true identity of 
Sphenomorphus melanopogon (C. W. Linkem, pers. 
observ.). The type series for Sphenomorphus melanopogon 
contains species that are morphologically 
similar to species in Clades B and F. There is one 
sample of Sphenomorphus melanopogon sequenced 
and available through GenBank from the work of 
Schmitz (2003), which is related to species in Clade F 
(not shown). A revision of Sphenomorphus melanopogon 
is in progress (G. Shea, pers. comm.), which will 
resolve the placement of the type species of Sphenomorphus. 
Until then, it is unclear whether Sphenomorphus 
sensu stricto is our Clade B or Clade F. 
Papua New Guinea and the islands of the West 
Pacific are the most diverse regions for Sphenomorphus. 
Our sampling from these regions is limited in 
this phylogeny, but all species sampled are closely 
related in Clade F. Thus, we suspect that most of the 
Papuan and West Pacific diversity of Sphenomorphus 
will be related to Clade F. Greer & Parker (1967) 
divided Papuan Sphenomorphus into the Sphenomorphus 
variegatus and the Sphenomorphus fasciatus 
groups. Part of the Sphenomorphus fasciatus group 
was later put in the Sphenomorphus maindroni group 
based on a synapomorphic scale character (Greer & 
Shea, 2003). We have shown that the Sphenomorphus 
variegatus group is nonmonophyletic, and the 
one species (Sphenomorphus concinnatus) from the 
Papuan region that we sampled appears in Clade F. 
However, other species in the Sphenomorphus variegatus 
group fall into different clades. Members of the 
Sphenomorphus maindroni group (Sphenomorphus 
cranei, Sphenomorphus fasciatus, Sphenomorphus 
solomonis, and Sphenomorphus scutatus) form a clade 
based on the four species sampled (of the 22 species in 
the group). Our results suggest that the Sphenomorphus 
maindroni group may be a monophyletic assemblage, 
whereas the Sphenomorphus variegatus group 
should be revised. 
The Sphenomorphus group is most diverse in Australia, 
where it is represented by 15 genera (Reeder, 
2003; Skinner, 2007). In these studies of the Australian 
genera, outgroup sampling for the Sphenomorphus 
group included only limited sampling of 
Papuan Sphenomorphus species. We have found that 
the Australian group forms a polytomy with Philippine 
species in Clade I + Sphenomorphus cumingi, 
and is not closely related to Papuan species. The 
Australia + Philippines polytomy has a posterior 
probability of 1.0, rejecting all possibilities for alternative 
Australian clade relationships given our 
current sampling and analyses. We cannot reject the 
hypothesis that the Australia group is sister to clade 
I + Sphenomorphus cumingi, as these groups collapse 
to a polytomy (Table 7). Increased gene sampling from 
the Australian clade and inclusion of more taxa from 
Papua and Indonesia may help to resolve this set of 
relationships. 
Most of the Philippine species are found in Clade I, 
which can be subdivided into Clades H and J. If 
Sphenomorphus mindanensis is removed from Clade 
1230 C. W. LINKEM ET AL.

H, the lineage is the same as Brown & Alcala’s 
(1980) Group 5 and the same group examined 
in Linkem et al. (2010b). The relationships amongst 
the Sphenomorphus abdictus–Sphenomorphus coxi– 
Sphenomorphus jagori group are similar to those 
found in Linkem et al. (2010b), but one of the clades 
identified in that study (Sphenomorphus abdictus 
aquilonius 8) is not monophyletic with the increased 
gene sampling in this study. Sphenomorphus abdictus 
aquilonius 8 is a large clade with a disjunct geographical 
distribution in the south-west of Luzon and 
the islands north of Luzon. Finding that the populations 
in these geographical regions differ with the 
analysis of more data is not surprising, showing 
that even the division of widespread taxa in Linkem 
et al. (2010b) may still be insufficient to explain 
the diversity in the Sphenomorphus abdictus– 
Sphenomorphus coxi–Sphenomorphus jagori group. 
Sphenomorphus mindanensis was not included in the 
Linkem et al. (2010b) analysis of Group 5. It is interesting 
that we uncovered Sphenomorphus mindanensis 
as sister to Group 5 because it has nearly identical 
coloration to Sphenomorphus coxi coxi, but is smaller. 
Sphenomorphus mindanensis is part of Brown & 
Alcala’s (1980) Group 3, and based on our morphological 
analyses of scale counts does not resemble 
members of the morphologically cohesive Group 5. 
The placement of Sphenomorphus acutus and Sphenomorphus 
diwata is tenuous. Clade J, supporting 
these species as sister to Clade K, has low support 
(posterior probability = 0.77). Morphologically, it is 
also difficult to ascertain where these species might fit 
best within the Philippine taxa. Sphenomorphus 
acutus is morphologically unique, with a body shape 
most similar to Emoia, a distantly related genus. It 
does not resemble Sphenomorphus diwata, or any of 
the other species in the Philippines. Based on its 
unique appearance, we expected that it would be 
related to species outside the Philippines, but clearly 
our assumptions were incorrect. Sphenomorphus 
diwata has been considered part of Group 1, and 
morphologically similar to the Luzon high-elevation 
species Sphenomorphus beyeri, Sphenomorphus 
boyingi, Sphenomorphus hadros, and Sphenomorphus 
igorotorum; however, Sphenomorphus diwata clearly 
is not related to these taxa. Increased gene sampling 
will probably help to resolve the relationship of these 
two Mindanao species with respect to the rest of 
Clade I in the Philippines. 
We sampled multiple populations for two widespread 
species that we suspected contained cryptic 
genetic lineages. Sphenomorphus steerei is abundant 
on all the major Philippine islands except Palawan, 
where it is absent, and our analyses infer two highly 
divergent clades on Luzon, four divergent clades on 
Mindanao, and four clades on the Visayan PAIC. In 
some cases, these divergent clades occur in sympatry 
(Sphenomorphus cf. steerei sp. 5 & 6 on Panay; Sphenomorphus 
cf. steerei sp. 4 & 5 on Negros; Sphenomorphus 
cf. steerei sp. 1 & 7 on Mt. Banahao on Luzon), 
thereby suggesting that these may be exclusive lineages 
in need of species recognition. As Sphenomorphus 
steerei is a diminutive skink it is difficult to find 
externally diagnosable characters for these separate 
lineages. Populations of Sphenomorphus decipiens 
also show significant levels of genetic divergence; 
unlike Sphenomorphus steerei, there are pronounced 
morphological differences amongst clades. The most 
divergent population (Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens 
sp. 4) occurs at high elevations on Mt. Banahao and 
Mt. Palali on Luzon Island. Genetically, this population 
is most similar to the other high-elevation 
species – Sphenomorphus beyeri, Sphenomorphus 
boyingi, Sphenomorphus hadros, Sphenomorphus igorotorum, 
and Sphenomorphus laterimaculatus. Scale 
counts and the size of Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens 
sp. 4 diagnose it as Sphenomorphus decipiens; 
however, these resemblances clearly are convergences 
because these populations of skinks are genetically so 
distinct from other Sphenomorphus decipiens. Sphenomorphus 
decipiens and Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens 
species 1, 2, and 3 form a clade, but there are 
morphological differences amongst these subclades. 
Additionally, Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens sp. 1, 2, 
and 4 all occur on Mt. Banahao on Luzon, with 
Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens sp. 1 and 2 occurring in 
sympatry and Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens sp. 4 
occurring at a higher elevation on the mountain. 
We were surprised to find that the diminutive, 
high-elevation Parvoscincus sisoni on Panay Island 
is sister to the small, high-elevation Sphenomorphus 
tagapayo on Luzon Island. These miniaturized

species seem to have limited ranges on the mountains 
on which they occur; thus, it is difficult to ascertain 
relationships between these distant populations, 
especially given the suspected low probability of 
detection in intervening forested regions. 
TAXONOMIC REVISION 
Our analyses reveal that Sphenomorphus is not 
monophyletic, and that a large portion of its diversity 
is more closely related to a variety of other skink 
genera. Paraphyly has been shown in other studies of 
lygosomine skinks (Honda et al., 2003), but far less 
severe than that characterizing our results. Although 
most of our sampling was from species in the genus 
Sphenomorphus, and primarily from the Philippines, 
every other genus of the Sphenomorphus group 
included in this study renders Sphenomorphus 
paraphyletic. 
Given the apparent wholesale paraphyly characterizing 
the Sphenomorphus group, we will avoid some 
taxonomic changes until future analyses incorporate 
more taxon sampling (C. W. Linkem, unpubl. data). 
However we agree with Graybeal & Cannatella (1995) 
that phylogenetic definitions of taxon names are often 
best viewed as works in progress, allowing for some 
well-substantiated changes to be made as evidence 
justifying such changes becomes available. To that 
end, we have implemented a few taxonomic changes 
that are clearly warranted on the basis of our current 
results. These changes are an initial step toward a 
generic revision for the Sphenomorphus group and 
primarily affect the species from the Philippines, 
where our sampling is robust (Fig. 4). 
Our fully partitioned Bayesian tree presents six 
separate invasions of the Philippines, each of which is 
a monophyletic, historical unit. Future taxonomic 
work will benefit from the recognition of these units 
as independent from Sphenomorphus sensu stricto. 
Previously defined names are available for most of the 
lineages defined herein. Insulasaurus and Otosaurus 
are revalidated and Scincella and Parvoscincus are 
expanded to include clades defined here. We define 
two new genera based on phylogenetic results and 
apply stem-based names to these groups. 
NEW GENERA 
Tytthoscincus gen. nov. 
Type species: Tytthoscincus hallieri (Lidth de Jeude, 
1905). 
Definition: The clade comprising Tytthoscincus hallieri 
(Lidth de Juede, 1905) and all species that share 
a more recent common ancestor with Tytthoscincus 
hallieri than with Anomalopus verreauxii, Calyptotis 
scutirostrum, Coeranoscincus frontalis, Coggeria 
naufragus, Ctenotus taeniolatus, Eremiascincus richardsonii, 
Eulamprus quoyiii, Glaphyromorphus 
isolepis, Gnypetoscincus queenslandiae, Hemiergis 
decresiensis, Insulasaurus wrighti, Lerista lineata, 
Lipinia pulchella, Nangura spinosa, Notoscincus 
ornatus, Ophioscincus australis, Otosaurus cumingi, 
Papuascincus stanleyanus, Parvoscincus sisoni, 
Pinoyscincus jagori, Prasinohaema flavipes, Saiphos 
equalis, Scincella lateralis, and Sphenomorphus 
melanopogon. 
Etymology: From the Greek tytthos, meaning ‘small’ 
and the Latin scincus for lizard; the combination 
refers to the small sizes of the species in this genus. 
Suggested common name: diminutive Asian skink. 
Description: Tytthoscincus can be identified by the 
following characters: (1) body size diminutive, usually 
less than 45 mm SVL; (2) temporal scales small, same 
size and shape as lateral body scales (Fig. 5); and (3) 
digits small, toe IV slightly longer than, or equal to, 
toe III. 
Included species: Tytthoscincus aesculeticolus (Inger 
et al., 2001), Tytthoscincus atrigularis (Stejneger, 
1905), Tytthoscincus biparietalis (Taylor, 1918), 
Tytthoscincus hallieri (Lidth de Juede, 1905), and 
Tytthoscincus parvus (Boulenger, 1897). 
Comment: This clade of diminutive species has unique 
features that diagnoses it from all other skinks of the 
Sphenomorphus group. Although we lack genetic 
data for Tytthoscincus biparentialis, we nonetheless 
include it in this genus because it shares the unique 
presence of divided parietal scales with Tytthoscincus 
hallieri. The diminutive skinks of Malaysia 
(Grismer, Ahmad & Onn, 2009) should probably also 
be placed in this new genus, although we prefer to 
leave that decision in abeyance until a morphological 
and genetic examination of those taxa are complete. 
Tytthoscincus parvus (Boulenger, 1897) is one of three 
species of diminutive skinks described from Sulawesi 
Island. It is likely that the other diminutive species 
on Sulawesi, Sphenomorphus temmincki and Sphenomorphus 
textus are also part of Tytthoscincus. 
Future examination of temporal scales on small 
skinks in South-East Asia should reveal the species 
composition of Tytthoscincus. 
Pinoyscincus gen. nov.

Description: Pinoyscincus can be identified by the 
following combination of characters: (1) body size 
medium to large (> 42 mm SVL); (2) paravertebral 
scale rows 56–80; (3) midbody scale rows 30–44; and 
(4) subdigital lamellae 17–26. In addition to these 
scale characters, species in this genus share a unique 
morphology of the hemipenis. The main shaft of the 
hemipenis, before the bifurcation, is wide with a large 
bulbous lobe on each lateral side of the shaft (Fig. 6). 
Included species: Pinoyscincus abdictus (Brown & 
Alcala, 1980), Pinoyscincus coxi (Taylor, 1915), Pinoyscincus 
jagori (Peters, 1864), Pinoyscincus llanosi 
(Taylor, 1919), and Pinoyscincus mindanensis (Taylor, 
1922). 
Comment: This morphologically cohesive genus 
includes Brown & Alcala’s (1980) Group 5 and Pinoyscincus 
mindanensis. All of these species are easily 
diagnosable among the Philippine skink fauna. The 
morphology of the hemipenis in this genus has been 
observed in Pinoyscincus mindanensis, Pinoyscincus 
abdictus, Pinoyscincus jagori, and Pinoyscincus 
llanosi and has not been observed in any other Philippine 
skink examined (Otosaurus cumingi, Insulasaurus 
arborens, Insulasaurus traanorum, 
Parvoscincus beyeri, Parvoscincus decipiens, Sphenomorphus 
fasciatus, Sphenomorphus variegatus). 
We have not examined the hemipenis of Sphenomorphus 
acutus or Sphenomorphus diwata yet to see if 
they share the Pinoyscincus character so we prefer to 
leave them incertae sedis until a more thorough 
examination can be performed.

Sphenomorphus melanopogon, and Tytthoscincus 
hallieri. 
Description: Insulasaurus is diagnosed by the following 
combination of characters: (1) medium body size, 
45–64 mm SVL; (2) paravertebral scale rows 62–78; 
(3) midbody scale rows 29–41; and (4) subdigital 
lamellae 15–25. 
Included species: Insulasaurus arborens (Taylor, 
1917), Insulasaurus traanorum (Linkem, Diesmos & 
Brown, 2010a), Insulasaurus wrighti Taylor, 1925, 
and Insulasaurus victoria (Brown & Alcala, 1980). 
Comment: The monotypic genus Insulasaurus was 
described by Taylor (1925) based on the presence of 
a divided frontonasal scale. Greer & Parker (1967) 
found this character to be variable within Insulasaurus 
wrighti, and subsequently placed Insulasaurus 
wrighti in the Sphenomorphus variegatus group 
and synonymized Insulasaurus with Sphenomorphus. 
We found that Insulasaurus wrighti, Insulasaurus 
victoria, Insulasaurus traanorum (all from 
Palawan Island), and Insulasaurus arborens (Panay 
Island) are monophyletic, and distinct from other 
Philippine skinks. Our phylogeny suggests that 
this small, unique, and biogeographically circumscribed 
clade is more closely related to the genera 
Lipinia and Papuascincus, but separate from both, 
and therefore worthy of designation as a unique 
genus. 
At this time, we have no data suggesting that other 
Sphenomorphus species would be properly placed in 
the genus Insulasaurus, although species in Borneo 
(e.g. Sphenomorphus kinabaluensis and Sphenomorphus 
murudensis) are potential candidates should 
future phylogenetic studies determine that they are 
more closely related to Insulasaurus than they are to 
Sphenomorphus s.s.

Otosaurus Gray, 1845 
Type species: Otosaurus cumingi Gray, 1845. 
Definition: The clade comprising Otosaurus cumingi 
(Gray, 1845) and all species that share a more recent 
common ancestor with Otosaurus cumingi than 
with Anomalopus verreauxii, Calyptotis scutirostrum, 
Coeranoscincus frontalis, Coggeria naufragus,

stanleyanus, Parvoscincus sisoni, Pinoyscincus 
jagori, Prasinohaema flavipes, Saiphos equalis, Scincella 
lateralis, Sphenomorphus melanopogon, and Tytthoscincus 
hallieri. 
Description: Otosaurus is diagnosed by the following 
combination of characters: (1) body large and robust, 
with adults being longer than 115 mm SVL; (2) large 
supranasal scales in contact medially, occluding frontonasal 
contact with the rostral; and (3) supraoculars 
seven or eight. 
Included species: Otosaurus cumingi Gray, 1845. 
Comments: The species Otosaurus cumingi Gray, 
1845 has always been a morphological outlier to the 
other Philippine skinks. Being the only Sphenomorphus 
group skink in the region to have large supranasal 
scales and having an average body size double 
that of other species (Gray, 1845; Taylor, 1922a, 
Brown & Alcala, 1980), it has been recognized as 
phenotypically distinct and unique amongst Philippine 
skinks. Our genetic and morphological results 
confirm its uniqueness amongst other lineages. Historically, 
this species was placed in the genus Otosaurus 
Gray, 1845 because of its distinctive morphology. 
As Otosaurus cumingi is the type species for the 
genus Otosaurus and is found to be both morphologically 
and genetically distinct, and our phylogenetic 
analyses place it in a polytomy with the Australian 
genera of the Sphenomorphus group and with the 
clade of Parvoscincus and Pinoyscincus, we 
re-establish Otosaurus as a monotypic genus, moving 
cumingi from Sphenomorphus to Otosaurus. 
GENERIC REVISION 
Parvoscincus Ferner, Brown & Greer, 1997 
Type species: Parvoscincus sisoni Ferner, Brown & 
Greer, 1997. 
Definition: The clade comprising Parvoscincus sisoni 
(Ferner, Brown & Greer, 1997) and all species that 
share a more recent common ancestor with Parvoscincus 
sisoni than with Anomalopus verreauxii, Calyptotis 
scutirostrum, Coeranoscincus frontalis, Coggeria 
naufragus, Ctenotus taeniolatus, Eremiascincus richardsonii, 
Eulamprus quoyii, Glaphyromorphus

cumingii, Papuascincus stanleyanus, Pinoyscincus 
jagori, Prasinohaema flavipes, Saiphos equalis, 
Scincella lateralis, Sphenomorphus melanopogon, and 
Tytthoscincus hallieri. 
Description: Parvoscincus is diagnosed by the following 
combination of characters: (1) body size usually 
small (< 55 mm SVL) but larger in high-elevation 
species (46 mm < SVL < 86 mm); (2) four enlarged 
supraoculars; (3) paravertebral scales 51–110; (4) 
midbody scale rows 23–46; and (5) subdigital lamellae 
10–20. 
Included species: Parvoscincus beyeri (Taylor, 1922), 
Parvoscincus boyingi (Brown et al., 2010), Parvoscincus 
decipiens (Boulenger, 1894), Parvoscincus hadros 
(Brown et al., 2010), Parvoscincus igorotorum (Brown 
et al., 2010), Parvoscincus laterimaculatus (Brown & 
Alcala, 1980), Parvoscincus leucospilos (Peters, 
1872), Parvoscincus lawtoni (Brown & Alcala, 1980), 
Parvoscincus luzonensis (Boulenger, 1894), Parvoscincus 
kitangladensis (Brown, 1995), Parvoscincus palawanensis 
(Brown & Alcala, 1961), Parvoscincus sisoni 
(Ferner, Brown & Greer, 1997), Parvoscincus steerei 
(Stejneger, 1908), and Parvoscincus tagapayo (Brown 
et al., 1999). 
Comments: The recently described genus Parvoscincus 
(Ferner, Brown & Greer, 1997) is nested within a 
large clade of Philippine Sphenomorphus (Clade K). 
Represented in our phylogeny by the type species, 
Parvoscincus sisoni, it is clear that this genus is not 
phylogenetically distinct from other Philippine Sphenomorphus 
as originally proposed (Ferner, Brown & 
Greer, 1997). The other species in this genus, Parvoscincus 
palawanensis, was not sampled; therefore, 
it is uncertain if it would be related to Parvoscincus 
sisoni, but we assume that it is until contrary evidence 
is presented. Clade K is clearly a unique and 
supported group of mostly small species of Philippine 
Sphenomorphus. As Parvoscincus is placed within 
this clade, we recommend that the name Parvoscincus 
be expanded to include the other small-bodied species 
in this Philippine clade (Parvoscincus leucospilos, 
Parvoscincus tagapayao, Parvoscincus luzonensis,

Parvoscincus laterimaculatus, Parvoscincus steerei, 
Parvoscincus decipiens) in addition to the secondarily 
enlarged, montane forest species (Parvoscincus beyeri, 
Parvoscincus boyingi, Parvoscincus igorotorum, and 
Parvoscincus hadros). Two species (Sphenomorphus 
acutus and Sphenomorphus diwata) in the Philippines 
are not diagnosable to either Parvoscincus or 
Pinoyscincus. These morphologically distinct species 
are genetically most similar to Parvoscincus, but this 
relationship has low phylogenetic support. We prefer 
to leave these species incertae sedis until a more 
thorough examination can be performed.

(SVL usually < 65 mm); (2) alpha palate (Greer, 1974) 
with nine premaxillary teeth; (3) long, thin postorbital 
bone usually present; and (4) with a transparent 
window in a movable lower eyelid. Transparent

tsinglingensis (Hu & Djao, 1966), Scincella vandenburghi 
(Schmidt, 1927), and Scincella victoriana 
(Shreve, 1940). 
Comment: The New World species Scincella cherriei 
and Scincella assata are nested within the genus 
Scincella, sister to the North American species Scincella 
lateralis. We predict that Scincella rarus, and 
Scincella incertus also will be members of this clade. 
When Greer (1974: 33) revised the genus Leiolepisma, 
he provided detailed comments about the potential 
relationships of these Central American skinks. Morphologically, 
these species are a mix of Sphenomorphus 
and Scincella, with Scincella assatus and 
Scincella incertus lacking a postorbital bone but possessing 
a window in the lower eye (characters of 
Scincella) and Scincella cherriei possessing a postorbital 
bone but having population variation in the 
presence of the lower eyelid window. Greer (1974) 
inferred that Scincella cherriei was the primitive form 
of the Central American radiation owing to the possession 
of the postorbital bone and placed these 
species in Sphenomorphus. He noted that this did not 
make sense biogeographically because it inferred a 
separate migration across the Bering Bridge, but he 
argued it was more plausible than the re-evolution of 
the postorbital bone in Scincella cherriei. Our molecular 
evidence shows that the Central American species 
are part of the same radiation as North American 
Scincella, following the biogeographical expectation. 
It is therefore reasonable to move these Central 
American skinks to the genus Scincella. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This study, along with several other recent works, 
demonstrates the need for thorough systematic revision 
of Scincidae, the largest monophyletic family of 
squamates. We have shown that the largest genus of 
skinks in Scincidae is highly paraphyletic. Based on 
our phylogeny, morphological convergence in scale 
characters and body size are common within Philippine 
Sphenomorphus; these phenomena clearly have 
confounded past supraspecific taxonomic treatments. 
Taxonomic revisions based on robust molecular phylogenies 
may avoid misdiagnosing phylogenetic relationships 
resulting from high levels of homoplasy in

some morphological characters. However, it is clear 
that many of these same morphological characters are 
useful for identifying new species. We have shown 
that species composition varies on different islands, 
with Luzon and Palawan being composed of closely 
related species, and the Mindanao faunal region 
being composed of an assembled fauna, derived from 
multiple separate invasions of the archipelago. Widespread 
species in the Philippines continue to show 
divergent relationships both within and between 
islands, and divergent clades often occur in sympatry. 
It is likely that morphological examination of subclades 
of these widespread species may reveal greater 
species diversity than currently recognized. If so, a 
more comprehensive understanding of Philippine 
Sphenomorphus group skinks will require a deeper 
knowledge of the diversity of the skinks in this 
unique archipelago.
