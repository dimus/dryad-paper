Abstract
Southern South America provides a set of unusual geographic features that make it particularly interesting for studying phylogeography. The Andes Mountains run along a north-to-south axis and act as a barrier to gene flow for much of the biota of this region, with southern portions experiencing extensive historical glaciation. Geological data reveal a series of drainage reversals, shifting from Pacific Ocean outlets to Atlantic Ocean outlets because of glacier formation that dammed and reversed rivers. Once glaciers melted around 13 000 years ago, drainages returned to the Pacific Ocean. This geologic history predicts that aquatic organisms in Pacific rivers should have their closest relationships to their counterparts in Atlantic rivers immediately to their east. We tested this prediction in the trichomycterid catfish Hatcheria macraei from 38 locations using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Our results show that most populations found in Pacific rivers were closely related to fish found in the adjacent Atlantic draining Rı ́o Chubut. Surprisingly, one documented drainage reversal (from Rı ́o Deseado into Rı ́o Baker) did not result in movement of H. macraei. Overall, we found the lowest levels of genetic structure between most Pacific rivers that are adjacent to the Atlantic draining Rı ́o Chubut. We also found low levels of population structuring among three of four contemporary river basins that drain to the Atlantic Ocean. Our findings suggest that drainage basin boundaries have historically not played an important long-term role in structuring between nine of 11 drainages, an unusual finding in freshwater biogeography.

Introduction
Geographic bias remains an issue in phylogeographic research, with most published work focused on northern hemisphere taxa (i.e. North America and Europe) (Bernatchez & Wilson 1998; Avise 2000; Beheregaray

2008). Hence, it remains unclear whether
derived from this growing body of research can be globally applied. Clearly, different parts of the world have experienced different historical events that determine how genetic diversity is partitioned across landscapes. For instance, Pleistocene glaciation in the northern hemisphere has been extensive with large areas of the total land mass covered by glacial ice. In contrast, glaciation in the southern hemisphere has been

 comparatively small (Ehlers & Gibbard 2007). Moreover, the shape, topography and latitudinal extent of total land mass also differ between the northern and southern hemispheres: the northern hemisphere has almost continuous land spanning the globe at latitudes north of 45° N; in contrast, latitudes south of 45° S are almost completely devoid of land. Hence, such differences between the northern and southern parts of the globe could have important effects on the distribution and genetic structuring of species that occupy these areas. However, to test this idea requires more effort to understand general phylogeographic trends in the southern hemisphere (Beheregaray 2008).
Southern South America provides a different geography than most historically glaciated regions of the world, making it particularly interesting for studying genetic variation in aquatic species (e.g. Aegla crabs, Perez-Losada et al. 2004; Xu et al. 2009; freshwater
fishes, Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010). This is largely because of the Andes mountain range, which has a north-to-south axis along the entire western edge of South America, potentially isolating eastern and western biota. For most of its extent, the Andes form the drainage divide between Pacific and Atlantic drainages. However, major rivers draining to the Pacific Ocean in the Southern Andes (south of R ́ıo Maull ́ın to R ́ıo Baker; Fig. 1) are unique in that the highest mountains in this area do not demark the east– west drainage divide. Instead, the headwaters of these rivers occur to the east of the Andes Mountains, and these rivers actually drain westward through deep canyons that penetrate the mountains. These rivers have probably had ancient connections to the Pacific Ocean that pre-date the rise of the southern Andes (Bourgois et al. 2000; Coronato et al. 2008). This drainage pattern has interesting implications for the aquatic

biogeography of the region today. Current geological hypotheses suggest that glaciers covered most of southern Chile and extended as a single continuous unit north along the Andes to around 38° S (Fig. 1) (Hulton et al. 2002). These glaciers blocked river flow to the west and created large lakes along the eastern edge of glaciers (Hein et al. 2010) that eventually filled and overtopped drainage divides, reversing drainage flow to the Atlantic Ocean. As glaciers melted, ice dams were breached and drainages returned to the Pacific Ocean (Hein et al. 2010). The best-documented example of this is the R ́ıo Baker (Fig. 1), which was diverted to the Atlantic Ocean during the Late Pleistocene and returned to the Pacific Ocean around 12.8 ka (Turner et al. 2005; Bell 2008; Hein et al. 2010). Detailed studies on Pacific rivers northofR ́ıoBakerarelackingwithrespecttopaleolake formation and river reversals, but it appears likely in these systems that substantial glacial meltwater also flowed to the Atlantic, either directly from glaciers or via pro-glacial lakes (Mart ́ınez & Kutschker 2011). Interestingly, geological data indicate that the R ́ıo Negro was an exception to this west to east reversal; instead, this Atlantic draining river was blocked by moraines which diverted its flow into the R ́ıo Puelo, a Pacific drainage at 13.2 ka for approximately 2000 years before draining back to the Atlantic (Tatur et al. 2002). Hence, geological data suggest that aquatic taxa in southern South America have had several opportunities for genetic exchange through the Andes mountain range.
Considerable biogeographic evidence also exists that supports a close relationship between populations of species that occupy Pacific and Atlantic basins in glaciated regions of Patagonia. South of the R ́ıo Maull ́ın, all Pacific rivers have closer fish faunal relationships to Atlantic basins than from Pacific basins from the R ́ıo Maull ́ın north (Ringuelet 1975; Pascual et al. 2007; Aigo et al. 2008). Moreover, genetic data for three freshwater fishes from the region (Galaxias platei, Galaxias maculatus and Percichthys trucha) show a close relationship between Pacific and Atlantic basins (Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010). Hence, all recent research on fishes from this region suggests that glacialinduced reversals of river drainages have been a key factor responsible for the similarities between the Pacific and Atlantic fauna and their genetic relationships (Cussac et al. 2004; Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010). Unfortunately, we still have relatively few studies evaluating this hypothesis, and even fewer that examine patterns of historical gene flow in the context of known glacial events.
Here, we use the trichomycterid catfish Hatcheria macraei to explore the effects of Atlantic-Pacific drainage reversals across the southern Andes Mountains. We also examine patterns of genetic structuring along a
north-south axis using populations found in both Atlantic and Pacific slope drainages. Based on geological (Tatur et al. 2002; Turner et al. 2005) and biological research (Cussac et al. 2004; Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010), we expect that populations occupying fully glaciated Pacific draining rivers should have their closest relatives in Atlantic draining rivers immediately to their east rather than Atlantic rivers to their north-east or south-east (Fig. 1). Thus, the closest pairs of adjacent Pacific-Atlantic rivers are R ́ıo Baker and R ́ıo Deseado; R ́ıo Ayse ́n, Palena, Yelcho and Puelo with R ́ıo Chubut; but also with influence from R ́ıo Negro into R ́ıo Puelo. We also examine relationships between the four Atlantic rivers to ascertain the degree of isolation existing between these currently isolated drainages as they occur in areas less directly affected by glacial ice and paleolake drainage reversals. We expect that populations occupying Atlantic draining rivers should show genetic structuring consistent with historical isolation from one another, and that these populations should be more structured from one another than populations that shared recent PacificAtlantic drainage connections. Lastly, we expect that northern Pacific basin populations should be somewhat distinctive because of their more isolated geographic location, while populations from southern fully glaciated Pacific drainages should all be quite similar as they were probably recolonized from similar sources. Our research builds upon previously published work (e.g. Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010) in two important ways. First, we sampled broadly across the range of H. macraei, which includes many Pacific and Atlantic drainages known to be historically connected because of glacial activity. We specifically sampled areas where drainage reversals were thought to have occurred, thus creating the most geographically comprehensive data set for explicitly testing hypotheses about fish movement between these rivers. Second, the biology of H. macraei differs from that of other species previously examined; this is a benthic species that is widespread in both headwater and lowland habitats, allowing it to take advantage of different opportunities to move between river basins in the past. Hence, our work is an important addition to the growing body of work that examines biogeographic patterns of freshwater organisms in the Patagonia region of southern South America.
Materials and methods
Geological history and hypothesis justification
In this study, we evaluate two sets of hypotheses relative to east-west and north-south relationships. These
Ó 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

hypotheses are based on geological data and previously published phylogeographic research. Here, we describe in detail the geological history that underpins our predictions. Southern South America has experienced periods of glaciation since at least late Miocene, with the largest glacial extent recorded 1.2 million years ago (Hein et al. 2011). The largest glacial event covered three times more area than the most recent glaciation during the late Pleistocene, with much of the extra ice present in the southernmost regions of the continent (Mercer 1976; Clapperton 1990; Singer et al. 2004). Since late Miocene, glacial events have recurred at roughly 100 000–150 000 years timescales. Hence, the region has been repeatedly glaciated. However, the extent of ice has gradually decreased over the last million years (Singer et al. 2004). At the peak of the last glaciation, it is thought that a single glacial ice sheet extended from the Andes Mountains to the Pacific Ocean from near Chiloe ́ Island and to the south (Fig. 1; Hulton et al. 2002; Singer et al. 2004). This glacial sheet should have eliminated the entire aquatic fauna from Pacific drainages south of R ́ıo Maull ́ın (Fig. 1). In theory, some fauna may have persisted in unglaciated headwater regions; however, during full glaciation, the limited portion of the headwaters would have been extremely cold with some of it changed from a riverine to a lacustrine environment (Turner et al. 2005). Moreover, these headwater regions may have been isolated for a period of time before sufficient water accumulated to divert flow across the drainage divide towards the Atlantic Ocean. Any aquatic fauna that survived these changes would now have had a direct connection to Atlantic drainages. In addition, fauna from Atlantic rivers could potentially invade these new headwater reaches once rivers overflowed towards the Atlantic Ocean. Then, when glaciers melted and rivers returned to the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic fauna could have dispersed downstream to recolonize these systems. Hence, this glacial history could have promoted the movement of aquatic organisms across the Andes in both directions if any of the pre-existing Pacific fauna was able to survive from the onset of glaciation to the establishment of exclusive Atlantic drainage. This pattern of river reversion was probably repeated during each glacial cycle (every 100– 150 000 years for at least the last million years or more), although the eastern extent of ice would have differed during each glaciation event (Singer et al. 2004).
While glaciation is thought to have had major impacts on east-west biotic exchange, it is less likely to have influenced north-south exchanges of freshwater species in most Atlantic and Pacific drainages. Patterns between Pacific basins are potentially complex. Northern drainages should show evidence for lower gene flow because of their geographic isolation in areas less
affected by glaciation. However, one specific headwater region may have been influenced by glacial-induced drainage reversal (Lago La ́car a headwater tributary of the Valdivia basin that begins east of the Andes Mountains adjacent to the Negro basin, Fig. 1). Southern Pacific basins that were fully glaciated should be genetically similar to each other because most were probably recolonized from the same source (i.e. R ́ıo Chubut). Atlantic drainages are all isolated by drainage divides distant from extensive glaciation (Fig. 1). Drainage divides are considered to be a fundamentally important barrier that limits the potential for freshwater species to move between basins (Banarescu 1990; Matthews 1998; Rahel 2007). As a result, patterns of genetic diversity are frequently structured based upon drainage divides (see review by Hughes 2007). Genetic exchange across current drainage divides is thought to be facilitated by drainage rearrangements (e.g. river capture) and by movement across shallow drainage divides that provide temporary dispersal routes (Banarescu 1990; Unmack 2001; Thacker et al. 2007). Adjacent coastal rivers also have the potential for their fauna to mix via lowland connections across the continental shelf during periods of lower sea levels (e.g. Ruzzante et al. 2011). Unexpectedly, previous work found quite low levels of genetic structure in Percichthys fishes examined from adjacent Atlantic basins (Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011). In contrast, the trichomycterid catfish Trichomycterus areolatus from unglaciated Pacific basins had high genetic structure (Unmack et al. 2009b). Given this background, we make two general predictions: (i) we expect evidence of higher recent gene flow from each Atlantic basin into the adjacent Pacific drainage relative to nonadjacent Atlantic-Pacific basins; and (ii) evidence for lower rates of north-south gene flow among both Atlantic and nonglaciated Pacific river basins than between Atlantic and adjacent Pacific drainages.
Study taxa and sampling
Hatcheria macraei provides an excellent model to test these hypotheses because of its widespread distribution among multiple adjacent Pacific and Atlantic rivers in Patagonia. It occurs in Pacific rivers from the R ́ıo Imperial south to R ́ıo Baker, and in Atlantic drainages, it ranges from the far northern R ́ıo Colorado south to the R ́ıo Deseado (Fig. 1, Liotta 2006; Unmack et al. 2009a). In Argentina, we find that H. macraei is typically widespread and often abundant where it occurs, especially in Atlantic drainages. Despite extensive sampling within Chile using sampling techniques known to capture H. macraei, we found this species to be less widespread within river basins and less common, with five recent records from northern river basins that were par-

tially glaciated, and five records from the glaciated region, one each from the R ́ıo Puelo and R ́ıo Ayse ́n and several sites in R ́ıo Baker (Fig. 1; Unmack et al. 2009a). Many Chilean rivers in this region have a significantly higher gradient than in Argentina. Given that H. macraei frequently bury themselves in the substrate, we speculate that high gradient rivers may provide inferior habitat than low gradient rivers, because of larger substrate particles that may lead to higher mortality because of rocks moving. Indeed, in the southern portion of their Chilean range, H. macraei are either mostly found in lakes within R ́ıo Baker or only in the upper reaches of the R ́ıo Ayse ́n, which has a lower stream gradient. Hatcheria macraei tend to be locally common at those sites, but otherwise, it tends to be rare in Chile. This species also has broad environmental tolerances and occurs in most habitats from small headwater streams to large low elevation rivers near the coast as well as some lakes over a variety of substrates, especially gravel and rocks. In streams, they are often associated with riffles and runs (Arratia & Menu-Marque 1981; Barriga & Battini 2009). It is possible that they are more commonly found in lakes than current records suggest (e.g. Baigu ́n & Ferriz 2003; Liotta 2006), as lakes are not usually sampled with equipment likely to catch H. macraei (e.g. fine meshed gill nets and electrofishing). Moreover, this species is likely difficult to collect in lakes given that it buries itself in the substrate. Specific data for lower water temperature tolerances in H. macraei are lacking, but this species can tolerate temperatures within a couple of degrees from freezing based on winter temperatures in streams they inhabit. The widespread occurrence of H. macraei, in both headwater and lowland habitats, suggests that H. macraei could take advantages of opportunities to move between river basins in either headwaters or river termini.
We sampled H. macraei from 38 locations that span the entire distribution of this species in Chile and Argentina (Table 1, Fig. 1). Our mtDNA sampling ranged from one to 13 individuals per locality, with most sites represented by eight individuals, for a total of 260 fish. We also included individuals from the species Trichomycterus areolatus based on their close relationships to H. macraei in our previous work on this group of catfishes (Unmack et al. 2009b).
DNA isolation, amplification and sequencing
We extracted genomic DNA from muscle tissue from each specimen using the DNeasy Tissue kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth CA, USA). We amplified the mtDNA gene cytochrome b (cytb) gene using two primers that flanked this gene: Glu31 5¢-TGRCTTGAAAAAC-
CACCGTTGT-3¢ and Cat.Thr29 5¢-ACCTTCGATC TCCTGATTACAAGAC-3¢ (Unmack et al. 2009b). Final concentrations for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) components per 25-lL reaction were as follows: 25-ng template DNA, 0.25 lM of each primer, 0.625 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.1 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 lL of 10X reaction buffer and 2.5mM MgCl2. Amplification parameters were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min followed by35cyclesof94°Cfor30s,48°Cfor30s,and72°C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 7 min. We examined PCR products on a 1% agarose gel using SYBR safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). We purified PCR products using a Montage PCR 96 plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Most sequencing reactions and cleanup were performed using a Parallab 350 robot (Parallabs, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA). Some sequences were also obtained via cycle sequencing with Big Dye 3.0 dye terminator ready reaction kits using 1 ⁄ 16th reaction size (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequencing reactions were run with an annealing temperature of 52 °C following the ABI manufacturer’s protocol. We purified sequenced products using sephadex columns. Sequences were obtained using an Applied Biosystems 3730 XL automated sequencer at the Brigham Young University DNA Sequencing Center. All haplotypes obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank accession numbers JN186346–JN186408 (all GenBank numbers used in this study are listed by individual in Table S1, Supporting information). Data files containing all individuals sequenced, all haplotypes included in our phylogenetic analysis and our Arlequin input files were deposited in Dryad, doi:10.5061/ dryad.1t67j57q.
Analysis of mtDNA sequence data
Sequences were edited using Chromas Lite 2.0 (Technelysium, Tewantin, Queensland, Australia) and imported into BioEdit 7.0.5.2 (Hall 1999) then aligned by eye. All sequences were checked for unexpected frame shift errors or stop codons in Mega 4.0 (Tamura et al. 2007). Editing resulted in a 1137-base pair (bp) fragment of cytb for each individual included in our study. We used multiple analytical approaches to test the two hypotheses evaluated in this study. We first employed traditional tree-based phylogenetic analyses [maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP)] to see whether populations that occupy adjacent drainages across the Andes form distinct phylogenetic clades. These analyses generate bifurcating trees that are useful for identifying deeper patterns of evolutionary divergence among clades. For ML analysis, we used RAxML 7.2.3 (Stamatakis 2006a; Stamatakis et al. 2008) by bootstrapping with 10 000 replicates using GTRCAT

model (Stamatakis 2006b) with the final best ML tree being calculated using the GTRGAMMA model on the CIPRES cluster at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Data were separated into two partitions, first plus second codon positions, and third codon position. Trees were rooted with three representatives from the species Trichomycterus areolatus (taken from clade C in the phylogeny of Unmack et al. 2009b). The ML tree was deposited in TreeBASE, accession number TB2:S12065, (http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/ TB2:S12065). For MP, we only estimated robustness of nodes using TNT 1.1 (Goloboff et al. 2008). We con-
ducted standard bootstrapping with a traditional tree search starting with Wagner trees with 10 random additions of taxa and TBR branch swapping for 10 000 replicates. For MP, we designated one individual of T. areolatus from clade C as the outgroup as TNT only allows a single outgroup to be defined. We also used a haplotype network reconstruction to resolve shallow relationships among closely related haplotypes (Crandall 1994). We used TCS 1.21 (Clement et al. 2000) to create a network of the cytb haplotypes using statistical parsimony with a 95% probability that no multiple substitutions had occurred.

We used several approaches to estimate patterns of historical gene flow. We first used an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA; Excoffier et al. 2005) to determine how genetic variation is partitioned among populations. If gene flow has occurred between adjacent Pacific and Atlantic rivers as predicted, then we expect to find lower levels of genetic structuring between these drainages than other comparisons. If gene flow has been limited between Atlantic or Pacific drainage basins, then we expect to find higher levels of genetic structuring among populations across contemporary drainages. We first combined populations into 10 groups that coincide with the 11 drainage basins (Table 1) from which Hatcheria macraei were collected (the single sample from Bueno basin was combined with Valdivia basin for all analyses because it was geographically proximate and only 1 bp different). We also ran a second analysis consisting of only individuals from ‘‘Big Clade’’ which is defined in Fig. 2. This was because our phylogenetic analysis suggested that most differences found in the first AMOVA were driven by the two highly divergent lineages, but that for most of the study area (nine of 11 river basins), lower structure existed between these rivers. A third series of analysis compared each Atlantic drainage to each Pacific drainage within Big Clade to determine which comparisons had the lowest amonggroup values. A fourth analysis examined north-south patterns between Atlantic and Pacific basins respectively within Big Clade, as well as comparing populations in the Baker⁄Cholila clade, to contrast north-south gene flow to Atlantic-Pacific comparisons. All analyses were executed in the program Arlequin 3.5.1.2 (Excoffier et al. 2005) with significance assessed using 103 random permutations of the data set. We also estimated mutation–scaled migration rates using the program Migrate-n 3.2.6 (Beerli 2009). All but one comparison was limited to populations from Big Clade (i.e. not R ́ıo Baker, Lago Cholila or R ́ıo Colorado) because our phylogenetic and AMOVA analyses clearly demonstrated a long-term lack of gene flow. As per the AMOVA analyses, the single Bueno basin sample was combined with Valdivia basin for all analyses. We compared genetic exchange between Pacific and Atlantic drainages by determining whether migration rates were highest among adjacent drainages relative to nonadjacent comparisons. We estimated migration rates from two Atlantic drainages (R ́ıo Negro and R ́ıo Chubut) into each Pacific drainage as well as between all Pacific drainages. We also compared migration rates between R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila (which are not part of Big Clade). Because of the practical constraints on the number of populations that can be compared in a single Migrate-n

Fig. 2 Maximum likelihood phylogram of Hatcheria macraei haplotypes generated from 1137 base pairs of the cytochrome b gene. The phylogeny includes 73 haplotypes of H. macraei as well as several representatives of Trichomycterus areolatus. Branch lengths were estimated via maximum likelihood using RAxML under the GTRGAMMA model of evolution. Bootstrap values shown are derived from maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses (listed in that order) based on 10 000 pseudoreplicates each. The dashed bootstrap value indicates support less than 50%. Details for each H. macraei haplotype including locations where haplotypes are found and the number of individuals with that haplotype are found in Table S1, Supporting information and Fig. 3. Haplotype numbers and clade designations for T. areolatus are from Unmack et al. (2009b), and the equivalent haplotype designations used in Unmack et al. (2009b) for H. macraei are indicated in parentheses after the haplotype number used in the current study. Note that Unmack et al. (2009b) labelled all of the H. macraei samples as being part of Clade G, but here, we only label the specific T. areolatus samples as being from Clade G.

run, we used a migration matrix to limit comparisons in the Atlantic-Pacific analysis. We only examined migration from Atlantic rivers into Pacific rivers (i.e. not the reverse direction as populations should have been extirpated by glaciation), in both directions only between adjacent Atlantic rivers (i.e. not between R ́ıo Negro and R ́ıo Deseado) and adjacent Pacific rivers, and we excluded R ́ıo Deseado in comparisons with Pacific basins as the AMOVA and genetic distance results were all consistent with a lack of similarity to any Pacific basin relative to R ́ıo Negro and R ́ıo Chubut. Using Migrate-n, we estimated effective population sizes and past migration rates between populations using Bayesian inference. We used uniform priors and metropolis sampling with one long chain and a sample increment of 1000 for 50 000 samples, with 100 000 samples discarded as initial burn-in. Each analysis started with random seed values from the system clock and used an adaptive heating scheme (1, 1.5, 3.0, 10 000). We ran Migrate-n multiple times to verify the consistency of our results. The results presented represent an average of the median, 50% and 95% credibility interval values from three runs. To provide an alternative comparison of genetic distinctiveness, we used Mega to calculate the average number of nucleotide differences between and within drainages and Arlequin to calculate Fst values between drainages. For both measures, if adjacent Pacific-Atlantic drainages have recently experienced gene flow, then genetic divergence between those drainages should be lower than comparisons between nonadjacent Pacific-Atlantic basins. Additionally, if gene flow among Atlantic river basins is lower than between Atlantic and adjacent Pacific drainages, then genetic divergences should be higher.
Results
The phylogenetic results for cytb demonstrate that H. macraei is composed of three clades with distinct geographic distributions (Fig. 2). We found 73 haplotypes of H. macraei (Fig. 2; Table S2, Supporting information). Of the 1137 bp sequenced, 1003 characters were invariant, 52 characters were variable, but parsimony uninformative and 82 characters were parsimony informative. Maximum likelihood recovered one tree from the mtDNA analysis with a likelihood score of )2783.332004 (Fig. 2). Six deep nodes in the tree were well resolved with strong support (Hillis & Bull 1993) evidenced by ML bootstrap values > 74. MP provided similar support at three deeper nodes, one node had low support and two deeper nodes had no support (Fig. 2). Most shallow nodes had similar support from ML and MP (Fig. 2). The three well-supported clades within H. macraei were designated as Colorado,
Baker ⁄ Cholila and Big Clade (Fig. 2). The mean between clade p-distance varied from 1.4–1.7%, which is consistent with long-term isolation between them. However, most of the genetic variation within clade was low (mean p-distance of 0.2–0.3%). The Colorado and Baker ⁄ Cholila clades have 15 and 10 haplotypes, respectively, but these two clades have limited geographic ranges. Individuals within the Baker ⁄ Cholila clade had a disjunct distribution, with closely related haplotypes being shared between R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila (Fig. 2). Lago Cholila occurs in the R ́ıo Yelcho, three rivers north of R ́ıo Baker (Fig. 1). The Big Clade contained 48 of the 73 haplotypes, with many similar or shared haplotypes among rivers spanning a vast region that includes all but two drainage basins. Several T. areolatus individuals were nested within H. macraei, likely as a result of repeated historical mitochondrial introgression (see below; Unmack et al. 2009b). Relationships between the three H. macraei clades and T. areolatus from clade G were more strongly resolved for ML, but had little support from MP (Fig. 2).
The haplotype network provides finer details of the similarities among drainage systems and patterns of haplotype sharing within each clade (Fig. 3). Of the 48 Big Clade haplotypes, six were shared between two rivers, one between three rivers and one between five rivers. Five of these shared haplotypes are the most common ones found, ranging from 15 to 41 individuals and accounting for 114 of 205 individuals from Big Clade. The most common haplotype 12 was shared between five rivers (Deseado, 23 individuals, Negro, 10, Ayse ́ n, 4, Chubut and Puelo, two each). Two other haplotypes, 37 and 46, were also shared between R ́ıo Chubut and Negro with haplotype 37 being more common in R ́ıo Negro (eight of nine individuals), and haplotype 46 was more common in R ́ıo Chubut (16 of 18 individuals). All R ́ıo Negro haplotypes were closely related to the common haplotypes 12 and 37 while all R ́ıo Chubut haplotypes were closely related to common haplotypes 37 and 46 (Fig. 3). R ́ıo Colorado had high genetic diversity with 15 haplotypes found out of 24 individuals despite sampling only three populations. R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila shared one common haplotype, but otherwise, the four Cholila haplotypes were all closely related, while R ́ıo Baker contained seven haplotypes (Fig. 3).
Results from our AMOVA analyses are mostly consistent with our hypotheses that Pacific rivers were colonized from their adjacent Atlantic river and that movement among Atlantic and northern Pacific rivers was more restricted. Pairwise comparison of amonggroup variation between Atlantic-Pacific drainages found that R ́ıo Chubut had the lowest values with each Pacific basin relative to R ́ıo Negro with one exception,

    Fig. 3 Haplotype network of cytochrome b for the three clades within Hatcheria macraei: Colorado (upper portion), Big Clade (middle) and Baker⁄Cholila (lower). Each haplotype is colourcoded based on the drainage(s) where it occurs. The key to river colours is presented in the upper left corner. Rivers are listed in their geographic order from north to south from the Pacific and Atlantic drainages. Details for the specific geographic location for each H. macraei haplotype are found in Table S1, Supporting information. Circle size represents haplotype abundance; the key to circle size is in the lower right corner. Haplotype counts > 4 are given in parentheses after the haplotype number. Unsampled haplotypes are represented by small open circles. We did not show the network connection between Baker, Colorado and Big clades; however, they all link together via the Trichomycterus areolatus haplotype 117 at the 95% connection threshold.
     R ́ıo Ayse ́n, which was lowest with R ́ıo Negro (Table 2). R ́ıo Deseado (Atlantic) and R ́ıo Valdivia (northern Pacific) always had the highest values in all comparisons between Atlantic and Pacific basins, which reflects their greater geographic isolation as they occur on the southeastern and north-western edges of the range of H. macraei (Fig. 1). Atlantic basin among-group comparisons were higher (Table 2) than those between R ́ıo
Chubut and each adjacent Pacific basin consistent with a higher degree of isolation between them. Pacific basin comparisons were high when R ́ıo Valdivia was included (51.0%), but considerably lower when excluded (25.5%, Table 2) which is also consistent with a higher degree of isolation for that basin. R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila had high among-group structure (48.9%), which is consistent with longer-term isolation between them. When the entire data set from all 11 drainage basins is examined, H. macraei populations appear to be highly structured by river basin (66.7%, Table 2). However, when the distinct clades from Colorado and Baker⁄Cholila are removed, then populations are substantially less structured (39.0%, Table 2), which is consistent with the phylogenetic results (Fig. 2).
Results from our Migrate-n analysis are also mostly consistent with our Pacific-Atlantic colonization hypotheses. We also found that movement among Atlantic rivers was more restricted than between Pacific-Atlantic basins. Pairwise comparison of mutation-scaled migration rates from R ́ıo Negro and R ́ıo Chubut into each Pacific drainage demonstrates that in most cases, values were highest from R ́ıo Chubut (Table 3). One exception to this pattern was R ́ıo Ayse ́n that had higher values from R ́ıo Negro, although R ́ıo Chubut values were only slightly less. R ́ıo Valdivia, the northern most Pacific river, overall had very low migration rates (Table 3), which is consistent with its distant geographic separation from both Atlantic rivers. Within Atlantic drainages, R ́ıo Chubut and R ́ıo Negro both had the lowest mutation-scaled migration values found between adjacent rivers, while values between R ́ıo Chubut and R ́ıo Deseado were lower than all but one adjacent PacificAtlantic comparison (Table 3). All Pacific basin comparisons had high migration values that are consistent with their common colonization source primarily from R ́ıo Chubut (Table 3).
Pairwise comparison of genetic diversity is also broadly consistent with our hypothesis that Pacific rivers are most similar to the adjacent Atlantic drainage within Big Clade. Average pairwise nucleotide differences were generally low within the Big Clade, with values ranging from 1.4 to 7.2, but were much higher between the Big Clade, Colorado and Baker ⁄ Cholila clades (Table 4). When genetic differences were compared between each Atlantic drainage and each Pacific drainage within Big Clade, all Pacific drainages, except R ́ıo Ayse ́n, were more similar to R ́ıo Chubut than to R ́ıo Negro, although in many cases, the differences were relatively small. R ́ıo Ayse ́n though was more similar to R ́ıo Deseado, then R ́ıo Negro and then R ́ıo Chubut (Table 4). The remaining Pacific drainages all had large differences to R ́ıo Deseado that were greater than their differences with R ́ıo Negro and R ́ıo Chubut. Simi-

Tests include the entire data set, Big Clade and pairwise comparisons within Big Clade between each Atlantic and Pacific drainage (listed from north to south) as well as between Atlantic basins and Pacific basins. An asterisk after the among-groups category indicates the result was significant (P < 0.05). The total genetic variation in the data set is partitioned into three categories: among groups, among populations within groups, and within populations. Total genetic variation sums to 100%.
larly, R ́ıo Valdivia and R ́ıo Bueno had consistently higher levels of differences within Big Clade consistent with their geographic isolation. A similar pattern was present in the Fst values, with the three clades all being quite distinct from each other (Table 4). There was considerable variation in the Fst values between drainages within the Big Clade, although when Pacific and Atlantic drainages were compared, the two more northerly Pacific drainages (R ́ıo Valdivia and R ́ıo Bueno) were equallydifferenttoR ́ıoNegroandR ́ıoChubut,whereas R ́ıo Puelo, R ́ıo Yelcho and R ́ıo Palena were all most similar to R ́ıo Chubut, while R ́ıo Ayse ́n was most similar to R ́ıo Negro, and all Pacific drainages were quite different to R ́ıo Deseado (Table 4). R ́ıo Valdivia and R ́ıo Bueno also had consistently high levels of difference relative to most pairwise comparisons within Big Clade consistent with their geographic isolation. Within-population genetic diversity was low (0.3–1.8) in all Pacific drainages except R ́ıo Ayse ́n and R ́ıo Baker (3.3 and 2.8, respectively), while in the Atlantic drain-
ages, R ́ıo Deseado had a lower value (0.3) with the remaining basins all having higher diversity (2.3–3.0, Table 4).
Discussion
In this study, we examine historical patterns of Hatcheria macraei movement among river basins in Patagonia. We evaluate the predictions that earth history events have promoted more recent population movement between Pacific and Atlantic drainages, but have limited movement among populations that occupy rivers that drain to the Atlantic Ocean as well as the northern Pacific basins. We discuss each of these topics in turn.

for recent genetic exchange among Hatcheria macraei populations in adjacent Atlantic and Pacific river drainages. Presumably this occurred when the glaciers receded and drainage returned to the Pacific Ocean around 13 000 years ago (Tatur et al. 2002; Turner et al. 2005). Despite strong geological evidence for recent connections to Atlantic basins, R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila contained a quite divergent lineage. R ́ıo Ayse ́ n displayed an atypical pattern of close relationships to multiple Atlantic basins as well as high genetic diversity (Table 4). In comparisons of AMOVAs, migration rates andgeneticdistances,R ́ıoChubutwasalwaysclosestto theadjacentPacificbasinsofR ́ıoYelchoandR ́ıoPalena (Tables 2, 3 and 4). The other two adjacent Pacific basins, R ́ıo Ayse ́n and R ́ıo Puelo, also showed close relationships with R ́ıo Chubut, but they were also close to R ́ıo Negro (Tables 2, 3 and 4). R ́ıo Ayse ́n had a different pattern to all other Pacific drainage basins—most haplotypes within this river were not closely related to each other, except for haplotypes 20 and 24 which were one step apart (Fig. 3). Migration rates to R ́ıo Ayse ́n were high from both R ́ıo Chubut and R ́ıo Negro (Table 3), and genetic divergence values of R ́ıo Ayse ́n were similar to all three Atlantic rivers (Table 4). Comparison of among-group AMOVA values (Table 2) was lower between R ́ıo Ayse ́n and R ́ıo Negro than R ́ıo Chubut, as were Fst values (Table 4). Given that R ́ıo Ayse ́n is quite geographically distant from R ́ıo Negro (Fig. 1), it seems likely that the unusual mix of haplotypes present in R ́ıo Ayse ́n is driving the apparent close relationship to R ́ıo Negro as all haplotypes in R ́ıo Ayse ́n are closely related to haplotypes from R ́ıo Chubut, but two of those haplotypes (12 and 37) are far more common in R ́ıo Negro (Fig. 3). R ́ıo Puelo is adjacent to both the Chubut and Negro basins and also had a historical paleolake connection with R ́ıo Negro (Tatur et al. 2002). R ́ıo Puelo had similar migration rates from R ́ıo Chubut and R ́ıo Negro (Table 3) as well as shared haplotypes with both (Fig. 3). These patterns are consistent with both R ́ıo Negro and R ́ıo Chubut contributing to the recolonization of R ́ıo Puelo. All of the other species studied from Negro basin (Percichthys trucha, Galaxias maculatus and Galaxias platei) show a close relationship to Puelo basin based on shared or similar haplotypes (Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010).
We found one quite unexpected phylogeographic result. R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila clearly represent an exception to the predicted pattern that adjacent eastwest drainages would be similar. R ́ıo Baker contains a divergent lineage that is otherwise only found further north in Lago Cholila (Yelcho drainage, Fig. 1). Despite clear evidence for recent drainage reversals because of glacial damming in the R ́ıo Baker (Turner et al. 2005;
Bell 2008; Hein et al. 2010), we do not find support for either movement of Hatcheria macraei from R ́ıo Baker into R ́ıo Deseado or from R ́ıo Deseado into R ́ıo Baker once drainage returned to the Pacific Ocean around 12.8 ka. A second aspect that is puzzling is the lack of the Baker ⁄ Cholila clade in R ́ıo Deseado. Most records of H. macraei today from R ́ıo Baker are from east of the Andes Mountains, and presumably they were present there prior to the last glaciation. Glaciation should, in theory, push those populations eastward into Atlantic drainages during the process of drainage reversal (see Introduction). This of course assumes that they are able to survive the changes associated with this series of events. Perhaps they were present in R ́ıo Deseado, but were subsequently replaced by the Big Clade lineage. However, no genetic evidence of such replacement exists. Similar issues exist relative to explaining the existence of the Lago Cholila population as well as explaining their close relationship with R ́ıo Baker, which is separated by several river basins and deeper ocean channels that would make movement between the two areas difficult. It remains unclear as to why this lineage is restricted to Lago Cholila and that it is not present in other nearby populations sampled (pops. 30– 31) in same river basin (Yelcho), especially because there are no obvious downstream barriers that may prevent migration. Detailed examination of geographically intermediate populations would be helpful to further address this question. The persistence of the Baker ⁄ Cholila lineage seems difficult to explain without the presence of local refugia within the glaciated area. Ultimately though, lacking further information, we can only speculate on the potential history of the Baker ⁄ Cholila lineage.
North-south Atlantic drainage relationships. While we found support consistent with our prediction for reduced genetic exchange (relative to Atlantic-Pacific comparisons) among Hatcheria macraei populations in adjacent Atlantic river drainages, overall the degree of genetic differences was low between most basins. Of the four Atlantic drainages, R ́ıo Colorado had the strongest evidence for long-term isolation from other basins (Fig. 2). At least one other fish, Percichthys trucha, appears to have recently exchanged individuals between R ́ıo Colorado and R ́ıo Negro (Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011). Thus, given the widespread nature and abundance of H. macraei, it is surprising that we find no evidence for their movement between R ́ıo Colorado andR ́ıoNegro.
Populations in the remaining three basins, Negro, Chubut and Deseado, have all experienced more recent genetic exchange, although not as recent as the Atlantic-Pacific exchanges. Among group AMOVA values are

all higher between Atlantic rivers than comparisons with Pacific basins (except R ́ıo Valdivia; Table 2). Migration values between R ́ıo Negro and R ́ıo Chubut were low relative to other pairwise comparisons between Atlantic and Pacific basins (Table 3). Migration values between R ́ıo Chubut and R ́ıo Deseado were higher, but still less than most Pacific-Atlantic values. Only three of a total of 38 haplotypes are shared between these Atlantic basins; however, they are the first, second and forth most abundant haplotypes present in Atlantic rivers as well as occurring at ancestral positions relative to other related haplotypes (haplotypes 12, 46 and 37, respectively; Figs 2 and 3). Thus, only common ancestral haplotypes are shared between the basins, which suggests that recent gene exchange has been limited as demonstrated by the lack of shared derived haplotypes (Fig. 3).
None of these basins have experienced connections related to glacial paleolakes diverting flow across drainage basin boundaries, as any glaciers would have been concentrated on the highest elevations that represent the actual drainage divide in this region. These basins also become quite arid and lack any permanent or significant aquatic habitats along their drainage divides within a short distance of their headwaters. Lowland connections between these basins today seem unlikely as each river is separated by vast areas of desert. However, it seems likely that connections between some of these rivers could occur during low sea levels. Indeed, this was the principal suggestion to explain the low phylogeographic structure across Atlantic basins in P. trucha (Ruzzante et al. 2011). Eastern Argentina has a continental shelf that extends several hundred kilometres east which was exposed during low sea levels (Ponce et al. 2011). The three northern river mouths (Colorado, Negro and Chubut) are all relatively close to one another (Fig. 1), and it is likely that at different times, there may have been connections between them on the continental shelf. The continental shelf has a relatively low gradient which would be conducive to rivers changing course (Ponce et al. 2011). Vast amounts of fluvial sediment deposits exist which were associated with braided river channels that tend to migrate around on floodplains. In addition, much higher flows existed during deglaciation, all of which may have of enhanced the potential for riverine connections (Mart ́ınez & Kutschker 2011; Ponce et al. 2011; Ruzzante et al. 2011). R ́ıo Deseado though is considerably more distant to the northern rivers (Fig. 1), making connections between them less likely, although we cannot fully rule out that possibility.
Other potential connections may have existed in headwater regions between Atlantic basins as well. The only region where headwater streams in the R ́ıo Negro
and R ́ıo Chubut are close is in the vicinity of Bariloche between the upper Arroyo Las Bayas (pop. 11, Chubut drainage), Arroyo Pichi Leufu ́ and Arroyo Comallo at Comallo (pops. 8 and 9, Negro drainage, Fig. 1). This is an area with only minimal topographic separation between these watersheds, which during wetter periods or extreme rainfall events, could potentially be traversed by fishes. Certainly, during deglaciation, the area would have been considerably wetter from ice melt based on the presence of more extensive terminal paleolakes in valley floors in nearby closed basins (Tatur et al. 2002). This appears to be the only likely location where gene flow could have occurred between the headwaters of these drainage basins. Potential connections between the headwaters of R ́ıo Chubut and R ́ıo Deseado seem limited. There is only an extremely small region where the headwaters are close to one another and that region today is arid and lacks significant permanent water. During deglaciation, the area should have been wetter, thus potentially facilitating movement. Connections across the current lowland regions seem unlikely due to the vast distances between drainages and lack of aquatic habitats.
North-south Pacific drainage relationships. We expected to find a close relationship between glaciated Pacific rivers (R ́ıoPuelosouth)becausetheywereallthoughttohave been recently recolonized from adjacent Atlantic rivers. We have already discussed the exception of populations from R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila to this pattern of recolonization; thus, we limit the following comparisons to Pacific populations within Big Clade. Our data broadly support the conclusion that each was colonized separately and that recent mixing between them seems unlikely based upon their geological history. All of the most common haplotypes found in each Pacific drainage are shared with different R ́ıo Chubut haplotypes, but only two haplotypes are shared between multiple Pacificdrainages,haplotype28fromR ́ıoYelcho,R ́ıoPalena and R ́ıo Chubut and haplotype 12 from R ́ıo Ayse ́n, R ́ıo Puelo and three Atlantic drainages (Fig. 3). Most other haplotypes are one base pair distant from these common haplotypes (Fig. 3). Most Fst and migration values between central Pacific drainages were higher thanvaluesbetweenR ́ıoChubutandeachPacificdrainage, while average nucleotide differences were typically similar within and between Pacific drainages and R ́ıo Chubut (Tables 3 and 4).
One perplexing result was the close relationship of a unique lineage within the glaciated region consisting of R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila. These are separated by three Pacific drainages (Ayse ́ n, Cisnes and Puelo). Despite this distance and lack of geographically intermediate populations, the two shared one haplotype

(Fig. 3); however, most measures suggest gene flow has been limited for some time between them. Between-group AMOVA results explained 48.9% of the variation between the two (Table 2), while the mean number of pairwise differences and Fst values were high relative to most within Big Clade comparisons (Table 4). In contrast, pairwise calculation of migration values tended to be high relative to other comparisons (Table 3). Overall though, most evidence is consistent with the two populations having been isolated from each other for some time.
The northernmost Pacific rivers (R ́ıo Valdivia and R ́ıo Bueno) are somewhat genetically differentiated from all other Big Clade populations, which is consistent with their greater geographic isolation. They were separated by two to five base pairs from haplotypes 5 and 37 (Fig. 3). Among-group AMOVA values for Pacific drainages were 25.5% lower when northern basins were excluded (Table 2). Mean number of base pair differences were highest between these northern Pacific basins and all other Big Clade basins, while Fst values were all high relative to most within Big Clade comparisons (Table 4). These results suggest that these populations were not influenced by any potential headwater drainage reversals (e.g. via Lago La ́car in the headwater of Valdivia basin which is east of the Andes Mountains). While our result of great isolation for northern Pacific rivers is consistent with our expectation, the fact that their differences were not greater is surprising when contrasted with the closely related Trichomycterus areolatus. Both species are sympatric in the southern portion of the range of T. areolatus as well as having similar ecological attributes (Unmack et al. 2009a,b). However, T. areolatus populations from R ́ıo Bueno southwere3.3–4.8%divergentfromthoseinR ́ıoBueno north (Unmack et al. 2009b), vs. two to five base pairs of difference in Hatcheria macraei (Fig. 3). Presumably there must be some ecological or physiological attributes that perhaps can account for these differences in movements into previously glaciated drainages. Whatever the case, this remains an important question to address to better understand the biogeographic patterns within this region.
Are drainage reversals the best explanation for eastwest movement?
Drainage reversals have typically been given as the most likely explanation for the close faunal and molecular relationships between fishes in Atlantic and Pacific drainages (Cussac et al. 2004; Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010). Clearly, molecular data from all fishes examined so far (e.g. Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010) demonstrate the same
pattern of close relationships between populations from Pacific and Atlantic drainages, thus unmistakably the fish fauna in most Pacific rivers was almost certainly derived from Atlantic rivers since deglaciation. Other than the R ́ıo Negro–R ́ıo Puelo and R ́ıo Baker–R ́ıo Deseado connections, no paleolakes have been specifically identified from the region between R ́ıo Chubut and the adjacent Pacific drainages, although many parts of the region remain poorly studied geomorphologically. It is clear though that considerable glacial meltwater flowed to the Atlantic either directly from glaciers or via proglacial lakes (Mart ́ınez & Kutschker 2011) that may have facilitated movement between R ́ıo Chubut and Pacific drainages as glaciers receded. The general broader role that paleolakes and glacial meltwater played in exchanging faunas remains somewhat unclear though, especially given that one of the best-documented examples of extensive drainage reversal between R ́ıo Baker and R ́ıo Deseado did not appear to result in the transfer of Hatcheria macraei in either direction. In contrast, movement in all of the species studied to date in the upper Negro basin into the Puelo basin is consistent with drainage reversal evidence (Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008). However, it is unclear as to what, if any portion of the fish fauna lived in these paleolakes as they would have been very cold and difficult places to live. Unfortunately, fossil evidence of fishes from these lakes appears to be lacking. Perhaps H. macraei (and possibly other species) were not present in these paleolakes. Lack of evidence of Baker ⁄ Cholila clade in R ́ıo Deseado suggests that H. macraei was not present. If H. macraei was unable to live in these paleolakes, then what role, if any, did other potential paleolakes and glacial meltwater drainage reversals play in the colonization of Pacific rivers across all species?
At least two alternative explanations to drainage reversals exist to explain the faunal similarity between Atlantic and Pacific drainages. Some preglacial drainage basin boundaries probably changed via drainage rearrangement because of the massive modifications as the landscape readjusted after the last glacial maximum. This can be caused by changes related to terminal moraines, glacial isostatic adjustment, tectonism, climate, base level changes associated with different lake levels, etc. For instance, Mardones et al. (2007) provided evidence for drainage rearrangement in the upper R ́ıo Ayse ́n, portions of which were suggested to have been captured from Chubut drainage within the last few thousand years. This may have been responsible for transferring fishes and could explain the presence of the only population of the freshwater crab, Aegla neuquensis found in Pacific basins (Valdovinos et al. 2010) that are otherwise widespread throughout the Negro

and Chubut drainages (which begs the question as to why A. neuquensis was not transferred to Pacific basins during drainage reversals?). Geomorphological research in New Zealand has recorded a number of drainage rearrangements associated with the effects of glacial outwash transportation and deposition (Craw et al. 2007). It seems reasonable to suggest that similar processes are likely to operate in other glaciated portions of the world including Patagonia. A second alternative explanation is that flat headwater regions with no or low drainage divides could facilitate fish movement between river basins during extreme rainfall events (e.g. Thacker et al. 2007). Essentially, these flat regions are common in Patagonia as previous glacial advances often removed potential topographic barriers. These shallow divides complicate efforts to determine the means by which fishes moved between basins as there is no way to easily discriminate between movement via paleolake reversals or across shallow drainage divides. In addition, these two features often occur in the same geographic location. We can only speculate on the most likely cause of faunal exchange in the absence of more conclusive evidence (e.g. fossil fishes from paleolake deposits, physiological tolerance data, etc.). Ultimately, it seems possible that the fish fauna could have used multiple routes to move between Atlantic and Pacific drainages, rather than just one. It is important to remember that molecular data can only inform us of past connections, but they cannot explain how they got there.
Within glacier refugia
The near complete glaciation of Pacific river basins (Fig. 1; Hulton et al. 2002; Singer et al. 2004) should have extirpated most, if not all of the terrestrial and aquatic fauna from this region. Se ́rsic et al. (2011) summarized the results from 33 molecular studies of terrestrial plants and animals from Patagonia and found reasonable congruence in the locations of suggested glacial refuges either along the edge of glaciated regions, or in the more distant lowlands. Most aquatic studies suggest current-day populations appear to have recolonized from refugia east or north of the glaciated region (e.g. Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010). However, the existence of a unique clade in Hatcheria macraei from R ́ıo Baker and Lago Cholila (Fig. 2) suggests that one or more refugia within the glaciated area may have existed for considerable time (i.e. the last several glaciations). The presence of this unique lineage in Pacific drainages is perplexing as it contradicts current geological evidence of an ice sheet covering the entire region (Hulton et al. 2002; Singer et al. 2004), as well as being differ-
ent to molecular results found for most other aquatic and terrestrial groups that all appear to have recolonized from refugia east or north of the glaciated region (e.g. Ruzzante et al. 2006, 2011; Zemlak et al. 2008, 2010; Se ́rsic et al. 2011). Only two examples exist that suggest refugia may have been present within the glaciated region. The first is the presence of fossil flightless beetles on Isla Wellington (49° S) 􏰁13 000 years ago which suggests the presence of a local refugium given they should be quite dispersal limited (Ashworth et al. 1991). The second is phylogeographic patterns in the freshwater crab Aegla alacalufi which is widespread on coastal islands and the lower reaches of Pacific drainages within the glaciated area as well as nonglaciated islands along the western edge of Chile (Xu et al. 2009). Populations on nonglaciated offshore islands were quite different to each other, but did not serve as local refugia for current populations within the glaciated region. Results based upon high levels of genetic diversity as well as the degree of genetic divergence suggested the persistence of at least one or two refugia within the glaciated region in different locations to those proposed for Hatcheria macraei (Xu et al. 2009).
Conclusions
Southern South America provides a novel environment for examining Southern Hemisphere phylogeography and the recolonization of glaciated areas. Extensive glaciation is thought to have extirpated the entire fauna from this region. Because of the topographic configuration, glaciation resulted in Pacific draining rivers being diverted by glacial dams into Atlantic drainages. Once the glaciers melted, rivers returned to the Pacific Ocean. These drainage reversals potentially facilitated recolonization of Pacific basins along with drainage rearrangements and flat drainage divides. We found a close relationship between populations from most adjacent Pacific-Atlantic drainages; although the southern pair of R ́ıo Baker and R ́ıo Deseado did not fit this pattern, nor did the Lago Cholila population. Populations in most Atlantic drainages have experienced lower genetic exchange relative to that between Pacific and Atlantic basins. However, genetic exchange between three of the four Atlantic rivers was still quite high with the exception of R ́ıo Colorado, which showed evidence for longterm isolation. Overall, we found high levels of genetic exchange in nine of 11 river basins implying that drainage basin boundaries have not played an important long-term role in structuring populations, which is somewhat unusual within freshwater biogeography at such a broad scale.
