Abstract
Historical drainage patterns adjacent to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau differed markedly from those of today. We examined the relationship between drainage history and geographic patterns of genetic variation in the Yunnan spiny frog, Nanorana yunnanensis, using approximately 981 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA partial sequences from protein-coding genes ND1 and ND2, and intervening areas including complete tRNAIle, tRNAGln and tRNAMet. Two null hypotheses were tested: (i) that genetic patterns do not correspond to the development of drainage systems and (ii) that populations had been stable and not experienced population expansion, bottlenecking and selection. Genealogical analyses identified three, major, well-supported maternal lineages, each of which had two sublineages. These divergent lineages were completely concordant with six geographical regions. Genetic structure and divergence were strongly congruent with historical rather than contemporary drainage patterns. Most lineages and sublineages were formed via population fragmentation during the rearrangement of paleodrainage basins in the Early Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. Sympatric lineages occurred only in localities at the boundaries of major drainages, likely reflecting secondary contact of previously allopatric populations. Extensive population expansion probably occurred early in the Middle Pleistocene accompanying dramatic climatic oscillations.

Introduction
Genealogical analyses, including phylogeography, can discover mechanisms that shape genetic structure in natural populations. These mechanisms might promote future diversification and preserve the evolutionary potential of extant species (Moritz 2002). Mitochondrial

DNA (mtDNA) is often chosen as a marker in genealogical studies because it is inherited clonally through maternal lineages as a single linked locus. Gene flow and genetic recombination do not obscure its genealogical history. However, mtDNA has a smaller effective population size and it can provide only part of a species’ history (Zhang & Hewitt 2003; Ballard & Whitlock 2004). Thus, inferences on the history of species ⁄ populations should be taken with caution (Ballard & Whitlock 2004).
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and its adjacent areas span three biodiversity hotspots: Himalaya,

Indo-Burma and the mountains of southwestern China (Myers et al. 2000; Biodiversity-hotspots 2005). The QTP’s dramatic variation in climate and topography supports a wide array of habitats (Biodiversity-hotspots 2005) and forms a model ecosystem for investigating speciation. The Late Cenozoic uplifting of the QTP seems to be a main driving force for shaping the recent genetic structure and biodiversity of organisms in the region (e.g. Liu et al. 2006).
Being adjacent to the QTP, the Yunnan Plateau is extremely complex in topography and climate and of great interest to biologists and geologists alike. It increasingly plays an important role in revealing biological consequences of the Late Cenozoic orogenic events (Cheng et al. 2001). Different regions on the Yunnan Plateau responded uniquely to each period of uplifting, as did the evolution of paleo-drainage systems (Cheng et al. 2001).
Historically, drainage of the major continental East Asian rivers on the southeastern margin of the Tibet plateau differed markedly from their current directions (Ru ̈ber et al. 2004) (Fig. S1). On the Yunnan Plateau, river capture and reversal events occurred with the Late Cenozoic uplifting of QTP (Cheng et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004).
Previous investigations into freshwater fishes in China suggested that historical drainage rearrangements (e.g. basin connection, river reversal and river capture) generated genetic structure and biodiversity (e.g. Perdices et al. 2004, 2005; Yang et al. 2009). However, these studies mainly involved drainage basins outside of Yunnan province. Here, we investigate the association between drainage histories in areas adjacent to the QTP and mtDNA genetic structure in a species of dicroglossid frog, Nanorana yunnanensis.
Nanorana yunnanensis occurs in southwestern China (Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces), northern Vietnam and Myanmar and presumably in intervening Laos (Frost 2008). It has a low dispersal capability and shows a preference for living near moss-covered rocks in cold montane streams at higher elevations (from about 1500–2500 m; personal observations). These ecological features make N. yunnanensis an ideal species for investigating the genetic consequences of the geological history of drainage basins.
Our study provides the first test of the vicariance hypotheses for this region using a semi-aquatic anuran. Our null hypothesis states that geographic and genealogical histories correspond poorly to one another, i.e. that genetic patterns do not correspond to the development of drainage systems. If true, we expect to observe broadly mixed haplotype groups among nearby rivers, while allowing for isolation-by-distance. The null hypothesis is rejected upon discovering that lineage his-
tory corresponds to the historical development of drainage systems. If this null hypothesis is rejected, then a new hypothesis can be tested further. The new hypothesis states that genetic patterns correspond to geological history. Rejection of this hypothesis requires one of two explanations: either the geological history is inaccurate, or historically the frogs have dispersed. These two possibilities can be tested using several genetic predictions. An inaccurate geological history can be supported by discovering multiple taxa that have the same pattern of genealogical history, and dispersal can be identified by discovering genealogical relationships in the form of a Hennigean comb where relationships correspond with
geographic distance (e.g. Murphy 2002).
Materials and methods
Sampling
& Aguirre-Le ́ on
A total of 1193 individuals of N. yunnanensis were collected from 71 localities throughout the Chinese range plus one sample site from Vietnam (Table 1; Fig. 1). Sampling emphasized different river systems and mountain ranges, rather than from a same area. Sample sizes mostly range from 10 to 30 individuals per location depending on population density. Following approved Animal Use Protocols, five voucher specimens were collected from each locality with sample size ‡5. Toe clips taken for the remaining samples were preserved in 95% ethanol, and transferred and frozen at )80 °C in the laboratory; live frogs were then released. The sister taxa to N. yunnanensis, Nanorana quadranus and Nanorana unculuanus (Che et al. 2009) were used as outgroup taxa for genealogical reconstruction. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yunnan University and Sichuan University Museum (Table S1).
Laboratory procedures
Genomic DNA was extracted with proteinase K followed by the standard 3-step phenol-chloroform method (Sambrook et al. 1989). Partial segments of ND1 and ND2 (subunits one and two of NADH) genes and the three complete intervening tRNA genes were obtained for all individuals. PCR amplification used the primer combinations L3878 (Macey et al. 1998) and H4980 (Macey et al. 1997). Amplified fragments were sequenced with PCR primer combinations and an internal primer L4160 (Kumazawa & Nishida 1993). Amplification was conducted in a 25 lL volume reaction initiated at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1min, 46°C for 45s, 72°C for 1min and a

single final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Negative controls were run for all amplifications. PCR products were purified with Gel Extraction Mini kit (Watson BioTechnologies, Shanghai, China). The purified product was used as the template DNA for cycle sequencing reactions performed using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (version 2.0, Applied Biosystems), and sequencing was conducted on an ABI PRISM 3730 (Applied Biosystems) automatic DNA sequencer with both forward and reverse primers.
DNA sequence alignment
DNA sequences were edited using DNASTAR 5.0 (DNASTAR Inc.). Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal X 1.81 (Thompson et al. 1997) with default parameters and then revised by eye in MEGA 3.1 (Kumar et al. 2004). Protein-coding nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acid using MEGA 3.1 (Kumar et al. 2004) to confirm alignment. Alignments of tRNA sequences were constructed manually based on secondary structural models (Kumazawa & Nishida 1993) to ensure proper alignment (Macey & Verma 1997). Positions of ambiguous alignment and those from variable length intergenic regions were excluded from the analyses. No gaps existed in the final database of aligned sequences. Identical haplotypes were collapsed using DnaSP 4.10.4 (Rozas et al. 2003).
Genealogical reconstruction
Historical relationships among haplotypes were reconstructed using Bayesian inference (BI) as implemented in MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003), based on the HKY+I+G (Hasegawa et al. 1985) model of sequence evolution, as determined using ModelTest 3.7 (Posada & Crandall 1998). Two independent runs starting from different random trees were performed with four Markov chains. The analysis was run for 3 · 106 generations, and the chain was sampled every 100 generations. The first 8000 trees were discarded as burn-in, after the log-likelihood scores stabilized and average standard deviation of split frequencies approached zero. Convergence onto the stationary distribution between two independent runs was confirmed. A 50% majority rule consensus of the sampled trees was constructed to obtain Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) of the tree nodes.
Molecular diversity and genetic structure
ARLEQUIN 3.1 (Excoffier et al. 2005) was used in the analysis as follows. Molecular diversity indices were estimated for each sampled population with sample size
‡10 and for each lineage ⁄ sublineage. Population structure was measured by an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Excoffier et al. 1992) with significance assessed by 10 000 permutations. Populations were grouped according to either the mtDNA lineages identified by genealogical reconstruction, or major drainage basins. The most plausible geographical subdivision was assumed to be the one where among-group variation had the greatest statistical significance. Genetic differentiation among populations was evaluated by pairwise values of FST, and statistical significance was assessed by 10 000 permutations. Both AMOVA and FST used Tamura & Nei (1993) genetic distance with gamma correction (C = 0.9030) for heterogeneity of mutation rates.
Population demography
Historical population dynamics of the major lineages ⁄ sublineages was examined with mismatch distribution analysis (MDA) (Rogers & Harpending 1992) implemented in ARLEQUIN 3.1. This analysis compared the observed frequencies of pairwise differences in haplotypes with those expected under a single sudden expansion model (Rogers & Harpending 1992). An expected distribution under a model of sudden demographic expansion was generated with a total of 5000 permutations. Under the null hypothesis of sudden expansion, the raggedness index quantifying the smoothness of the observed mismatch distribution (Harpending 1994) and the sum of squares deviations (SSD) between the observed and expected mismatch distributions were assessed, and statistical significance was tested by PRag and PSSD, respectively. While demographic stability produces multimodal distributions, unimodal patterns occur during sudden population expansion (Slatkin & Hudson 1991). The raggedness index was expected to have a higher value in relatively stable populations. If the sudden expansion model was not rejected, a time of expansion (t) was evaluated using the equation s = 2 ut (Rogers & Harpending 1992), where s was the mode of mismatch distribution, expressed in units of evolutionary time, and u was the mutation rate for the entire sequence under study. The value of u was calculated using the formula u = lk, where l was the mutation rate per nucleotide and k was the number of nucleotides assayed.
Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989) and Fu’s FS statistics (Fu 1997), calculated using ARLEQUIN 3.1, were used to seek evidence of demographic expansions within individual lineages and sublineages. The statistical significance was tested with 5000 permutations. The null hypothesis was that of a stable population.

Dating
In the absence of fossil or geological data, the molecular clock provides a valuable means of inferring the ages of lineage (Bromham & Penny 2003) yet such should be taken with caution. Increasing evidence suggests that the DNA of closely related species can evolve at different rates (Welch & Bromham 2005). The molecular clock is usually calibrated using the fossil record or established biogeographic events (Bromham & Penny 2003) yet such may be a source of considerable error (Arbogast et al. 2002).
The rate of divergence in ND1–ND2 was approximately constant across lineages of amphibians and reptiles (e.g. Crawford 2003; Crawford & Smith 2005). Therefore, we adopted a rate of 1.91% divergence per million years obtained by Crawford (2003) by applying a model-based correction to the ND2 data of Macey et al. (1998). To test for rate heterogeneity among lineages, we employed relative-rate tests using PHYLTEST (Kumar 1996).
Time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was estimated using the strict-clock Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method as implemented in BEAST v1.5.4 (Drummond & Rambaut 2007). Analyses were performed for 50 million generations using an HKY model of nucleotide substitution with gamma distributed rate variation among sites, assuming a Yule speciation process and a constant global molecular clock 0.957% ⁄ Myr. The effective sample size for parameter estimates and convergence was checked using TRACER (Rambaut & Drummond 2007).
Results
Authenticity of mitochondrial DNA
The fragment examined included six segments: partial ND1 and ND2, tRNAIle, one unknown sequence fragment and two copies of tRNAMet. In the ingroup samples and one outgroup taxon, N. quadranus, the unknown sequence fragment between tRNAIle and upstream tRNAMet exhibited considerable length variation. Sequences of less than about 50 bp could not be folded into secondary structure typical of tRNAGln. Thus, they were excluded from further analyses. A complete tRNAGln occurred in the other outgroup taxon, N. unculuanus, and it was typical of most metazoans.
No premature stop codons were observed in the protein-coding genes, and the tRNAs had stable secondary structures, indicating that the sequences were obtained from functional genes. Light strand sequences showed a strong bias against guanine (G = 11.3%, A = 33.5%,
T = 26.9%, and C = 28.3%), as characteristic of mtDNA. Thus, the DNA sequences were not nuclear-integrated copies of mitochondrial genes (Zhang & Hewitt 1996).
Sequence characteristics
Of the 981 bp of aligned ingroup nucleotides, 309 polymorphic sites had a transition ⁄ transversion ratio of 8.2033, and 230 sites were potentially phylogenetically informative. The gamma-shape parameter and proportion of invariable sites were estimated at 0.9030 and 0.4452, respectively. Among the 1193 specimens of N. yunnanensis and two outgroup taxa, 251 haplotypes were detected (GenBank Accession no. HM054164– HM054414. DRYAD identifier for Data file: http:// hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.1581).
Tamura-Nei-corrected sequence divergence between haplotypes ranged from 0.1% to 11.4%. Uncorrected p-divergence ranged from 0.1% to 9.38%.
Genealogy reconstruction
The lineages of N. yunnanensis exhibited strong geographical structure, and they clustered together and with robust statistical support (Fig. 2). Three major putatively independent evolutionary lineages were identified by three phylogenetically and geographically distinct haplogroups as follows: W (western), C (central) and E (eastern) (Figs 1 and 2). Lineage W, distributed in Hengduan Mountains region (populations 1– 25), contained haplotypes from tributaries of Irrawaddy, Salween, Mekong and Red rivers. Lineage C, located in the Chuxiong Basin and the southwestern Sichuan Plateau (populations 26–56), mainly contained haplotypes from most of the tributaries of Jinsha River (upper and part of the middle Yangtze River) plus a few from the Red River. Lineage E, located on the central and eastern Yunnan Plateau (populations 57–71), contained haplotypes from tributaries of the Jinsha and Pearl rivers. Co-occurring lineages occurred only in locations where different drainages conjoined historically. Lineages C and E co-occurred in Luquan, Lufeng and Wuding (populations 56, 32 and 70, respectively) on the central Yunnan Plateau (Fig. 1; Table 1). Lineages W and C were syntopic in Binchuan (17 and 37; Fig. 1; Table 1).
Lineage W contained two sublineages, W1 and W2 (Fig. 2), separated by Yongde Snow Mountain. Sublineage W1 (Fig. 1, populations 1–6) was restricted geographically to northern Yongde Snow Mountain and W1b (populations 1–4) was separated from W1a (populations 5–6) by Gaoligong Mountain. Sublineage W2 (Fig. 1, populations 7–25) from southern Yongde Snow Mountain contained sublineage W2a, comprised of populations from MengHai (population 14), Menglian (13)

and Ximeng (11), and sublineage W2b, including the remaining populations. Baoshan (Fig. 1, population 6) had haplotypes from both W1 and W2.
Lineage C was comprised of sublineage C1, containing populations 51–56, and sublineage C2, mainly consisting of populations 26–50. Sublineages C1 and C2 occurred syntopically in populations 51–56.
Sublineages E1 and E2 were syntopic only in population 69. Sublineage E1 was geographically restricted to Luquan, Wuding, Yuxi and Chengjiang (populations 56, 70, 71 and 69, respectively), most of which occurred on the central Yunnan Plateau. Sublineage E2 occurred in populations 57–69 on eastern Yunnan Plateau.
Net average genetic distances (Tamura-Nei with gamma correction) between lineages were as follows: W ⁄ C, 7.20% (±0.86%); W ⁄ E, 6.81% (±0.86%); C ⁄ E, 7.27% (±0.90%). Divergences between sublineages were

(Table1). Similarly, p ranged from 0 to 0.045260 ± 0.022109. These values were higher in Luquan (population 56), Wuding (population 70), Chengjiang (population 69), Lufeng (population 32) and Baoshan (population 6) (Table 1). Luquan had the highest p values, a reflection of the sympatric occurrence of haplotypes from four sublineages: E1, E2, C1 and C2 (Fig. 1). Lufeng and Wuding, which harboured particularly higher p values, contained haplotypes from sublineages E1 and C2 (Fig. 1). Chengjiang was the only site having haplotypes from sublineages E1 and E2 (Fig. 1). Baoshan contained haplotypes from sublineages W1 and W2.
Population genetic structure
Examination of the geographical structure with AMOVA involved five grouping options (Table 2). First, all individuals were grouped based on lineages E, W and C. Second, all sampled populations were grouped according to three current drainage basins and without regard to which lineages occurred in each zone: the eastward flowing Jinsha River basin; southward drainage basins including the Irrawaddy, Salween, Mekong and Red rivers; and the eastward flowing Pearl River drainage spanning most of the range of N. yunnanensis in the eastern Yunnan Plateau. In the third through fifth groupings, each of the three major lineages was considered independently. Within lineage W, populations were subdivided into three geographical regions recovered by the phylogeny, and lineages C and E had two geographical divisions each. Thus, some groupings considered population structure within the context of their current distributions.
AMOVA showed significant genetic structure at all hierarchical levels examined (P << 0.01; Table 2). Of the first two grouping options, the mtDNA lineages explained greater amount of variation (FCT = 0.77411). In contrast, partitioning the genetic variation by contemporary drainage basins explained much less variation (FCT = 0.37521). Analysis confined to each of the three lineages while grouping them according to geog-
raphy detected virtually identical patterns of genetic structure. The greatest portions of the overall variation (62.15%, 84.03% and 52.96%) were accounted for by among-subgroup diversity, and the within-population component (15.48%, 8.06% and 20.47%) also contributed to overall variation.
Pairwise FST estimates among populations showed the widest possible variation, ranging from 0.00 to 1.00 (Table S2). Three geographical zones and six subdivisions coincided to a great extent with three lineages and six sublineages, respectively. The highest and most significant values of FST occurred among distinct geographical zones, averaging more than 0.906 (Table 3 and Table S2). An almost identical pattern occurred among distinct subdivisions within each geographical zone (Table 3 and Table S2). Lower, though mostly significant, FST values were observed within individual geographical zones and within each subdivision. A strong, mostly significant pattern of differentiation was observed in FST estimates in subdivisions within W1 (Table 3) as suggested by the phylogeny (Fig. 2). Therefore, significant geographical structure occurred in the mtDNA of N. yunnanensis.
Population historical demography
Historical demographics for lineages W, C and E provided important insights into the history of N. yunnanensis (Fig. S2; Table 4). The lineages had substantially different MDAs and genetic diversities. Although all three lineages had multimodal distributions with steep curves and a high frequency of diverged haplotypes, the values of both PRag and PSSD were not significant, indicating that mismatch distributions did not deviate from expectations of expansion. The raggedness index for each lineage was low. Within lineages W and E, FS values were not significant. However, a significant, negative FS value ()23.2704, P = 0.0126) and lower nucleotide diversity (p = 0.0162 ± 0.0080) were observed within lineage C, strongly indicating historical demographic growth.

Discussion
The mtDNA
The tandem duplication of tRNAMet was the third discovery in an amphibian mitochondrial genome, being previously reported in Fejervarya cancrivora (Ren et al. 2009) and Fejervarya limnocharis (Liu et al. 2005). The common ancestor of the sister genera Fejervarya and Nanorana (Chen et al. 2005; Che et al. 2009) may have had the tandem duplication. Both N. yunnanensis and N. quadranus have the apomorphic, short sequence. The reduced sequence can serve to unite N. yunnanensis and N. quadranus as sister taxa. This is an alternative set of relationships for N. yunnanensis, N. quadranus and N. unculuanus from those resolved by Che et al. (2009), where N. unculuanus and N. yunnanensis were weakly resolved as being sister taxa.
Population genetic diversity
Compared with other amphibians (e.g. 0.00967 ± 0.000001, Crinia georgiana, Edwards et al. 2007), higher levels of diversity (0.056854 ± 0.027182) were found within N. yunnanensis, which might be attributed to a long evolutionary history, a broad distribution and a geologically complex history. A long evolutionary history may account for high level of diversity in ND1– ND2. Their most recent common ancestor appeared about 5.25 Mya. The long evolutionary history allowed

 Population expansion was indicated within sublineages W2, C2, C1 and E2 (Fig. S2; Table 4). Smoother MDA curves fit well with the expected unimodal model of sudden expansion and, statistically, population growth was strongly supported by both SSD and raggedness index. Significant population growth was also inferred by FS and lower nucleotide diversity. Estimates of expansion time ranged from approximately 160 000– 620 000 years before present (BP), mostly from 490 000 to 620 000 years BP. In contrast, neither MDA nor neutrality tests supported population expansion for sublineages W1 and E1.
Tajima’s D values were not significant. However, they were negative and P-values were lower in lineages in which MDA and Fu’s FS test indicated population expansion.

the species to accumulate mutations. Notwithstanding, N. yunnanensis is broadly distributed and geologically this region experienced a complex evolution. The most significant geological changes in the Yunnan Plateau occurred from the Pliocene to the Early Pleistocene (Cheng et al. 2001), when a third uplifting on QinghaiTibet Plateau occurred more strongly and frequently, starting about 3.4 Mya (Yu et al. 2000). The drainage system experienced a complicated evolution involving erosion and river capture (e.g. Cheng et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004) that must have lead to repeated isolation and fragmentation events in N. yunnanensis. The process of diversification is somewhat similar to that hypothesized for plants on the QTP and its adjacent areas, and for freshwater fishes outside of Yunnan province. The great species diversity and higher population differentiation in the areas likely originated partially through repeated shifts of species’ ranges and their genetic isolation in diverse habitats (Wu 1980; Axelrod et al. 1996).
Genetic structure and drainage history
Studies indicate strong associations between the evolution of palaeodrainage systems and current genetic patterns in drainage-associated organisms (Perdices et al. 2005; Kozak et al. 2006; Zemlak et al. 2008). Geomorphological evidence suggests that paleodrainage and contemporary hydrological systems differed significantly in Yunnan province (Clark et al. 2004) (Fig. S1). The distribution of N. yunnanensis is largely confined to drainage systems. Consequently, its genetic structure might correspond to the region’s paleogeography. To evaluate this possibility, we formed an H0 stating that contemporary gene flow was unrestricted within contemporary lineages. This H0 would be rejected by finding that overall variation was attributable to historical among-lineage associations. The AMOVA analysis (Table 2) showed that the greatest amount of overall genetic variation occurred when group partitioning was based on genealogy alone. When grouping was based on the current drainage system, the level of differentiation among populations within a single drainage was almost twice as large as among different drainages (51.42% and 37.52%, respectively; Table 2). Thus, we could not reject the H0. This pattern indicated that contemporary drainage basins are composites of historically isolated drainage systems.
Lineages W and C clustered together with strong support (Fig. 2), which supported the hypothesis that the modern upper and middle Yangtze River drainage and most of drainages distributed in Hengduan Mountains Region were originally major tributaries to the paleoRed River system (Clark et al. 2004). The estimated
divergence times between lineage W and C (􏰁4.78 Mya) approximately corresponded to an early Pliocene transition from being exterior to interior in the drainage system in central Yunnan (Cheng et al. 2001) and the differential uplift of the Ailao Shan-Diancang Shan Range (Wang et al. 2006).
Within the middle Yangtze River basin, a distinctive mtDNA discordance was observed between haplotypes from some tributaries (including populations 57–59, 61, 63, 65–67 and 70, belonging to lineage E; Figs 1 and 2) and those from others (populations 33–56, lineage C). This discovery supported the hypothesis that the modern middle Yangtze River drainage was formed by connection of historically independent palaeodrainage basins. A freshwater fish phylogeographic study is concordant with this hypothesis (Yang et al. 2009). Most tributaries of the middle Yangtze River historically flowed southward into the South China Sea through the Paleo-Red River before their capture and reversal (Clark et al. 2004). The estimated diversification times among the lineages of N. yunnanensis (􏰁5.25 Mya) approximately corresponded to an Early Pliocene watershed formation of the central Yunnan Plateau (Cheng et al. 2001). This was a deformation response to the extrusion and uplift of the Central Yunnan block in the early Pliocene (Zhang et al. 2003), and it divided the ancient Red, Pearl and Jinsha Rivers (Wang & Wang 2005).
The relatively low levels of genetic divergence (1.0%) between lineages C2a and C2b demonstrate the important roles that historical drainage patterns play in shaping the modern genetic structure of N. yunnanensis. Lineage C2a (mostly from populations 26–31), composed of haplotypes from tributaries of Red River basin, largely corresponds to historical drainages (Clark et al. 2004). Lineage C2b (mostly from populations 32–56) primarily includes haplotypes from tributaries of the Jinsha River basin. These two lineages are associated with different drainage basins yet they are sister groups with shallower divergence than those among C2a and C1 (2.6%), C2b and C1 (2.2%); here the BPP is moderate (0.90; Fig. 2). This pattern supports the hypothesis that the tributaries of the Jinsha River basin historically flowed southward and connected with the paleo-Red River basin (Clark et al. 2004).
Cladogenesis within lineage W is also congruent with the history of drainage patterns. Lineage W1b contains haplotypes from tributaries of the Irrawaddy River basin, W1a from those of Salween River basin and W2 from both the Mekong River and Red river basins (Fig. 1). These drainage basins in western Yunnan have experienced little change since the early Pliocene (Cheng et al. 2001) with the exception of their upper portions in southeastern Tibet (Clark et al. 2004). The AMOVA analysis supports their antiquity. The greatest

amount of genetic variation occurs among groups (62.15%, Table 2) when the data are partitioned as contemporary drainage basins.
Two geographical subdivisions of lineage E explain the greatest amount of variation (84.03%, Table 2). Sublineage E2 is distributed across the eastern Yunnan Plateau, and E1 is on the central Yunnan Plateau at Luquan, Wuding, Lufeng and Yuxi (Figs 1 and 2). These lineages have an average divergence of 5.43%. Sublineage E1 is strongly correlated with the Late Pliocene–Early Pleistocene catchment basin and its many lakes, both large and small (Wang et al. 1995).
Sublineages C1 and C2 likely originated through allopatric fragmentation of ancient populations during the early Pleistocene when the southward flowing Dadu ⁄ Anning River was captured. One part became the eastward flowing lower Dadu River (Clark et al. 2004). New, steep gradients in the uppermost Anning River were formed with the uplift of adjacent Gonga Shan (Clark et al. 2004).
In some cases, the genealogical history of N. yunnanensis substantially corresponds with historical, rather than contemporary drainage patterns. Thus, acceptance of our H0 varies among the clades. Recent biogeographic studies of Southeast Asian fishes also demonstrate that the evolution of drainage basins played a key role in shaping current geographic patterns of genetic and species diversity (e.g. Ru ̈ber et al. 2004).
Many of the vicariance patterns recovered herein are novel. Vicariance theory assumes that common distributional patterns originated via shared vicariance events. Thus, further study involving a diversity of species endemic to adjacent areas of the QTP is required to test the ubiquity of our vicariance hypotheses.
Restricted gene flow among populations of N. yunnanensis is strongly implied (Table S2). Long-term genetic isolation among lineages is corroborated by FST values >0.94 (Table 2). Low dispersal ability and this species preference for sitting on moss-covered rocks near cold montane streams at higher elevations may be responsible for the restricted gene flow. This type of habitat is never continuous.
Population expansion and secondary contact during the Pleistocene
Sympatric maternal lineages occur in a few populations. This pattern could result from either incomplete lineage sorting, or secondary contact between previously allopatric lineages (Barber 1999). Lineages W and C cooccur in Binchuan (populations 17, 37; Fig. 1). The higher nucleotide diversity (0.031086 ± 0.015631), geography and the absence of intermediate divergent haplotypes strongly indicate secondary contact. Secondary
contact is also indicated in Luquan, Lufeng and Wuding, where lineages C and E co-occur.
If secondary contact occurred, then population expansion is expected. Thus, the H0 states that populations are stable in their occurrence, and the H1 is one of the range expansions. MDA and some neutrality tests (Fig. S2; Table 4) reject the H0 and suggest population expansion in sublineages W2, C1, C2 and E2. Secondary contact among lineages is also strongly supported by the higher average nucleotide diversity within these populations (Table 1). Secondary admixture of previously allopatric populations likely produced substantial levels of sympatric genetic diversity (e.g. Fu et al. 2005). Presumably, gene flow is unabated in these areas, but this remains to be documented. Secondary contact between lineages occurs in areas adjacent to major drainage divides (Fig. 1), and this strongly indicates that drainage basins profoundly influenced contemporary genetic structure. For example, sympatry occurs between lineages C and E along the central Yunnan Plateau, which is divided by the Jinsha, Red and Pear rivers (Wang & Wang 2005).
Although MDA analyses suggest demographic expansion, neutrality tests reveal no demographic growth, except in lineage C (Table 4). This incongruence could be attributed to the occurrence of strong subdivisions within each lineage (Rogers & Harpending 1992). Lineage C has two subgroups, but the extent of differentiation between them is far lower than that within lineages W and E (Table 3). MDA is robust and hardly affected by population structure (Harpending 1994) and should approximately hold true even when populations are completely isolated (Rogers 1995), yet population subdivision lowers the power of neutrality tests (Ray et al. 2003).
The estimated expansion time suggests extensive demographic growth from the onset of the Middle Pleistocene (about 0.6 Mya) triggered by climatic oscillations. Indeed, 0.8 Mya marks an important climate transition period (Jiang et al. 2002; Ming 2007). Higher levels of haplotype diversity and lower levels of nucleotide diversity occur in sublineages undergoing historical demographic expansion as opposed to sublineages exhibiting demographic stability (Table 4). Populations likely rapidly colonized or recolonized some areas during climatic oscillations. This latter possibility would reduce allelic diversity within lineages (Hewitt 2000).
Implications for conservation
The total genetic diversity is a key to evaluating the persistence and conservation of a species (Rauch & BarYam 2005). The maintenance of genetic diversity is

required for long-term survival of species (Frankel & Soule ́ 1981) and for the long-term persistence of ecosystem functions (Frankham et al. 2002; Frankham 2005). The loss of variation may largely limit the adaptability of populations to changing environments (Lacy 1997).
Two morphologically very similar species, Nanorana liui (=Rana muta, Su & Li 1986) and Nanorana (Paa) bourreti (Dubois 1987) (as Rana bourreti), have been described from this region. Che et al. (2009) discovered that N. yunnanensis (then Paa yunnanensis) was not monophyletic with respect to N. liui and N. bourreti. They considered the latter two species to be junior synonyms of N. yunnanensis. However, Huang et al. (2009) reported that the population from Jingdong was a new record of N. bourreti rather than N. yunnanensis, based on both molecular and morphological evidence. Huang et al. (2009) provide evidence that N. yunnanensis may be a species complex, and this is important because bad taxonomy kills (Daugherty et al. 1990; May 1990). Our study reveals pronounced mtDNA intraspecific genetic divergence. The mean among-lineage divergence (7.09%) is higher than intraspecific divergences reported for many other species of anurans (e.g. 1.42%, Edwards et al. 2007; 1.5%, Kozak et al. 2006; 3%, Hoffman & Blouin 2004), suggesting that N. yunnanensis may be a species complex. Widespread, high-density species are less likely to succumb to extinction than small isolated species (Macarthur & Wilson 1963, 1967). Cryptic species can be lost or further endangered through bad taxonomy, and at the expense of conserving more widespread taxa. If the recognition of N. bourreti (lineage W) is correct, then our genealogy implies that at least three (W, C and E) and as many as five species (W1, W2, C, E1 and E2) occur in the complex, each having a far-morerestricted geographic distribution. However, the sympatric occurrences of several lineages also suggest that recognition of N. bourreti might not be justified. Nuclear gene data and ⁄ or morphometric examination is required to test the possibility of a species complex. Such would imply that the occurrence of sympatric lineages owes to the introgressive capture of mitochondrial genomes via interspecific hybridization.
Nanorana yunnanensis is listed as a vulnerable species by Zhao (1998). Over past few decades, the species has suffered rapid population declines mainly owing to over-harvesting for human consumption, but also because of habitat destruction associated with agricultural expansion, deforestation, community development and water pollution. Conservation requires a reduction in human disturbance, possibly through establishing several protected areas encompassing all of the lineages.
Two major Chinese government policies promote conservation in southwestern China. Nowadays, logging is
completely banned within most of China’s biodiversity hotspots, a response to the catastrophic floods of 1998. In addition, the Land Conversion Program (= the Grain to Green Policy) facilitates conservation by banning agriculture on steep slopes, prohibiting the clearing of forests for shifting agriculture, and enacting laws for protecting species. Farmers can receive subsidies for replanting barren slopes, albeit initially with cultures of pine and fruit trees. Diverse, native vegetation would promote biodiversity throughout the region (Biodiversity-hotspots 2005).

Fig. S1 Reconstruction of drainage basin history owing to river capture⁄reversals of major rivers in eastern Tibet (from Clark et al. 2004). Colours represent individual drainage basins drawn on top of grayscale topography. (a) Interpreted pattern prior to the major captures, where the upper Yangtze, middle Yangtze, upper Mekong, upper Salween and the Tsangpo rivers drained together to the South China Sea through the paleo-Red River (blue). (b) Capture⁄reversal of the middle Yangtze River redi-
rects drainage away from Red River and into the East China Sea through the lower Yangtze River (green). (c) Capture of the upper Yangtze River to the east into the lower Yangtze River, and the upper Mekong and upper Salween rivers obtain their modern drainage positions (green, yellow and orange, respectively). Capture of the Tsangpo River to the south through the Irrawaddy River (red). (d) Capture of the Tsangpo River through the Brahmaputra River into its modern course (pink). This final configuration is the modern drainage basin pattern.
