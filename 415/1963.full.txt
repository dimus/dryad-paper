ABSTRACT
As a first step toward population and quantitative genetic analysis of neurotransmitter receptors in
Drosophila melanogaster, we describe the parameters of nucleotide variation in three serotonin receptors and their association with pupal heart rate. Thirteen kilobases of DNA including the complete coding regions of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2 were sequenced in 216 highly inbred lines extracted from two North American populations in California and North Carolina. Nucleotide and amino acid polymorphism is in the normal range for Drosophila genes and proteins, and linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly such that haplotype blocks are typically only a few SNPs long. However, intron 1 of 5-HT1A consists of two haplotypes that are at significantly different frequencies in the two populations. Neither this region of the gene nor any of the common amino acid polymorphisms in the three loci associate with either heart rate or heart rate variability. A cluster of SNPs in intron 2 of 5-HT1A, including a triallelic site, do show a highly significant interaction between genotype, sex, and population. While it is likely that a combination of weak, complex selection pressures and population structure has helped shape variation in the serotonin receptors of Drosophila, much larger sampling strategies than are currently adopted in evolutionary genetics will be required to disentangle these effects.
MOLECULAR dissection of the genetic basis of complex multifactorial traits, such as cardiovascular physiology and behavior, presents numerous challenges (Glazier et al. 2002; Berry et al. 2003; Merikangas and Risch 2003). These include finding the genes that are responsible for small quantitative effects (Mackay 2001), establishing how particular alleles are distributed within and among populations (e.g., Rockman et al. 2003), and working out the architecture of genotypic and environmental interactions. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping has emerged as the most powerful approach to localizing genetic factors of small effect (Risch and Merikangas 1996; Jorde 2000), and in humans genomewide association scans using thousands of SNP markers have been effective in localizing genetic effects to 􏱔1 cM (Cardon and Bell 2001). Such analysis depends on high levels of haplotype structure, while more fine-structure dissection requires comprehensive sampling of nucleotide variation in the region of interest (Johnson et al. 2001; Zondervan and Cardon 2004). The ability to identify specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes that contribute to phenotypic variation is also an essential component of efforts to understand the evolutionary forces that shape genomes.
In an organism like Drosophila that exhibits high levels

of polymorphism with very little linkage disequilibrium, association studies must focus on candidate genes. To date, most progress in associating genotypic with phenotypic variation in Drosophila has been in relation to bristle number (Mackay 1995, 2001). Chromosome substitution into a common genetic background has been used to increase the relative contribution of single chromosomes, facilitating demonstration that several candidate loci with roles in neurogenesis appear to contribute to variation for abdominal and sternopleural bristle number (Lai et al. 1994; Long et al. 1998, 2000; Lyman et al. 1999; Robin et al. 2002). Most of these studies involved genotyping of just a subset of the most common SNPs and so approximated linkage disequilibrium mapping, but since haplotype blocks are only a few nucleotides long, every third or fourth SNP provides an independent test of association. Consequently, resolution may be to the level of individual quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN), but for a locus 10 kb long, several hundred tests of association need to be made for full coverage, and the gain in resolution is offset somewhat by reduced power due to multiple comparison issues (Long and Langley 1999). Most recently, complete sequencing has been used to identify QTN in Dopa decarboxylase for longevity (De Luca et al. 2003) and in Egfr for wing shape (Palsson and Gibson 2004) and cryptic variation for photoreceptor determination (Dworkin et al. 2003). Each of these studies discuss subtle nuances in experimental design and interpretation, and while they sug-

gest that sample sizes of a few hundred near isogenic lines are sufficient to detect QTN that account for several percent of the variation for a trait, much remains to be learned concerning the most appropriate experimental designs and sampling strategies.
Two central issues relate to the ability to replicate the associations in outbred populations (Dworkin et al. 2003, and in preparation; Genissel et al. 2004), and the effect of population stratification on test statistics (Pritchard et al. 2000; Thornsberry et al. 2001; Palsson and Gibson 2004). Although Drosophila melanogaster is often regarded as panmictic, there is increasing evidence for morphological and genetic differentiation between populations (Begun and Aquadro 1993; Andolfatto and Wall 2003; Caracristi and Schlo ̈tterer 2003; Glinka et al. 2003; Palsson and Gibson 2004). One of the objectives of the current study was to assess the effect of differences in SNP allele frequency between two populations from North Carolina and California on association mapping in Drosophila. By sampling of the order of 100 alleles from each population, we also have the opportunity to evaluate simultaneously population and quantitative genetic approaches to inference of potential functional differentiation of alleles.
Considerable attention has been given to the relationship between variation in the serotonin and dopamine axes and psychological variation in humans (Berry et al. 2003). Serotonin is a biogenic amine, which serves a neurotransmitter function in synaptic transmission in animal phyla (Hay-Schmidt 2000). It also plays an important role in the regulation of locomotion (Segalat et al. 1995; Lucki 1998) and affects physiological functions such as heart rate (Johnson et al. 1997; Zornik et al. 1999) and other targets of the sympathetic nervous system in mammals as well as in Drosophila (Monastirioti 1999; Blenau and Baumann 2001). Both serotonin receptors and transporters have been subject to extensive association studies in humans. Particular attention has focused on a handful of marker SNPs, notably T102C in 5-HT2A and G861C in 5-HT1B (Arranz et al. 1995; Williams et al. 1996; Lappalainen et al. 1998), although more extensive sequence surveys are beginning to reveal that these sites are in strong linkage disequilibrium with other sites, including promoter polymorphisms that affect transcription (Sanders et al. 2001; Duan et al. 2003). With this in mind, and recognizing the conserved function of serotonin in neurotransmission in vertebrates and invertebrates, we have undertaken a reverse quantitative genetic study in flies exploring the function of polymorphism in three D. melanogaster serotonin receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2) and the candidate traits of pupal heart rate and physiological response to drug ingestion (N. Nikoh, R. Carrillo and G. Gibson, unpublished results).
The dorsal vessel of Drosophila is homologous to the vertebrate heart and pumps hemolymph rhythmically (Rizki 1978; Bodmer and Venkatesh 1998; Curtis et
al. 1999). Aspects of both developmental specification and physiological function are highly conserved between mammals and invertebrates (Cripps and Olson 2002). Transfusion of neurotransmitters and neural peptides into pupae, larvae, or embryos has shown that regulation of the heart-beat length varies according to developmental stage and that serotonin is a major cardiac modulator (Johnson et al. 1997; Zornik et al. 1999). Genetic approaches have also been applied to dissect Drosophila heart rate and have revealed considerable genetic variation for heart rate in prepupae (Robbins et al. 1999). A genome-wide deficiency screen implicated the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B loci as modulators of prepupal heart rate, since hemizygosity for this region of the genome reduced beat length (Ashton et al. 2001). Here we report the sequence of a total of 13 kb of the three serotonin receptors in 200 nearly isogenic lines from two natural populations and test for association with measures of prepupal heart rate and heart rate variability. Rather than focusing on a single major-effect SNP, the data reported here suggest that multiple SNPs throughout the locus may have phenotypic consequences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fly stocks: D. melanogaster isofemales were collected in July 2000 from West End, North Carolina, and used to establish 130 nearly isogenic lines by between 15 and 20 generations of sib pair-mating (Palsson and Gibson 2004). A total of 85 nearly isogenic lines from a California population were kindly provided by S. Nuzhdin. These lines were collected in 1998 from Wolfskill, California and inbred by nearly 50 generations of sib pair mating (Yang and Nuzhdin 2003). While in the lab, all lines were maintained in vials containing standard cornmeal media with a few granules of live yeast and were kept in an incubator at 25􏱟 on a 12-hr light:dark cycle.
Sequencing: Fly DNA was extracted from a single male of each near-isogenic line. The fly was homogenized in 50 􏱗l squishing buffer (10 mm Tris pH 8.2; 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 200 mg/ml proteinase K), incubated at 37􏱟 for 30 min and then at 95􏱟 for 2 min, and chilled for storage at 􏱛20􏱟. Amplification of specific fragments was performed by 35 cycles ofPCR,each30secat94􏱟,30secat50􏱟,and3minat72􏱟,in 1.5 mm MgCl2. Amplified fragments were extracted from 0.8% agarose gels using QIAquick columns according to manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA), and directly sequenced using Big Dye II dye-terminator sequencing (PE Biosystems, Boston) on an ABI 3700 with average read lengths in the range of 700–750 nucleotides. All oligonucleotide primers for PCR and sequencing are listed in supplementary Table 1 at http:/www.genetics.org/supplemental/. Sequence data from North Carolina were checked and aligned with Contig Express in Vector NTI (InforMax, Frederick, MD). Chromatograms of sequence data were checked for polymorphic sites and manually edited where necessary. Sequence data from California were aligned using Phred (Ewing et al. 1998), Phrap (http:/ www.phrap.org), and BioLign (http:/www.maizegenetics.net) programs. All polymorphic sites lower than phred score 20 were confirmed by eye. Singleton substitutions were confirmed by resequencing, and regions of heterozygosity were omitted from the analysis. GenBank accession numbers for all of the sequences are AY564239–AY564734 and AY564785–AY566107.

Sequence analysis: Sequence alignment was performed manually using GeneDoc (Nicholas et al. 1997). For association tests, FST, LD, and sliding-window analyses, only biallelic sites with common polymorphisms (defined as the more rare allele frequency 􏱕5%) were used. Sites that contain indel substitution were also omitted from our analysis because of complex mutational patterns. Parameters of population genetic structure were computed using an analysis of variance framework (Weir and Cockerham 1984; Excoffier et al. 1992; Weir 1996). Fixation indices for each polymorphic site were separately calculated using Arlequin (Schneider et al. 2000), and significance was assessed using either 1000 or 100,000 permutations. Linkage disequilibrium between pairs of biallelic sites was calculated with TASSEL (http:/www. maizegenetics.net) or our own code, and significance was estimated by Fisher’s exact test with the standard Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. Sliding-window analysis of the number of haplotypes was conducted on the common polymorphic sites, with a window length of 300 bp and a step size of 20 bp. Energy minimization was used to predict the secondary structures of the two 5-HT1A intron 1 RNAs, using the Vienna RNA secondary structure server (Hofacker 2003).
Phenotyping heart rate and heart rate variability: Heart rates of 129 isogenic lines from North Carolina and 85 isogenic lines from California were assayed as described (Robbins et al. 1999; Ashton et al. 2001) by digital electronic capture of the fluctuation in transmitted light intensity due to movement of the dorsal vessel of a white prepupa placed on a microscope stage. The fluctuation in light intensity was recorded for 1–3 min. The flies were maintained in an incubator at 25􏱟 and were assayed at this temperature (􏳍2􏱟) between 2:00 and 4:00 pm. Pupal heart rates were calculated as the inverse of the mean length of 20 consecutive beats, averaged over three sets of nonoverlapping beats. The index of heart rate variability was calculated as the coefficient of variation for 10 sets of the inverse of the mean length of 5 consecutive beats. To normalize the distribution of the coefficient of variation, we added 1 to the coefficient of variation for each individual and took the base 10 logarithm. The sex of 90% of the prepupae was determined after eclosion of the adult in a microcentrifuge tube. In general, 20 prepupae per North Carolina line and 10 per California line were scored, although a few lines with very low fecundity were represented by fewer individuals. These did not show a trend toward extreme heart rates.
Statistical analysis: The significance of differences in trait values between sexes and between populations was performed using PROC TTEST or PROC NPAR1WAY in SAS Version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Quantitative genetic parameters were assessed using JMP Version 5 (SAS Institute) or PROC MIXED in SAS. Lines were assumed to be nearly isogenic for the estimation of heritability (Falconer and Mackay 1996).
Figure 1.—Genomic structure of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2. The extent of the sequenced region in each of the three genes is shown as a solid bar underneath the gene structures. Exons are depicted by squares (solid coding regions) and flanking regions and introns as thin lines. Arrows indicate sequence reads in each contig. In this figure, the centromere is to the left of 5-HT1B, which is transcribed from right to left, divergently from 5-HT1A. The two genes are separated by 60 kb and several genes. An alternative promoter for 5-HT1A 20 kb upstream of the indicated promoter (not shown) appeared in the Version 3 release of the Drosophila genome annotation.
Line means for the two heart-beat traits were estimated by analysis of variance using PROC MIXED in SAS based on measurements of each individual fly. This ensured that among-fly variability was the source of residual error. Two-way factorial analyses of variance of heart rate and heart rate variability were conducted with sex as a fixed effect and line as a random effect. Genetic correlations between the traits were computed following Robertson (1959) as the difference between the line and trait mean squares divided by the sum of the line and trait mean square minus twice the error mean square. Similarly, the genetic correlations between the sexes were computed with mean squares from analysis of variance with sex substituting for trait.
Associations between common polymorphic sites in serotonin receptors and heart rate phenotypes were assessed using PROC MIXED with mixed models of the form:
Heart beat trait 􏱖 􏱗 􏱘 G 􏱘 S 􏱘 P 􏱘 G 􏱙 S 􏱘 G 􏱙 P 􏱘 S 􏱙 P 􏱘 G 􏱙 S 􏱙 P 􏱘 L 􏱘 ε,
where SNP genotype (G ), sex (S ), and population (P ) denote fixed effects, and line (L) denotes the random effect of line. In this case, heart-beat traits were the least square mean for each sex and line within a population. Fitting line as a random effect controls for pseudoreplication between the sexes, which are highly correlated. Omission of this term greatly inflates P-values, as confirmed by permutation tests keeping sexes within lines and lines within sexes constant (see supplementary Table 3 at http:/www.genetics.org/supplemental/). Only common polymorphic sites were tested, since rare alleles do not provide a large enough sample size to detect effects.
RESULTS
Sequence variation in the serotonin receptors of D. melanogaster: We sequenced 13 kb of three of the four known serotonin receptors from 216 highly inbred lines. Two of the genes, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B, are located within 60 kb of one another at 56B1-56B5 on chromosome 2R, while the third, 5-HT2, is located near the centromere of chromosome 3 at 82C5. On the basis of a preliminary survey of variation in cDNA clones from a dozen lines (W. Jin and G. Gibson, unpublished data), we focused on the regions diagrammed in Figure 1, excluding monomorphic exons and the 3􏰂 UTR (exon 10) of 5-HT1A. No attempt was made to include all of the regulatory regions associated with each gene, which

in any case have not yet been defined experimentally. In total, 6.5 of the 30 kb of 5-HT1A was covered in four contiguous fragments, 3.5 of the 6 kb of 5-HT1B in three contigs, and 3.0 of the 20 kb of 5-HT2 in three contigs.
Heterozygosity was three times greater in the 5-HT2 than in the 5-HT1 region (􏱜31 vs. 11%) and 50% greater in the North Carolina than in the California lines. Both results probably relate to the effect of linked deleterious sites on the rate of fixation due to inbreeding (Caballero and Keightley 1998): the California lines were sib mated for three times as many generations as were the North Carolina ones, and beacause the 5-HT2 gene is proximal to the centromere, recombination is reduced relative to 5-HT1. Final sequence coverage was 90 and 97% for 82 California and 121 North Carolina 5-HT1 chromosomes, respectively, and between 85 and 90% for 83 California and 95 North Carolina 5-HT2 chromosomes. Due to the expense of obtaining in excess of 2 Mb of sequence, no attempt was made to sequence each allele in both directions, so estimates of sequence diversity must be considered with this caveat in mind.
However, as for our similar study of Egfr (Palsson and Gibson 2004), 􏱕10% sequence overlap was obtained from different reads, from which the error rate in detection of polymorphic sites can be estimated as 􏱔0.1%.
Parameters of nucleotide variation are summarized in Table 1. In total, 463 SNPs and 51 indels were detected in 􏱔10 kb of the 5-HT1 region, corresponding to a polymorphism every 20 bp. Correspondingly, several sites segregate three or even four nucleotides, and most alleles represent novel haplotypes across the full extent of the locus. Sliding-window analysis of nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype number in Figure 2 demonstrates a tendency toward reduced nucleotide diversity in exons. A full breakdown by exon is available online in supplemental Table 2 at http:/www.genetics. org/supplemental/. The ratio of synonymous to replacement substitutions was 78 to 48, and while only 12 of the replacements are in 5-HT1B, comparison with the D. simulans allele by the HKA test (Hudson et al. 1987) did not indicate evidence for positive selection in the region. However, Figure 3 clearly shows the constraining effect of purifying selection on the serotonin

The number of polymorphic nucleotide sites and the number of haplotypes in a sliding window of 300 bp, at 20-bp intervals, are plotted along the sequenced region.

receptors, as amino acid polymorphism in D. melanogaster is largely excluded from the transmembrane domains and the carboxy-terminal tail. As expected for a centromere-proximal locus, sequence diversity was much reduced in 5-HT2, and all subsequent analyses focus on the 5-HT1 region.
Population structure and linkage disequilibrium in the 5-HT1 region: Two types of data point to significant population structure between the two North American samples. Both populations harbor a large number of rare private alleles. The difference in sign of Tajima’s D for each locus separately suggests a slight excess of singletons and doubletons in the North Carolina population, although this is not significant. The more compelling observation is that there is a stretch of 500 bp in intron 1 of 5-HT1A that shows highly significant divergence in allele frequency between North Carolina and California. This region stands out in Figure 4, a slidingwindow plot of FST computed by AMOVA (Excoffier et al. 1992), with a peak value of 0.2, which is significant at P 􏱔 0.0003. Interestingly, haplotype diversity is relatively low in this intron (Figure 2, arrow), consistent with recent selection driving differentiation between the two populations. Throughout the remainder of the loci,
Figure 3.—Constraint on the location of amino acid polymorphisms. The location of singleton (open), rare (shaded), and common (solid) amino acid variants is shown relative to their location on the seven-transmembrane structure of the serotonin receptors for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B. Nucleotide and indel polymorphisms are shown as circles and squares, respectively. Note that polymorphism is concentrated in the extracellular N-terminal domain and intracellular loop, but that a few polymorphisms are detected in the membrane-spanning regions. Sequences that were not sequenced are shown as dotted lines.
allele frequencies of common SNPs are very similar, and FST is not significantly greater than zero.
Plots of the significance of linkage disequilibrium in Figure 5 demonstrate that haplotype structure is very similar between the two populations (NC on the left, CA on the right). Typically only sites within 200 bp of one another show strong LD, as observed for other loci in regions of normal recombination (Schaeffer and Miller 1993; Langley et al. 2000; Aquadro et al. 2001; Palsson and Gibson 2004). However, a large 1.5-kb block of LD centered on intron 1 and including most of exon 2 stands out in both populations and actually extends to two noncontiguous regions in intron 2 and exon 3. Decay of LD is thus not monotonic as generally expected, and fairly sharp breaks between haplotype blocks may suggest unequal distribution of recombination and/or gene conversion breakpoints within the locus. The higher significance of LD in North Carolina can be attributed to the larger sample size. There is some suggestion of long-range LD between regions of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B, particularly involving a second LD block including exons 8 and 9 of 5-HT1A, but it is unclear whether this is significant after correction for multiple comparisons.
Figure 4.—Population differentiation in intron 1 of 5-HT1A. Fixation indices (FST) estimated by AMOVA between North Carolina and California populations are plotted according to position in the 5-HT1B–5-HT1A gene region. Open boxes on the line at the bottom of the figure represent exons. Note that the position along the gene has been made artificially contiguous in the plot by telescoping each block of sequence (represented as solid bars above the gene structure diagram) as indicated. A solid bar above the plot highlights the region, corresponding to intron 1 of 5HT1A, in which FST departs significantly from the empirical null model (testwise P 􏱔 0.0003; experimentwise P 􏱔 0.05 after Bonferroni correction).

 Since intron 1 of 5-HT1A stands out as unusual in both the population structure and LD analyses, we examined the structure of the region by phylogenetic network analysis (Figure 6). Intron 1 ranges in length from 202 to 230 bases and includes six common SNPs and one indel that define two major haplotypes observed in 97% of the alleles. Only six recombinant alleles defining three novel haplotypes were observed in the sample of 192 alleles. The high FST is due to the low frequency of one of the haplotypes (0.21) in California, whereas it is equally prevalent in North Carolina (0.49). Since a D. simulans allele shows elements of both haplotypes, it is not possible to polarize the direction of selection in the region in the two populations. Prediction of the free energy of duplex formation suggests that the two haplotypes are likely to fold into remarkably different

secondary structures (Figure 6B), which could influence splicing efficiency.
Association between heart rate and nucleotide variation: Cardiograms were recorded from 3427 white prepupae by digital capture of the fluctuation in light intensity with each beat. Heart rate was estimated in beats per second from 60 beats by averaging the time required for three sets of 20 contiguous beats, as described in materials and methods. Since the Drosophila dorsal vessel periodically skips beats or even stops for several seconds, it is rarely possible to measure 60 consecutive beats. Although there is variation in the number and severity of these stoppages, it is difficult to quantify, so we chose a more robust measure of arrhythmia, namely heart rate variability, the logarithm of the coefficient of variation of the heart rate in five sets of 10 beats. Both

 B, plot the negative logarithm of the P-value for heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), respectively, for each of the 159 common variants along the locus from centromere to telomere (namely from the 3􏰂 end of 5-HT1B to the 3􏰂 end of 5-HT1A, since the genes are transcribed divergently). Allowing for strong linkage disequilibrium between adjacent sites, five SNPs show nominal association at P 􏱔 0.05 for HR and seven for HRV. These numbers are expected by chance. Bonferroni correction for the multiple comparisons and both traits requires a significance threshold of 0.000157 (0.05/318), but none of the sites approach this value. The cluster of SNPs adjacent to exon 3 that have the strongest evidence for association with HRV also associate weakly with HR, a result that is not expected by chance, but the permutation test significance for the summed likelihood of two-trait associations, given the genetic correlation between the traits, is only suggestively significant (P 􏱖 0.006), given the number of comparisons.
To account for the fixed effects of sex and population differences, we fit a mixed model with line as a random effect including each of the interaction terms among genotype, sex, and population (Dworkin et al. 2003; Palsson and Gibson 2004). Neither of the two-way interactions involving genotype resulted in any P-values 􏱔0.01, but Figure 8C shows a cluster of sites in intron 2 of 5-HT1A that show highly significant association as a function of both sex and population. One of these sites (G221856A in AE003797) plotted in Figure 8D exceeds the Bonferroni threshold, formally suggesting that the G allele has opposite effects on heart rate in females in North Carolina and California, whereas it is the A allele that differentiates the populations in males. Such a complex interaction implies sex-dependent epistatic interaction between the SNP and an unknown site or sites that

are at a different frequency in the two populations, but might also simply be a false-positive result. Intriguingly, several other linked sites in intron 2 and exon 3 of 5-HT1A have three common segregating variants, one of which also show signs of a three-way interaction and has allele frequencies of 0.66, 0.20, and 0.14 (site 221719). This is a very uncommon situation and is at least consistent with the idea that weak but complex selection operates on this region of the gene.
It is also notable, however, that no evidence for association with either heart rate trait was observed either with the sites in intron 1 that show population stratification or with any of the common amino acid polymorphisms, as documented in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
This investigation of association between nucleotide polymorphisms and cardiophysiological variation is part of a larger effort to evaluate the potential for mapping quantitative genetic variation to the nucleotide level in Drosophila. Although successful linkage disequilibrium mapping has been reported for bristle number (Long et al. 1998 and 2000), insecticide resistance (Daborn et al. 2002), and immunity (Lazzaro et al. 2004), replication of association in natural populations is not straightforward (Genissel et al. 2004), and it seems that complete sequencing may be necessary to identify the actual site(s) that cause phenotypic differences (Dworkin et al. 2003). An emerging feature of these studies is that extra insight may be gained through the combination of population and quantitative genetic inferences from a single experiment (Palsson et al. 2004; Palsson and Gibson 2004), so it is interersting to note that these two types of signature in this study point to different gene

regions of the 5-HT1A gene. In particular, two pieces of evidence relate to the recent operation of natural selection on the loci, and two different aspects of the data are suggestive of genotype-phenotype association.
Selection on the serotonin receptors of D. melanogaster : The most conspicuous feature of the molecular evolution of the 5-HT receptor loci is the nonrandom distribution of amino acid polymorphisms relative to structural features of the predicted proteins, which implies the operation of purifying selection. The C-terminal intracellular domain and the membrane-spanning helices are relatively devoid of replacement substitutions, whereas the N-terminal extracellular domain and cytoplasmic loop are quite polymorphic. Compared with another membrane receptor protein that we have also sequenced in the same lines, the tyrosine kinase EGFR, which harbors just a single common amino acid variant, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B are more variable than might be expected of pleiotropic proteins with essential physiological roles. However, the ratio of replacement to synonymous substitutions is in the normal range for Drosophila proteins, and there is no statistical evidence for departure from assumptions of neutral theory for the loci as a whole.
On the other hand, there is a clear footprint of divergence between the North Carolina and California populations in intron 1 of 5-HT1A for a haplotype that consists of seven polymorphisms. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the alignment of these sites into two haplotypes could affect splicing efficiency (Kirby et al. 1995;
Chen and Stephan 2003). Strong positive selection such as that observed at the cytochrome P450 Cyp6g1 locus, which is attributed to the emergence of insecticide resistance, leaves a footprint covering tens of kilobases (Daborn et al. 2002) that is unlike the highly restricted nature of the differentiated haplotype detected here. The drop-off in both linkage disequilibrium and population stratification occurs sharply within a hundred bases while the haplotype itself is 􏱔500 bases. This pattern is also inconsistent with admixture, and most likely reflects weak selection, with the sharp boundaries of the haplotype maintained either as a result of unequal recombination probabilities along the gene (Li and Stephens 2003; Wall and Pritchard 2003) or as selection in favor of the integrity of the entire haplotype (Kelly and Wade 2000; but see discussion in Baines et al. 2002; Dworkin et al. 2003). Differential selection pressures in the two populations could most simply reflect some environmental difference or an epistatic interaction between the haplotype and some other site that is at a different frequency in North Carolina and California. Molecular and physiological surveys along geographic clines could conceivably resolve this issue, although it is quite possible that the heart rate phenotype is simply a correlated response with another, unknown, phenotype that is the actual target of selection.
Association between the serotonin receptors and heart rate phenotypes: The most direct evidence for association is between a cluster of sites adjacent to exon 3

and both heart rate and heart rate variability. Neither association alone exceeds the standard multiple comparison threshold, but weak association with both traits was detected. However, permutation testing suggests this might be due to the genetic correlation between the two traits. The stronger association was actually observed with HRV, which can be regarded as a measure of arrhythmia. Physiologically, it is not unreasonable to suppose that a serotonin receptor would actually regulate the consistency of heart rate over several beats, rather than the basal rate itself, but we have no idea over what number of beats such a homeostasis mechanism would operate. More fundamentally, it is not known what normal physiological role serotonin plays in regulating the Drosophila dorsal vessel, which may have an intrinsic rate of contraction set by molecules such as the potassium channels, but is also innervated by cardioactive neuropeptide-secreting cells (Dulcis and Levine 2003). In the absence of any knowledge of the molecular effect of the SNPs (222824, 222844, and 222853 in AE003797), the association should be regarded as suggestive at best and may simply represent a false positive.
The other evidence for association was specifically with heart rate, but involves a highly complex interaction among genotype, sex, and population for one SNP that exceeds the conservative experimentwise threshold and several linked triallelic SNPs. These sites do not form a haplotype, and several other SNPs in the region show similar levels of linkage disequilibrium but do not associate with heart rate, so it is likely that variation in the region is shaped by effects of two or more SNPs. No evidence for synergistic or antagonistic interactions was observed, but with a sample of just 200 chromosomes power to detect epistasis is low. Again, the heart rate association might be a correlated response with a more biologically relevant behavioral or physiological effect. It will be difficult to tease apart proximate causes, but our analysis does suggest that subtle and complex interactions contribute to the genetics of synaptic transmission in flies.
By contrast, we have not been able to find evidence that amino acid polymorphisms in the serotonin receptors have a quantitative effect on heart rate, a trait that is known to be affected by serotonin. Similarly, preliminary analysis of two potassium channel genes failed to provide evidence for association with heart rate (N. Nikoh, A. Duty and G. Gibson, unpublished results), so this is a situation in which common polymorphisms in five of the most likely candidate proteins do not account for more than a few percent of the trait variance. No attempt has been made here to comprehensively survey regulatory regions of the serotonin receptors, so it remains possible that a handful of major-effect regulatory SNPs contribute to the variation. Alternatively, summation of small effects of numerous sites throughout the surveyed loci and/or large effects of rare alleles that would go unnoticed in association studies could be contributing
to trait variation. Taken together, the evidence reported here is consistent with the hypothesis that very weak selection that is sex specific and structured by population helps shape neurophysiological variation in Drosophila. This is hardly a surprising conclusion, but is worth bearing in mind as attention increasingly focuses on those handful of cases in which sites of major effect seem to account for highly complex behavioral phenotypes.
