Abstract
Success of species assignment using DNA barcodes has been shown to vary among plant lineages because of a wide range of different factors. In this study, we confirm the theoretical prediction that gene flow influences species assignment with simulations and a literature survey. We show that the genome experiencing the highest gene flow is, in the majority of the cases, the best suited for species delimitation. Our results clearly suggest that, for most angiosperm groups, plastid markers will not be the most appropriate for use as DNA barcodes. We therefore advocate shifting the focus from plastid to nuclear markers to achieve an overall higher success using DNA barcodes.

In a recent review in PloS One, Hollingsworth et al. (2011) provided a timely reappraisal of the potentials and shortcomings of the plant DNA barcode. The DNA barcode initiative has united scientists on an ambitious project aiming at barcoding Life on Earth (Hebert et al. 2003; Savolainen et al. 2005). The seminal idea was to identify and promote the use of a unique DNA sequence that would enable the identification of any given species as quickly and accurately as possible. This approach has been advocated as a necessary tool to address the persistent lack of experts for species identification and the growing need for biodiversity and ecological assessments in the context of increasing species and habitat loss (Chase & Fay 2009; Valentini et al. 2009). It is also seen as an opportunity for the renaissance of taxonomy (Hajibabaei et al. 2007; Miller 2007) and as a help for species description and characterization. Consequently, an increasing number of studies have been published over recent years (Fig. 1) with special sections on barcoding introduced in different journals such as Molecular Ecology Resources or Taxon. The wide range of applications for DNA barcoding and number of groups of organisms that have now been studied using DNA barcoding techniques also highlighted several challenges that will have to be considered to improve its efficiency. Hollingsworth et al. (2011) took advantage of this large body of data, and their

review was therefore able to touch on some essential elements that should become the focus of further developments in DNA barcoding.
In their article, Hollingsworth et al. (2011) developed four major themes: (i) the selection of plant barcodes; (ii) the factors influencing discrimination success; (iii) the applications of DNA barcodes; and (iv) the research, tools and technology required. While points i, iii and iv are familiar topics of discussion among the barcode community, some aspects developed in point (ii) are novel and deserve more attention. Hollingsworth et al. (2011) rapidly reviewed the effect of the mode and tempo of speciation, polyploidization, hybridization and introgression, life history traits, breeding systems, on the barcode discrimination success.
In our opinion, Hollingsworth et al. (2011) has highlighted an element essential to the debate that may have important consequences on the barcoding strategy. They indeed comment on a study by Petit & Excoffier (2009), which predicts that markers associated with elevated gene flow should be the best suited for discriminating species. This is clearly the case with animals for which part of the COI gene is used as the standard barcode. This DNA region is located in the mitochondrion and is inherited by females that are, on average, greater dispersers. A different pattern arises with plants, or at least with most angiosperms, because plastids have an overall lower dispersal distance and less gene flow than the

         nucleus. The dispersal abilities of seeds or spores and pollen are extremely different and vary widely between plant lineages. Pollen generally disperses at longer distances than seeds in angiosperms and gymnosperms (Ghazoul 2005; Petit et al. 2005), and indirect methods using molecular markers showed that this is not restricted to wind-pollinated species. For instance, Silene vulgaris and S. alba, which are mostly pollinated by bees
or moths (Ghazoul 2005), display a pollen-to-seed gene flow ratio that varies between 9 and 11, while for the wind-pollinated Pinus tree species, this ratio ranges only between 24 and 44 (Ouborg et al. 1999). Conversely, DNA barcoding in bryophytes has been successful using plastid sequences proposed by the CBOL (Hollingsworth et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2010; von Cra ̈utlein et al. 2011) with spores dispersing long distances, often crossing continental barriers. Hollingsworth et al. (2011) therefore suggest that ‘plastid plant barcodes have a built-in limitation to tracking species boundaries in some cases’. We think this is more than a limitation and we argue that sequences from the plastid genome are in fact not the best molecular markers to ensure good species delimitation across all plant groups. We further suggest that dispersal should be taken into account when choosing sequences as DNA barcodes to optimize species assignment in plants.
Assessing which type of markers should be suitable for plant species discrimination is complicated by the relative dispersal abilities of seeds and pollen, as explained above, but also by differing plastid and mitochondrial inheritance, depending on the species. For organelles, the general rule states that plastids are inherited through seeds in more than 80% of angiosperms (Birky 2008) and through pollen in gymnosperms. However, many exceptions exist (Reboud & Zeyl 1994; Mogensen 1996; Birky 1995) and include strict paternal, rare paternal or biparental inheritance as well as maternal inheritance in gymnosperms (Whittle & Johnston 2002; Table1). The situation for the mitochondrion is simpler, with maternal

inheritance for most land plants (bryophytes, angiosperms and gymnosperms), paternal inheritance for some gymnosperms (Mogensen 1996; Whittle & Johnston 2002; Table 1) and paternal or biparental inheritance in a few rare cases across land plants (Reboud & Zeyl 1994; Whittle & Johnston 2002; Barr et al. 2005; Birky 2008). Therefore, the prediction of which genome should be used to ensure good species assignment in plants will depend, amongst other traits, on organelle inheritance and dispersal abilities. These two characteristics are, however, often not known precisely enough for most species and thus only general and imperfect rules can be proposed in such cases (Table 1).
The prediction of Petit & Excoffier (2009) that markers associated with elevated gene flow should be the best suited for discriminating species and was tested using computer simulations and a literature survey. First, three species, diverging at different periods of time from a common ancestor, were simulated using a stepping-stone migration model (Fig. 2a). In this simple model, species
or groups of species with low population structure are shown to be easier to assign using DNA barcode than species with higher genetic structure (Fig. 2b). Population structure within a species has indeed been shown to increase the species effective population size, resulting in a deeper time of coalescence (Petit & Excoffier 2009), sometimes exceeding the time of speciation and thus leading to lineage sorting. Second, literature was reviewed to include studies containing a direct comparison of barcode markers from different genomes in specific groups (Table 2). Floristic studies were excluded because it is not possible to infer any gene flow or plastid inheritance for an assemblage of plant families that usually includes both angiosperms and gymnosperms. In all instances, only studies that used the same assignment method for both types of markers were included. The discrimination success was calculated in different ways, computing the proportion of sequences attributed without ambiguity to the true species, reporting the calculations carried out by the authors themselves or

(b) Assignment success of a given sample to its true species for different migration rates using the simulated sequence data depending on migration rates. Three species (A, B and C) were simulated, each including 20 populations and one outgroup. Population structure followed a two-dimensional stepping-stone model (deme size fixed to 1000) and speciation events occurred by vicariance of an ancestral species that existed T = 200 000 generations ago (divergence time from the outgroup). The first species to appear (species C) diverged from the original 60 ancestral populations T ⁄ 2 generations ago. At that time, the 60 populations were split into 20 populations for species C and 40 that represented the ancestor of species A and B. Then, at T ⁄ 4 generations ago, the 40 populations of the ancestor of species A and B split again into two groups of 20 populations. Each new species was created from adjacent populations. Migration was allowed within each species (ancestral or extant) and followed, as mentioned above, a stepping-stone model, but was forbidden between populations of different species starting from the vicariance event. A total of 100 simulations were obtained with the software SIMCOAL2.0 (Laval & Excoffier 2004) by simulating DNA sequences of 1000 nucleotides long for three individuals per population using the HKY85 model of evolution and assuming a mutation rate of 10)8 ⁄ bp per generation. Migration rates were constant through time and ranged between 0.00001 and 0.1. A phylogenetic tree was built for each simulated data set in PhyML (Guindon & Gascuel 2003) using the HKY85 + Gamma model. The performance of DNA barcoding under the simulated conditions was assessed by measuring the proportion of individuals that were in the largest monophyletic clade for each species.

using the software BRONX (Little 2011). For the latter analysis, the corresponding sequences were retrieved from GenBank with the disadvantage that some references could not be included because of the unavailability of the corresponding data. Moreover, studies that had not analysed multiple specimens per species were also discarded. To ensure a solid comparison, sequences were carefully checked and only the ones that could be referred to the same identified voucher for both the organelle and the nuclear markers were kept for the analysis. This unfortunately again decreased the number of specimens and species that could be included in the analyses. Each sequence was then queried against the full data set, and a
percentage of correct assignment was calculated by counting the number of times the correct species was recovered divided by all the queries carried out. Following Siegel & Castellan (2000), Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for two groups arranged as paired observations were used to test the hypothesis that markers associated with high dispersal have better discrimination success. The first Wilcoxon test was computed on all the studies cited in Table 2 (N = 28), and the second one on those that could be analysed with BRONX (N = 16). All observations that were congruent with the prediction made by Petit & Excoffier (2009) were marked as positive ranks (W+). The Wilcoxon test was highly significant for the 28 published

assignments listed in Table 2 (P < 0.01) as well as for those analysed by the software BRONX (P < 0.01). This is a good indication that the ‘gene flow hypothesis’ might have a significant role in explaining the success or failure of DNA barcoding using specific markers in plants.
DNA barcoding is starting to play a significant role in several areas of biology, and the potential benefits of such an identification tool are immense. As illustrated by Hollingsworth et al. (2011), the plant DNA barcode has helped address significant evolutionary questions, but evolutionary biology could also play an essential role in defining suitable barcodes, and this should be more acknowledged. Species’ evolutionary histories, their modes and tempo of speciation, their life history traits, life forms, or mating systems (Fazekas et al. 2009; Hollingsworth et al. 2011), as well as their demography (Currat et al. 2008; Du et al. 2011a), have a major influence on assignment success, and this is particularly true for the land plants. Integrating all these factors into the DNA barcoding strategy would be beneficial for DNA barcode applications. This could resolve several outstanding questions such as: Are DNA barcodes expected to work better on annuals than on long-lived perennial plants, on temperate or on tropical species, on selfing or outcrossing species? These questions will only be answered by using multiple genes from different genomes, depending on dispersal characteristics of the species being analysed, to optimize the correct assignment of samples to the corresponding species. Such an approach is not mere wishful thinking but is becoming more feasible with next generation sequencing techniques. A shift towards an integrated approach to DNA barcoding should therefore be envisaged for the future. This would create a fascinating opportunity for different disciplines of biology to meet and work together towards a better understanding of biodiversity on Earth.
