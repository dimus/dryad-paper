In organisms with complex life cycles, fitness often increases with body size at the transition from larva to adult. The translation of larval size into fitness, however, can depend on the source of size variation, with size, per se, not always increasing adult success. In parasitic worms, many factors influence larval growth, but little is known about the consequences of this growth variation. We examined how the size of the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus in its copepod first intermediate host affects infection success and growth in the stickleback second host. Moreover, we assessed whether the conspicuous growth variation caused by copepod size is fitness-relevant. Using larvae of the same age, we found that larger worms had a substantially higher infection probability and they tended to still be slightly larger after several months of growth in fish. However, big larvae from bigger copepods did not have higher fitness, suggesting that being large relative to the host, but not necessarily large in general, is important. These findings clarify some aspects of the life history strategy of S. solidus (e.g. why there is a flat ontogenetic reaction norm across copepod stages), but also raise questions (e.g. why growth costs have been hard to document). More generally, our results indicate that larval size can correlate with fitness in helminths, but that not all size variation is predictive of success in the next host.
Animals with complex life cycles live in distinct habitats as larvae and adults. In a variety of taxa, individuals that achieve a large body size at the transition between habitats have higher growth, survival, or fecundity as adults (Semlitsch et al. 1988, Scott 1994, Paradis et al. 1996, Taylor et al. 1998, Phillips 2002, Altwegg and Reyer 2003, De Block and Stoks 2005), thereby coupling larval and adult success (Ebenman 1992, Moran 1994). The correlation between larval size and fitness may arise if a big size is itself beneficial or if size is reflective of some other characteristic related to fitness, such as physiological condition (Blanckenhorn 2000, Berner and Blanckenhorn 2007). In the first case, large larvae might have lower mortality in the adult habitat (e.g. via a shorter growth period until the minimum size for reproduction or lower exposure to size-selective predators) or increased reproductive success (e.g. via a higher mating probability and/or fecundity). In the second case, big larvae may simply be in better condition, having accumulated more resources to allocate to the various functions necessary for survival and reproduction in the adult habitat (Van Noordwijk and de Jong 1986). This is not a trivial distinction, because there are several examples of larval size and fitness being partially decoupled under some environmental conditions, indicating that larval size alone is not always predictive of adult success (Rolff et al. 2004, Stoks et al. 2005, Campero et al. 2008, Van Allen et al. 2010). Most life history models assume that larval size is simply translated into fitness (Werner and Gilliam 1984, Rowe and Ludwig 1991, Abrams and Rowe
1996, Abrams et al. 1996, Day and Rowe 2002, Parker et al. 2003a, 2009a, Iwasa and Wada 2006, Ball et al. 2008). To ascertain the validity of this assumption, we must identify the environmental conditions under which larval size does and does not have a carryover effect on adult performance.
Many helminths (􏰰parasitic worms) have complex life cycles in which they infect one or more intermediate hosts before being transmitted to a definitive host in which they reproduce. The factors influencing larval helminth growth are well studied (e.g. host size: Dezfuli et al. 2001, Benesh and Valtonen 2007, temperature: Halvorsen and Skorping 1982, Scholz 1991, intensity: reviewed by Benesh 2011), but little is known about the consequences of this growth variation for performance in the next host. At least in some circumstances, though, bigger is better. Large larvae can have higher infection success in the next host (Rosen and Dick 1983, Tierney and Crompton 1992, Steinauer and Nickol 2003), and for worms that complete most of their growth as larvae, a large size increases adult fecundity (Schärer et al. 2001). There is also indirect evidence for size benefits. Older larvae that have had an extended period of growth can be better at infecting and exploiting the next host (Mueller 1966, Hammerschmidt et al. 2009). Also, the manipulation of host phenotype increases with larval size in some parasites, suggesting that transmission might be delayed to permit additional growth (Ness and Foster 1999, Brown et al. 2001, Benesh et al. 2009). Nonetheless, there are hints that, like free-living organisms, transitional helminth size may not

always have a straightforward relationship with fitness. Both Fredensborg and Poulin (2005) and Dörücü et al. (2007) found fecundity to depend not only on larval worm size, but also on whether the intermediate host was shared with other helminths. More experiments with known sources of larval size variation are clearly needed to evaluate how reliably size predicts infection and exploitation of the next host.
In this study, we examined the relationship between larval size and fitness in a tapeworm, Schistocephalus solidus. This species infects copepods as first host, in which it grows to an infective stage called a procercoid before being trophicallytransmitted to three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, the second intermediate host (Clarke 1954). Growth in copepods is clearly affected by environmental factors like host size, host food intake, and infection intensity (Wedekind 1997, Michaud et al. 2006, Benesh 2010a), but it also seems to have a genetic component (Hammerschmidt and Kurtz 2005, Benesh 2010a, b). However, it is not clear if any of this size variation is fitness-relevant. Full-sib worm families that grow large in copepods tend to induce a lower innate immune response in fish, but this does not clearly increase establishment success or growth in fish (Hammerschmidt and Kurtz 2005). Infection success in fish increases with procercoid age, from about 11 to 15 days post infection of copepods (Hammerschmidt et al. 2009). Worms grow during this time (Clarke 1954, Michaud et al. 2006), so either increased parasite age or size could be responsible for the elevated infection rate. Thus, larval size seems important in some situations, such as when bigger larvae are also older larvae, but not in others, such as when size variation is between worm families. Here we report the results of experiments in which we exposed sticklebacks to procercoids of variable size, but of the same age. We recorded two fitness correlates, infection success (i.e. establishment probability) and plerocercoid size after a period of growth in fish. We first tested whether there is a relationship between larval size and fitness, and then we assessed whether the very conspicuous larval size variation caused by copepod size is fitness-relevant.
Methods
Study system
Schistocephalus solidus is a simultaneous hermaphrodite with a three-host life cycle. Adult worms inhabit the intestine of fish-eating birds, where they mate and produce eggs. The eggs are released into the environment. Free-swimming, coracidia larvae hatch from the eggs and are eaten by freshwater copepods. Parasites invade the copepods’ body cavity and develop to infective procercoids. Transmission to the second intermediate host, three-spined sticklebacks, occurs when an infected copepod is eaten. Parasites, now called plerocercoids, grow for several weeks in sticklebacks before they are able to infect birds.
Worms were dissected from infected sticklebacks, weighed, and then bred in pairs in an in vitro breeding system that simulates a bird gut (developed by Smyth 1946 and modified by Wedekind 1997). All worms used for breeding were larger than the apparent threshold size for maturation
(50 mg; Tierney and Crompton 1992). Pairs were formed according to size, so as to promote outcrossing (Lüscher and Milinski 2003). Eggs were collected and stored at 4°C until needed.
Infection protocol and procercoid size measurements
In several experiments, worms were measured in vivo shortly before being used to infect sticklebacks. The protocol for infecting copepods, measuring procercoids, and infecting fishes was the same in all cases.
Copepods, Macrocyclops albidus, from a laboratory culture were experimentally infected (culture details described by Van der Veen and Kurtz 2002). Tapeworm eggs were incubated at 20°C for three weeks in the dark and then exposed to light one day before use to induce hatching. Copepods were individually isolated in the wells of a 24-well microtitre plate (∼1.5 ml per well), exposed to a single coracidium, and then kept at 18°C with a 18:6 L:D cycle. At 13 days post exposure (DPE), the area of larval worms was measured. Copepods were placed on a microscope slide and photographed two times. Worm area was measured using the freeware Image J 1.38x (W. S. Rasband, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, 􏰱http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/􏰲, 1997–2009) and the two measurements were averaged to give values for individual worms. Worm area was calculated without the cercomer, because the outline of the cercomer is often difficult to clearly observe in vivo. Additionally, copepod length was measured from the eye to the end of the cephalothorax (Van der Veen and Kurtz 2002). Procercoid area (μm2) and copepod length (mm) were used as the units of size measurement in all analyses, because transformations to mass, as proposed by Wedekind et al. (2000), resulted in poorer statistical models (lower r2 and heterogeneously distributed residuals).
Several days before exposure, lab-bred, naïve fish were individually isolated in small tanks (18􏰳13􏰳11 cm), and a dorsal spine was clipped to provide DNA for later identification. Each fish was exposed to a single, infected copepod one day after procercoid area was measured (14 DPE). Several days after exposure, fish were transferred to larger tanks (30 􏰳 22 􏰳 25 cm) (with the exception of one exposure, see below), maintained at densities between 4 and 15, and fed three times per week ad libitum with chironomids and frozen cladocera. The exposed fish were eventually killed and dissected to determine infection, and a piece of the tail was taken for DNA extraction. By taking fish tissue samples both before exposure and after dissection, we were able to identify individual fish, and thus know to which procercoid it was exposed, without maintaining fish in individual tanks. DNA was extracted from spine and tail clips with the Qiagen DNeasy 96 Blood and Tissue Extraction Kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol. Nine microsatellite loci were amplified by PCR in two multiplex PCR reactions (conditions given in Kalbe et al. 2009).
Validating in vivo size measurements
Several authors have measured larval tapeworms within their copepod intermediate hosts (Wagner 1954, Klekowski and Guttowa 1968, Wootten 1974, Dupont and Gabrion
2

1987, Scholz 1991, Wedekind et al. 2000, Michaud et al. 2006). Errors in these in vivo measurements may be caused by factors such as copepod transparency, worm orientation, and/or worm movement. To our knowledge, no study has validated the accuracy of in vivo measurements by comparing them with ex vivo measurements. In two preliminary studies, worm area was measured in vivo before dissecting procercoids from copepods and again measuring area. In the first experiment, worms infected juvenile copepods (copepodite stages 1–3) and were measured 11 days post infection, whereas in the second experiment, worms were measured in adult male copepods 21 days after infection. The correlation between in vivo and ex vivo measurements was high and significant in both cases (Pearson correlations, first experiment, n􏰰90, r􏰰0.87, p􏰱0.0001; second experiment, n􏰰66, r 􏰰 0.774, p 􏰱 0.0001), indicating the in vivo measurements are reasonably representative of worm size. Juvenile copepods are relatively transparent, but in adult male copepods, the outlines of worms located underneath the copepod’s intestine are difficult to recognize. Accordingly, in the second experiment, the correlation of in vivo and ex vivo measurements was lower for worms under the host’s intestine than for those above it (below intestine, n􏰰29, r􏰰0.643; above intestine, n􏰰37, r􏰰0.935). Therefore, in the experiments involving adult male copepods, area was only measured for worms located above the copepod’s intestine. The ex vivo size of worms above and below the intestine did not significantly differ (t-test, t64􏰰1.109, p􏰰0.272), so although the measured worms are a non-random sample, there is no reason to expect that this causes bias.
Description of the individual experiments
In several experiments, we measured procercoid area and two components of worm fitness in fish: infection success and plerocercoid weight. Plerocercoid weight is related to fecundity in S. solidus, at least for in vitro breeding (Schärer et al. 2001; but also see Tierney and Crompton 1992). These experiments were designed to answer various questions (results to be published elsewhere), so they differ in a number of respects (Table 1), but they can be placed into three main categories based on the copepods used: 1) large copepods of similar size (adult males), 2) small copepods of similar size (copepodite stages 1–3), and 3) copepods of various sizes (copepodites to adults). A primary distinction between these experiments is that in the third experiment we used a range of copepod stages to produce host-size-induced variation in procercoid area, while in the first two experiments we tried to eliminate such systematic variation in procercoid area.
Infections with large copepods
This experiment was performed twice. A range of parasite clutches (14 or 21) were used to infect adult male copepods. Adult male copepods were fed 3 freshly hatched Artemia salina nauplii every other day. Full-sib fish families were bred from parents collected in Lake Skogseidvatnet, Norway for use in the infection. Three months after infection, fish were dissected to determine infection status and plerocercoid weight. By this time, worms have approached an asymptotic size (Scharsack et al. 2007).
Infections with small copepods
This experiment was replicated three times, several months apart. Copepods of a limited size range (juveniles, copepodite stages 1 to 3) were exposed to many different parasite clutches, and were then fed just one A. salina every other day. Several full-sib fish families from the lake Grosser Plöner See were used in the experiment. Sticklebacks were dissected after about 2.5 to 3 months, so that plerocercoids had reached an asymptotic size.
Infections with various-sized copepods
For two different fish exposures, all available copepods stages were infected, with the exception of nauplii. Every other day, copepods were fed with either three A. salina or ∼ 100 paramecium. Food items alternated between feeding days (i.e. artemia, paramecium, artemia, etc). Sticklebacks from six lab-bred, full-sib families from the lake Grosser Plöner See were exposed to worms from one of two parasite populations: Skogseidvatnet, Norway or the Neustädter Binnenwasser in Northern Germany. The Neustädter Binnenwasser is ∼ 25 km from the Grosser Plöner See, so these are nearly sympatric populations. The two worm populations differ in their growth in fish (Kalbe and Jakobsen unpubl.), and the goal of these experiments was to assess how variation in the growth of S. solidus affects host susceptibility to other parasites. In a “control” infection, fish were exposed to both parasite populations and then maintained in the laboratory, where there was no mortality. Six weeks post infection fish were dissected. Plerocercoid growth slows around this time, but worms have not yet reached a final size (Scharsack et al. 2007).
In the main infection, fish were exposed to worms from one of the two populations and then placed into cages in the Grosser Plöner See. The fish were left in the lake from mid May to mid August 2009, and during this time there was

Two fitness correlates were measured in every experiment: infection success and plerocercoid weight. The copepods used in the experiments were either large (adult males), small (copepodite stage1 to 3), or mixed in size (copepodite stage 1 to adult males). For each experiment, there were two or three replicate fish exposures.

∼55% mortality. This mortality was not clearly related to procercoid area (logistic regression, p􏰰0.467), so the procercoid area–fitness relationship is not obviously biased by the dead, ‘missing’ fish in this experiment.
Data analyses
We analyzed the data in three steps. First, we assessed the procercoid size–fitness relationship in the three experiments. Then, after establishing the existence of such a relationship, we explored whether the fitness-relevant variation in procercoid area is environmentally-induced (i.e. attributable to variation in copepod length). Finally, we analyzed the combined dataset to generalize the relationship. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.) and R 2.9.2. (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). The dataset has been deposited online in the Dryad database (􏰱http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3539q70r􏰲).
Analyses of individual experiments
For each experiment, logistic regression was used to assess the factors influencing infection success, whereas a general linear model was used to assess plerocercoid weight. Three predictors besides procercoid area were used in all analyses: fish weight at exposure (covariate), exposure replicate (factor), and fish sex (factor). Additionally, the parasite population (NO or NST) was included as a factor for the mixed-copepod-size experiment. Procercoids grow larger in larger copepods (Wedekind et al. 2000, Hammerschmidt and Kurtz 2005, Michaud et al. 2006, Benesh 2010a; in the pooled dataset here, 74% of the variation in procercoid area was explained by copepod length). If a bigger absolute size entails higher fitness, this growth plasticity may be adaptive. To assess this, we re-analyzed the individual experiments with copepod length included as a covariate. We had several expectations if absolute size variation is important. First, copepod length should be a significant covariate or at least its inclusion should greatly inflate the standard error for procercoid area if they explain the same fitness variation (i.e. collinearity). Second, fitness should be higher in the experiments in which larger copepods were used. Third, the effect of procercoid area should be most pronounced in the third experiment where copepod length varied most, simply because a wide range of environmentally-induced procercoid sizes should make a correlation with fitness easier to observe.
Analysis of the combined dataset
We analyzed the full dataset with the goal of generalizing the relationship between procercoid size and fitness, while controlling the effects of other factors. Generalized linear models were constructed for both infection success (binomial errors, logit link function) and plerocercoid weight (Gaussian errors, identity link function). Model building was guided by the outcome of the individual experiments, as described in the Results. The ‘best’ model was used to draw simulations of the predicted procercoid area–fitness relationship (using asymptotic approximation) and to produce confidence intervals. This was performed with the Zelig R package (Imai et al. 2008).
Results
The relationship between procercoid area and infection success
Infection success increased significantly with procercoid area in the two experiments with a restricted set of copepod stages, but not in the experiment using a mix of stages (Table 2, Fig. 1A), despite the fact that procercoid size varied the most in this mixed experiment (highest SD, Table 1). Fish mass and fish sex had no clear effect on infection probability in any experiment, but the infection rate differed between replicate exposures in the ‘small copepod’ experiment (Table 2). The overall infection rates estimated for the three experiments with large, small, and mixed copepods were 0.38, 0.31, and 0.65, respectively. It seems that small procercoids can achieve an infection rate similar to worms that are twice as large, although this comparison must be made cautiously given the experiments were not identical in every respect.
We further explored the importance of host-size-induced variation in worm size by adding copepod length into the logistic regression models for each experiment. Copepod length was not a significant covariate in any case (all p􏰲0.40), and its addition did not substantially inflate the estimated standard errors for the procercoid area regression coefficient (SE increased by 20% at most), which signifies limited collinearity between procercoid area and copepod length. This suggests that large procercoids, not necessarily from big copepods, had an increased chance to infect fish (Fig. 1B).

χ21 􏰰 2.13, p 􏰰 0.144), but tellingly the parameter estimate was negative. Coupled with the positive effect of procercoid area, this suggests that infection probability tended to be high for big procercoids in small copepods, i.e. for large relative sizes. Finally, we added a procercoid area by experiment interaction (Wald χ22 􏰰 11.43, p 􏰰 0.003) to account for the weak effect of procercoid area in the ‘mixed’ copepod experiment. Figure 2 shows the relationship between procercoid area and infection probability predicted by this model. The wide confidence intervals for the infection probability of large procercoids reflect the uncertainty in the relationship introduced by the interaction term. The estimated infection probability for relatively small larvae (one SD below the mean) was 12% while that of relatively large ones (one SD above the mean) was 68%, suggesting there is a substantial increase in infection probability with larval size.
The relationship between procercoid area and plerocercoid weight
Larger procercoids tended to grow to a larger size after infecting sticklebacks (Fig. 3), although this was only significant in the mixed copepod stage infection (Table 3). Additionally, plerocercoid size increased with initial fish mass in all experiments, it was higher in male fish in the small copepod experiment, it varied between exposures within experiments, and as expected it differed between parasite populations in the mixed copepod experiment (Table 3). Adding copepod length to the analyses did not affect these conclusions. It was not significant in any experiment (all p􏰲0.16), nor did its addition pronouncedly inflate the standard error for procercoid area (increase of 25% at the most).
For the analysis of the combined data (n􏰰342), we included procercoid area, replicate exposure, initial fish mass, fish sex, and parasite population as terms in the model. Copepod length was also included to control for variation

In accordance with these observations, the following generalized linear model was constructed to analyze the pooled dataset (n􏰰1014). Procercoid area and replicate exposure were included as terms, both of which were clearly significant (Wald χ2􏰲20.76, p􏰱0.0001).

experiment interaction did not improve the model (LRT, χ22 􏰰 0.014, p 􏰰 0.99, AIC 3387 vs 3391). This model predicted a relatively large procercoid (one SD above the mean) to be about 23 mg bigger than a relatively small procercoid (one SD below the mean) (Fig. 4). Thus, all else equal, large procercoids tend to grow to be slightly larger plerocercoids.
Discussion
Individual Schistocephalus solidus tapeworms that grew larger in copepods had a higher probability to infect sticklebacks, the next host, and they tended to grow to a slightly bigger size in fish. However, it is not clear that a big larval size, in an absolute sense, is advantageous. Although the experiments involving larger copepods and thus larger procercoids (largeand mixed-stage experiments) were characterized by somewhat higher establishment probabilities, within experiments larvae from big copepods did not have higher infection success or growth in fish. Substantial copepod-size-induced variation in procercoid area may even obscure the correlation with fitness. The only experiment where an effect of procercoid size on infection probability was not detected was that with the most host-induced size variation. What appears more important is a large relative size, i.e. large relative to the host and relative to the experimental conditions.
What causes the size-fitness correlation?
We propose two explanations for the correlation between procercoid size and fitness: 1) relative, but not absolute, size

reflects condition, and/or 2) relative size reflects developmental variation between individuals. These two explanations are non-exclusive, as both depend on resource acquisition. For instance, large worms may have the resources to invest in energy storage as well as ontogeny, which appears energy intensive in similar systems (Klekowski and Guttowa 1968).
In free-living organisms, larval size often indicates quality; big larvae grew in better conditions or were better adapted to the prevailing conditions (Hentschel and Emlet 2000, Morey and Reznick 2000, Phillips 2002, Altwegg and Reyer 2003, De Block and Stoks 2005). Having acquired more resources, large larvae have more energy to allocate to the various functions necessary for survival and reproduction in the adult habitat (Van Noordwijk and de Jong 1986, Reznick et al. 2000). Larval condition is probably critical for parasites, given that infection of the next host is likely an energetically-demanding process (Archer and Hopkins 1958, Marra and Esch 1970, Smyth and McManus 1989). In some trophically-transmitted helminths, larvae that experience little competition for host resources, and therefore grow larger, have higher fitness (Rosen and Dick 1983, Steinauer and Nickol 2003, Fredensborg and Poulin 2005), supporting the notion of larval size as a proxy for condition. It was therefore surprising that in the case of S. solidus, large worms that grew in large copepods, supposedly a good, resource-rich environment, did not clearly have higher fitness. Absolute procercoid size is thus not an unambiguous indicator of quality. Relative size could correlate with condition if growth plasticity, the increase in procercoid area with copepod size, is a passive process, such as a change in cell size (Arendt 2007), whereas growth beyond the hostsize-determined expectation is related to resource uptake.
After 14 days in copepods, the time of all our fish exposures, worms look morphologically mature (Benesh 2010a), but infection success appears to increase with age until about
15 DPE (Hammerschmidt et al. 2009). Growth in copepods is positively correlated with development within copepod stages, but not between them, i.e. fast relative growth increases development rate, but copepod-size-induced growth variation does not systematically affect development (Benesh 2010a, b). Thus, relatively large procercoids at 14 DPE may have increased infectivity because they are more developed. Ontogenetic variation at transmission can have surprisingly long-lasting effects in S. solidus. Hammerschmidt et al. (2009) found that young procercoids transmitted at 11 DPE have reduced growth in fish for several weeks compared to older procercoids. And we found that large procercoids tended to still be larger after several months of growth in fish, although this effect was quite weak. One could test if ontogenetic variation underlies the size–fitness correlation by measuring whether the effect of larval size on adult fitness decreases with larval age.
What are the consequences of the size-fitness correlation?
The consequences of this correlation depend on the source of relative size variation, and both hostand parasiterelated factors are probably important. Starving copepods and reducing their condition decreases larval tapeworm growth (Shostak and Dick 1986, Benesh 2010a), but it has not been tested whether such a size reduction results in a proportional decrease in fitness. On the parasite side, relative procercoid size varies between full-sib clutches of S. solidus (Hammerschmidt and Kurtz 2005, Benesh 2010a, b), suggesting there is genetic variation in how efficiently worms acquire nutrients. It would be worthwhile to establish whether the fitness-relevant variation in procercoid size is mainly caused by the parasite environment (host-related factors) or by parasite genetics.
Selection for higher virulence, increased growth, and larger procercoid sizes may be counteracted by growth costs. Larvae that grow too large or too fast may kill their copepod hosts before transmission occurs (Parker et al. 2003b). However, there is not strong evidence for growth costs at this stage of the S. solidus life cycle. Rapidly growing worms do not induce predation-risky behaviors in copepods; if anything, they reduce them (Benesh 2010b). In multiple infections, where several larvae simultaneously consume host resources, copepod mortality only increases at quite high infection intensities (Wedekind 1997, Franz and Kurtz 2002, van der Veen and Kurtz 2002, Michaud et al. 2006), which is not atypical for larval helminths (Benesh 2011). The absence of an obvious growth cost in the face of apparent selection for a larger procercoid size is something of a conundrum. Perhaps growth costs are only manifested under the right environmental conditions (e.g. low food levels, the presence of certain predators). Alternatively, very rapid growth and development appears favored in helminths that infect copepods as their first host (Benesh et al. 2011), so maybe the larval growth rate of S. solidus is at or near an intrinsic maximum, although most organisms do not grow at maximum rates (Gotthard 2001, Metcalfe and Monaghan 2001, Berner and Blanckenhorn 2007).
The observed relationship between procercoid size and fitness also forces us to re-examine phenotypic plasticity in

the larval life history of helminths. Larval growth varies with intermediate host size in many helminths (Awachie 1966, Uznanski and Nickol 1980, Dezfuli et al. 2001, Poulin et al. 2003, Steinauer and Nickol 2003, Benesh and Valtonen 2007, Benesh 2010a), including S. solidus (Wedekind et al. 2000, Hammerschmidt and Kurtz 2005, Michaud et al. 2006). Generally, this is interpreted as worms taking advantage of the higher nutrient availability to grow to a large, robust size for transmission. However, for S. solidus absolute procercoid area was not clearly related to fitness, suggesting this growth plasticity is not necessarily adaptive. Moreover, assuming transitional size is essentially accrued fitness, many life history models predict that the optimal larval development time varies with growth conditions (Werner and Gilliam 1984, Rowe and Ludwig 1991, Day and Rowe 2002, Parker et al. 2003a, 2009a, b, Iwasa and Wada 2006, Ball et al. 2008). The growth of S. solidus strongly depends on copepod stage, but ontogeny does not (Benesh 2010a). This ontogenetic inflexibility makes sense if absolute size variation does not translate into fitness variation; there is no incentive for worms to adjust their developmental schedule in copepods of different size.
The association between transitional size and fitness is an important factor shaping the life history strategies of complex life cycle parasites. We have studied this relationship in some detail in S. solidus, and although we detected the expected positive correlation, we also found that much of the variation in larval size did not affect success in the next host. This finding sheds light on some aspects of the worm’s life history strategy (e.g. why there is a flat ontogenetic reaction norm across different copepod stages), and also refines expectations about other aspects (e.g. whether growth costs are to be expected at all).
