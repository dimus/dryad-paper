Abstract
We analysed a representative collection of New World sweet potato landraces (329 accessions from Mexico to Peru) with both chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite markers. Both kinds of markers supported the existence of two geographically restricted genepools, corresponding to accessions from the north-western part of South America and accessions from the Caribbean and Central America region. Our conservative cpSSRs markers revealed that the divergence between the two haplotype groups is associated with numerous mutation events concerning various markers, supporting the idea that this divergence may be ancient, predating domestication. For both kinds of markers, we found no significant difference in diversity between the two genepools and detected region-specific alleles in both groups. Previous studies have favoured the hypothesis of a single domestication of this crop. Our analysis suggests at least two independent domestications, in Central⁄Caribbean America and in the north-western part of South America. Sweet potato was then dispersed from these centres throughout tropical America. Comparison of nuclear and chloroplast data suggests that exchanges of clones and sexual reproduction were both important processes in landrace diversification in this clonally propagated crop. Our analysis provides useful tools for rationalizing the conservation and use of sweet potato germplasm collections.

Introduction
Molecular studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of where, when and how crop plants arose (Matsuoka et al. 2002; Sanjur et al. 2002; Chaco ́n et al. 2005; Spooner et al. 2005; Londo et al. 2006). Despite its importance as a staple food, ranked seventh among world crops with an annual production of around 9 Mt and a cultivated area of 110 M ha (Lebot 2010), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. Convolvulaceae) has been relatively neglected and many points of its evolutionary history from domestication to dispersal remain unsolved.

As currently circumscribed, I. batatas is a hexaploid species, vegetatively propagated by farmers but having a sporophytic incompatibility reproduction system, and including mainly domesticated types. Following a taxonomic revision of the I. batatas complex, Austin (1987) proposed that natural hybridization between I. trifida and I. triloba generated the wild ancestors of I. batatas somewhere between the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico and the Orinoco basin in Venezuela. Kobayashi (1984), however, suggested that I. trifida is an autopolyploid complex with different ploidy levels from 2X to 6X, from which I. batatas, the domesticated form, has derived. It is therefore possible that I. batatas could have been generated by natural hybridizations involving several wild species, rather than descending from a single wild ancestor (Lebot

2009). Analysis of molecular markers, including RAPD (Jarret & Austin 1994), microsatellites (Buteler et al. 1999), ISSR and cpRFLP (Huang & Sun 2000) and AFLP (Huang et al. 2002), a phylogenetic analysis based on beta-amylase gene sequences (Rajapakse et al. 2004) and more recently, a cytogenetic study (Srisuwan et al. 2006), have all confirmed the close relationship between I. batatas and I. trifida. Because the natural distribution of I. trifida extends from northern Peru to Mexico (Shiotani et al. 1990), it is logical to assume that the domestication of sweet potato occurred within this vast geographical region, but how, where and how many times remain open questions. A genetic study based on AFLPs indicated that the highest genetic diversity was found in Central America, whereas the lowest was in the PeruEcuador region (Zhang et al. 2000). No region-specific profiles were identified but a significant regional differentiation between Peruvian and Ecuadorian cultivars and other American cultivars was demonstrated. For these authors, the results confirm previous molecular studies and support the hypothesis of Central America or Meso-America as the primary centre of diversity and the most likely centre of origin of domesticated I. batatas. Sweet potato was then dispersed to the Peru-Ecuador region, where a secondary centre of diversity formed. Another genetic study using RAPD markers and 74 sweet potato accessions from its worldwide range confirmed the existence of two distinct genepools in American sweet potato landraces (Gichuki et al. 2003).
Numerous important crops were domesticated in the Americas, including maize (Zea mays), potato (Solanum tuberosum), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cassava (Manihot esculenta) (Pickersgill 2007). Some plants were domesticated once from their wild progenitor in a restricted geographical area, such as maize in Mexico (Matsuoka et al. 2002; Ranere et al. 2009; Van Heerwaarden et al. 2011). Quite frequently, however, species of the same genus were domesticated independently in different areas, as in Cucurbita (Sanjur et al. 2002). More rarely, the same wild ancestral species was domesticated independently in different parts of its distributional range, as in Phaseolus vulgaris (Chaco ́n et al. 2005) and Phaseolus lunatus (Motta-Aldana et al. 2010). Plants domesticated once and that have dispersed quickly and widely from their centre of origin, as peach palm (Bactris gasipaes, Arecaceae) landraces (Clement et al. 2010) or maize (Vigouroux et al. 2008) exhibit clear genetic structure among populations, resulting of isolation by distance, genetic drift and local adaptation. Structure of diversity among landraces results from both domestication and diffusion processes. Appropriate markers and sampling designs are then required to distinguish multiple independent domestication events from scenarios involving diffusion from a single domestication event.
Chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSRs) are useful tools for evolutionary studies at low taxonomic levels, as in crop domestication studies, because they often exhibit geographically informative polymorphism among populations and also among closely related species (Provan et al. 2001). They have, for example, permitted the identification of progenitors and of the geographical origin of domestication (Xu et al. 2002; Imazio et al. 2006; Wills & Burke 2006). A set of conserved primer pairs that flank cpSSRs have been identified from a number of angiosperm species (Bryan et al. 1999; Weising & Gardner 1999), simplifying the use of chloroplast markers for plants for which little sequence information is available. Combining nuclear SSRs, which are more polymorphic and bi-parentally inherited, with the haploid cpSSRS, non-recombinant and usually maternally inherited, permits access to different parts of the history of populations: nuclear SSRs are suitable for studying recent and local evolutionary processes while cpSSRs are effective indicators of population subdivision and differentiation for tracing ancient divergences.
All attempts so far to structure the existing morphological variation found within cultivated I. batatas into meaningful varietal groups have failed because variation appears to be continuous. This is a serious constraint for germplasm curators and especially for breeders, who therefore must rely on comprehensive studies characterizing genepools to identify groups potentially differing in functionally important genetic diversity (Lebot 2010). All genetic studies of American sweet potato landraces have suffered from very restricted sampling and from the use of markers that are to identify consistent genepools and determine their origin inadequate (Zhang et al. 2000; 2001, Gichuki et al. 2003). To investigate genetic diversity in American sweet potato and to analyse the contributions of domestication and post-domestication dispersal in explaining the patterns observed, we examined a comprehensive sample of landraces (329 sweet potato landraces from Mexico to Peru) using both, chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites. We present new insights into the evolutionary history of the crop.
Materials and methods
Analysis with chloroplast markers
Sampling area and plant materials. The sampling area extends from Mexico to Peru with collection sites ranging in elevation from 0 to 2850 m. Among the 4615 sweet potato landraces maintained in the international collection at the International Potato Center (CIP, Lima, Peru) 329 accessions with complete passport data were selected among to cover the entire pre-Columbian range

 of sweet potato cultivation (Fig. 1, Table 1, Table S1, Supporting information).
Healthy young leaves collected from accessions maintained in screen houses or in vitro were freeze dried at CIP and stored at room temperature until use. All extractions were conducted using the Qiagen 96 Plant kit for lyophilised tissues (Hilden, Germany).
Amplification of chloroplast microsatellites. Overall, 44 universal primers (Bryan et al. 1999; Weising and Gardner 1999) were tested on a worldwide subsample of 12 sweet potato landraces from the CIP genebank and only four primers (ccmp2, NTCP 18, NTCP 28, NTCP 26) showed polymorphism. We then developed additional specific primers for Ipomoea species, using the complete chloroplast genome sequence of I. purpurea, available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genebank, to identify all (A)n and (T)n repeats with n £ 10. Forty microsatellites were characterized and we then tested amplification and readable polymorphism on the same worldwide subsample. Three additional markers were selected (Ibcp 5, Ibcp 8 and Ibcp10). Thus a total of seven chloroplast SSRs were used in our study (Table 2).

 All loci were amplified independently using Multiplex PCR Taq (Qiagen) in a final volume of 10 lL. The following program was conducted, using a PTC-100 Thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA) 15min at 95°C⁄30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 1min 30 s at Tm primer (Table 2), 1 min at 72 °C⁄30 min at 60 °C. Ninety-six-well plates were used for amplification and three wells per plate were devoted to negative (one well) and migration controls (two wells). Because cpSSRs have just a one bp mutation step, we checked repeatability by genotyping twice 50 randomly selected samples in the different plates. Genotyping was performed on an ABI 3130 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and all genotypes were visually checked by two independent investigators using GENEMAPPER 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems). To verify whether the observed variations were due to changes in mononucleotide repeats or to other mutation events, all size variants detected in this study were sequenced.
Analysis of haplotypes. Multilocus haplotypes were defined using GENALEX 6 (Peakall & Smouse 2006). To infer haplotypes relationships, we performed a factorial analysis based on a distance matrix between haplotypes using the Darwin software (version 5.0, Perrrier & Jacquemoud-Collet 2006). The established distance corresponds to the simple matching dissimilarity index for haploid data. A median joining network analysis was also computed with Network 4.5.6.1 (http://www.fluxusengineering.com.sharenet.htm). One-bp mutations were given a weight of one.
Both analyses suggested the existence of two divergent genepools associated to two geographical regions, the North western part of South America (with acces-
sions from Peru, Ecuador and South Columbia), and the Central ⁄ Caribbean part of America (with accessions from Mexico to North Columbia), thereafter referred to as Southern region and Northern region, respectively (Fig. 1). We realized an AMOVA with Arlequin software 3.1 (Excoffier et al. 2005) to test statistically this clearcut genetic structure. We recognized two groups, corresponding to accessions from the Southern and Northern regions, within each we classed geographical ‘‘populations’’ corresponding to groups of landraces from a given country.
The total number of cpSSR haplotypes and the number of private haplotypes were then calculated for each country and summarized over the Southern and the Northern regions, using GENALEX 6 (Peakall & Smouse 2006). To account for differences in sample size, rarefaction analysis of haplotype diversity was performed using CONTRIB (Petit et al. 1998), for countries from which more than five accessions were available.
Analysis with nuclear SSRs
Plant materials. About 130 accessions were selected from the previous sampling exercise to provide representative coverage of the sampling area and the two described chloroplast genepools (Fig. 1, Table 1).
Amplification and scoring. Thirteen nuclear microsatellites designed at the CIP (Solis et al. unpublished data) were selected for this study based on their reliable amplification profiles in Sequencer and their polymorphism (Table 3). The amplification protocol used was the same as that used for cpSSRs. Because nuclear SSR profiles are often difficult to read in this hexaploid species, all samples were genotyped at least twice.

  files that were not reproducible were counted as missing data. Genotyping was performed on an ABI 3130 sequencer, and all profiles were eye-checked by two independent investigators using GENEMAPPER 3.0 software.
For all analyses that required calculations of distances, our microsatellite data were coded in a binary manner similar to that used for AFLP data (0 = absence, 1 = presence of a given allele). Over all loci, 130 alleles were obtained; we thus used 130 binary variables.
Patterns of diversity. As sweet potato varieties are clonally propagated, we estimated the number of unique multilocus genotypes (MLGs), and then identified sets of clones. To identify clonal lineages, we followed the procedure described by Arnaud-Haond et al. (2007). We screened each MLG pair presenting extremely low genetic distances. These pairs accounted for a small peak (at very low values) in the frequency distribution of distances, making this distribution bimodal rather than unimodal. Darwin software was used to obtain the frequency distribution of pairwise distances between our 99 MLGs. Because our data set on this hexaploid species does not permit knowing exact allelic frequencies, the second step, estimating the likelihood that
slightly distinct MLGs were derived from distinct recombination events, was impossible. To compare the number of alleles among groups of different sizes, we used a rarefaction method (Petit et al. 1998; Vigouroux et al. 2008).The ‘R’ statistical software was used to calculate the average number of alleles for each locus in each group as the mean of 1000 re-samplings at the smallest group sample size (i.e. the number of plants assigned to the smallest group). Numbers of alleles per locus and per group were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with ‘R’.
Genetic structure as estimated using nuclear SSRs. First, we used a non-model-based algorithm which has already been successfully applied in phylogeographic studies based on AFLP (Burnier et al. 2009; Arrigo et al. 2010). Because this analysis does not allow missing data, our subsample was reduced to 101 accessions. Non-hierarchical K-means clustering (Hartigan & Wong 1979) was performed using R, running scripts developed by Arrigo et al. (2010) and kindly provided by the authors. This technique assigns individuals to a defined number of genetic groups (hereafter K) in order to maximize the intergroup variance, measured here as the inertia. We performed 100 000 independent runs (i.e.

starting from random points) for each assumed value of K (ranging between 1 and 10) and recorded the intergroup inertia of each run. We then explored the geographical composition of the genetic clusters from K = 2 to 10, corresponding to the replicate that maximizes the inter-group inertia.
A factorial analysis was performed with the software Darwin 5. A genetic distance matrix was obtained by averaging over all loci Sokal and Michener distances computed for each locus.
Mantel tests were also performed to compare the matrix of genetic distances (Sokal and Michener) between individual plants with a matrix of geographical distances calculated from latitude and longitude of each accession by DIVA-GIS 7.3 (Hijmans et al. 2004). The correlation was tested over the whole sampling area, as well as within the Southern and Northern region.
Results
Analysis of haplotypes
All loci harboured polymorphism, with a mean of 3.86 (±0.69) alleles per locus, resulting in an average haploid genetic diversity of 0.432 (±0.171) (Table 2). The sequences of the cpSSRs revealed that differences in length among the PCR products were due to differences in the number of mononucleotide repeats. No other length mutations, such as insertions or deletions, were detected in the sequenced accessions. In total, we identified 24 haplotypes (supplementary data Table S2, Supporting information), of which the five most common (H2, H6, H13, H14 and H16) occurred at frequencies of 0.09 to 0.23 and the 19 others at frequencies less than 0.03, while eight haplotypes were found only once.
Genetic relationships between haplotypes were first investigated by a factorial analysis. Sweet potato haplotypes formed two main clusters defined by the first axis (Fig. 2a), which explained 72.0% of the total variance; the second axis explained 7.8%. Each group was compact, with some outlying haplotypes (10–7, 8–4–5). We then used a network approach to improve our understanding of genetic relationships between different haplotypes. The minimum spanning tree distinguished two groups (Fig. 2b) similar to those revealed by the factorial analysis. These groups (groups 1 and 2) were separated from each other by several mutation events. Each group exhibited a star-like topology with rare and geographically restricted variants radiating from the most widely distributed and commonly occurring haplotypes. H10 and H21 were the only two haplotypes that clearly diverged from their respective parent groups by several mutation events. This tree organization supports the hypothesis of an ancient divergence between the
two main groups, within each of which recent diversification occurred by mutation events.
The distribution of haplotypes showed strong geographical structure. The Southern and Northern regions were differentiated on the basis of their haplotype compositions: group 1 haplotypes were mainly encountered in the Northern region, whereas group 2 haplotypes were predominant in the Southern region (Table 4). Notable exceptions to this clear-cut pattern concern specifically the most common haplotypes (Fig. 2b; Table 4), suggesting either long-distance dispersal events or misappropriation of samples to geographic region in passport data. The AMOVA analysis confirmed this genetic structure: a large part of the total molecular variance (35.27%, P < 0.0001) is attributed to the among regions variation, whereas the among populations within region variation accounts for 9.60% (P < 0.001). The maximum of diversity comes from within-region variation (55.3%, P < 0.001) illustrating the fact that what we defined as ‘‘populations’’ are heterogeneous, containing in particular haplotypes from both genetic groups.
The number of haplotypes per country ranged from 1 to 10 (mean 4). Sixteen haplotypes are found in the Northern region of which 7 are private. Fifteen are present in the Southern region of which 7 are private. The highest haplotype diversity (0.83) was found for Ecuadorian landraces and the lowest (0.61) for those from the Dominican Republic (Table 4). Peru and Columbia possess most of the private haplotypes.
Population structure revealed with nuclear SSRs
The hierarchical K-means clustering was run for 101 accessions (a subsample of unique multilocus genotypes with no missing data). For K = 2, the first group included 40 accessions, mainly accessions from the Southern region, but also including five from the Northern region. The second group was almost exclusively represented by 62 samples from the Northern region, including only six accessions from the Southern region (two from Ecuador, two from Peru and two from southern Columbia) (Fig. 3a and b). The composition of clusters for higher K values allows us to explore more subtle substructures. We found that, in general, accessions from the Southern region clearly clustered in two regional groups, the southern-Columbia ⁄ Ecuador group and the Peruvian group. In contrast, accessions from the Northern region were divided into different subgroups with accessions from distinct geographical areas.
Results of factorial analysis based on Sokal and Michener distance for the 130 subsamples were largely congruent with the non-hierarchical clustering for K = 2.
Ó 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

The two first axes explained only 15.8% of the total variance. The first axis distinguished accessions of the Southern region from those of the Northern one. The second axis distinguished Peruvian accessions from Ecuadorian-southern Colombian ones (Fig. 4). Geographical sub-structure of accessions from the Northern region was also not clearly characterized by the factorial analysis.
The correlation between genetic and geographic distances was significant for the entire sample (r = 0.212,
Comparison between genetic structures revealed by chloroplast and nuclear SSRs
Phylogeographic patterns revealed by chloroplast and nuclear data were globally congruent: Accessions from the Southern region were mainly associated with cp haplotype group 1 and nuclear cluster K1 (Fig. 4). Accessions from the Northern region were mainly of haplotype group 2 and nuclear cluster K2. Both kinds of markers supported the existence of two geographically restricted genepools. However, 24 accessions possessed group 1 haplotypes and nuclear diversity placing them in cluster K2. Most of these (19) originated

Pattern of nuclear SSR genetic diversity
Within the individuals genotyped with nuclear SSRs and without missing data, we found 101 unique multilocus genotypes. We detected six sets of two or three replicates of the same MLG per set. All replicates were locally restricted. Following the criteria of Arnaud-Haond et al. (2007), we identified seven clonal lineages that
probably correspond to groups of variants derived by somatic mutation. Most accessions from a given putative clonal lineage were quite restricted in distribution.
The rarefied allele number of the Northern region genepool was slightly higher than that of the Southern region genepool, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.55). Together, the Southern genepool exhibited 17 private alleles while the Northern one showed 27 (Table 5).
Discussion
The maintenance of ex situ collections of sweet potato is a laborious undertaking. Major concerns are the elimination of duplicates and the elaboration of a core collection. Our results provide tools for achieving these goals, permitting characterization of sweet potato genetic diversity. Previous studies, notably on potato, have demonstrated the importance for breeders of considering the cytoplasmic genetic base (Provan et al. 1999). In our case, cytoplasmic markers clearly revealed the existence of two different gene pools, which were less well discriminated by nuclear markers. It is entirely possible that different sets of functional genetic diversity may be contained in the two groups thus defined, underlining the importance for breeders of taking cytoplasmic markers into account.

Previous studies based on AFLP and RAPD markers had already suggested the existence of two distinct genepools in tropical America (Zhang et al. 2000; Gichuki et al. 2003), one associated with the Peru-Ecuador region and the other with the Caribbean and Central America. However, whereas these authors focused solely on the hypothesis of a single origin of domestication in the latter region, followed by dispersal to Peru and Ecuador, our results suggest the pertinence of considering the alternative hypothesis of independent domestications in Meso-America and in north-western South America. We here discuss these two scenarios for the origin of domesticated sweet potato.
Existence of two distinct genepools and the origin of cultivated sweet potatoes
Our conservative cpSSRs markers revealed that the divergence between the two haplotype groups is associated with numerous mutation events concerning various markers, supporting the idea that this divergence may be ancient. Because mutation model(s) and mutation rates of chloroplast microsatellites are not well understood, and furthermore are quite difficult to estimate with clonally reproducing organisms, they are not suitable markers for inferring demographic events, including estimation of the timing of divergence between the two groups identified in this study (Provan et al. 2001). However, the congruent and strong phylogeographic signal from both cpSSRs and nuclear SSRs supports the idea that this divergence may be associated with ancient geographical differentiation of wild
ancestral populations, predating sweet potato domestication.
Scenario 1: a single ancient origin. In the previous studies (Zhang et al. 2000; Gichuki et al. 2003), the hypothesis that domestication originated somewhere in the northern Neotropics (Caribbean, Central America or extreme northern South America) was favoured by the lower level of sweet potato genetic diversity found in the Peru-Ecuador gene pool, the absence of region-specific AFLP or RAPD profiles, and the greater diversity of wild Ipomoea species in Central America (Austin 1987). According to this hypothesis, the Peru-Ecuador group would have diverged from the northern genepool during dispersal, accompanied by reduction of diversity, and by adaptation driven by new environments and human selection.
Under such a scenario, domesticated plants exhibiting group 2 chloroplast haplotypes, subsequent to their diffusion into the Southern region, could have captured group 1 haplotypes from divergent local wild populations to obtain the observed pattern of chloroplast genetic diversity. Such putative wild ⁄ cultivated hybridization events must have occurred very early during the diffusion of sweet potato into the Southern area, as group 1 haplotypes strongly predominate in that region.
As a result of founder effects, it is likely that at least some loss of genetic diversity occurred during the expansion of sweet potato from a putative single domestication centre in Meso-America. Contradicting this expectation, we found no significant difference in

diversity between the Northern and Southern pools and detected region-specific alleles in both groups, appearing with frequencies <0.2. The opposite scenario, with initial domestication in South America and diffusion into Caribbean-Central America, is therefore equally plausible. In either case, gene flow from multiple hybridization events with local wild populations could have maintained and ⁄ or enhanced allelic diversity. The existence of two haplotypes, H10 and H21, very distant from the common ones, indicates that wild ⁄ cultivated gene flow probably occurred. Such interspecific hybridization has already been recorded in natural conditions (Austin 1977, 1987) and has been used in sweet potato genetic improvement (Shiotani et al. 1990; Orjeda et al. 1991). However, incompatibility among species and the low yield of storage roots in such crosses (Shiotani et al. 1990) may limit the selection of such hybrids by farmers.
Scenario 2: Multiple domestication events in space and time. The great divergence we have documented between the Northern and Southern genepools could alternatively be the result of two independent events of domestication, either of a single widely distributed, geographically differentiated species, or of different Ipomoea species in each region. Numerous genetic, phylogenetic and cytogenetic studies have established that diploid I. trifida is the closest relative to I. batatas, but have failed to determine precisely if it was the only genome involved in the formation of the hexaploid sweet potato. In addition, the taxonomy of I. trifida is quite debated. Diploid I. trifida occurs in lowlands (sea level to 1000 m) from Mexico to Caribbean South America (northern Colombia and Venezuela). The distribution of this species in the lowlands of north-western South America (southern Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru) is poorly documented; only three specimens from this region (collected from both sides of the Andes) have been referred to this species (http://www.tropicos.org). For over 50 years, there has been interest in tetraploid specimens discovered in Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico (Bohac et al. 1993). After taxonomic evaluation, it appeared that many of these are wild tetraploid I. batatas (Bohac et al. 1993). These results have raised the possibility that I. batatas also exists as a wild species, widely distributed from Mexico to Ecuador. If this is so, cultivated forms could have been domesticated directly from this wild tetraploid ancestor, perhaps through hybridization with other related wild species (Bohac et al. 1993).
If different Ipomoea species were involved in the formation of these two cultivated groups, we expected from our nuclear data to detect a multimodal distribution of allelic size range. Because nuclear microsatellite
loci often evolve following a stepwise mutation model, alleles from divergent species are expected to differ in their size ranges. Problems of amplification and numerous null alleles would also not be surprising in this case. The relative homogeneity in distribution of allele size range for each group and the presence, in each group, of accessions with at least five alleles for each of 10 out of the 13 loci examined, indicate that more probably one species, widely distributed and exhibiting geographical differentiation from Central to South America, was domesticated. If more than one species was involved, these must have been very closely related.
Numerous cpSSR haplotypes were present within each group. In particular, within both Northern and Southern groups, we obtained more than one common and widely distributed haplotype. In interpreting gene genealogies, such haplotypes are considered ancestral (Posada & Crandall 2001). The presence of two such haplotypes is consistent with multiple domestications within an ancestrally polymorphic wild population, as has been proposed for Phaseolus vulgaris (Chaco ́n et al. 2005). Alternatively, early in the process of diffusion, domesticated sweet potatoes may have captured chloroplasts from related wild populations in regions where the crop was introduced, as discussed above in treatment of scenario 1. Finally, mutations may have occurred post-domestication, although this would imply surprisingly rapid evolution at cpSSR loci.
Sweet potato is an ancient crop in Peru (Ugent & Peterson 1988; Zhang et al. 2000). The oldest remains of dried sweet potatoes, 8000 years old, originate from the caves of Chilca Canyon in Peru and roots have also been found in other more recent coastal Peruvian archaeological sites (Ugent & Peterson 1988). No ancient remains have been reported in Central American sites. These archaeological data confirm sweet potato as one of the oldest domesticates in the Americas, domestication having occurred more than 8000 years ago, and likely first in South America, as already suggested for common bean (Chaco ́ n et al. 2005).
Although this second scenario appears more parsimonious than the first, the apparent lack of morphological divergence between Central American ⁄ Caribbean and South American sweet potato landraces raises questions. In crops known to have been domesticated two or more times independently from different wild pools, morphological differentiation is expected, because the different origins are usually associated with independent mutations favoured by selection (Allaby et al. 2008) that lead to different phenotypic traits. No subspecies, botanical varieties or varietal groups of sweet potato corresponding to the two gene pools we identified have so far been reported in the literature. On the other hand, there exists no comprehensive, statistically

supported phenotypic analysis of New World sweet potato landraces. The morphological descriptors classically used to characterize sweet potato landraces are highly variable within each of the two groups. However, these descriptors concern traits that should be under diversifying human selection. Great variation within groups in traits such as leaf shape and the shape and colour of tuberous roots, as well as high overlap between the two groups, are thus not surprising. Stable characters used by taxonomists to differentiate species in Ipomoea series Batatas concern floral traits, in particular sepal and corolla shapes and sepal size (Bohac et al. 2003). Such traits are often absent from lists of morphological descriptors analysed in sweet potato landraces, but they may offer the best chance to detect eventual differences between South American and Central American ⁄ Caribbean landraces.
Finally, when available molecular, archaeological, morphological and taxonomic evidence are all taken into account, we postulate that at least two domestication events occurred for sweet potato, one in the lowlands of north-western South America, and one in the lowlands of the Central America ⁄ Caribbean region. Sweet potato then diffused from these areas of origin throughout tropical America.
If this scenario is supported by further tests, sweet potato would join other American crop species for which evidence suggests multiple independent domestication events. Diamond (1997) postulated that geography may have made independent domestication events of the same plant particularly likely in the New World. According to his hypothesis, the demographic (and sometimes military) advantages conferred by agriculture allowed early farming peoples to expand their ranges, carrying their domesticated plants with them. This process would have been slower in the Americas, oriented north–south, than in Eurasia, oriented east– west: people and crops crossing latitudes encounter greater environmental barriers than do people and crops moving with longitude (Diamond 1997). There thus was more time for independent domestication in northern and southern centers. Taro (Colocasia esculenta L.) offers a possible example from the Old World. Based on AFLP results, it has been proposed that this plant was domesticated at least twice, once in South-east Asia and once in the Pacific (Kreike et al. 2004). Here, insular isolation may have contributed to facilitating independent domestication.
Dispersal and diversification processes
From both of its putative areas of origin, sweet potato diffused broadly within and among regions long before the arrival of Europeans, as attested to by the wide dis-
tribution of common and probably ancestral haplotypes throughout the area sampled.
We identified six sets of clones with two or three replicates per set and also detected seven clonal lineages with two or three accessions per lineage. Most of the clone sets and clonal lineages were restricted to a single site or to sites in close geographic proximity. Comparing phylogeographic signals given by chloroplast and nuclear markers in the Northern region, we found very few accessions for which both types of markers indicated a Southern origin (i.e., group 1 haplotype, nuclear cluster 1). Similarly, in the Southern region, we found very few accessions for which both markers indicated a Northern origin (i.e., group 2 haplotype, nuclear cluster 2). In each region, most accessions that possessed ‘foreign’ haplotypes belonged to the nuclear cluster typical of their respective areas. This indicates that recombination between migrant clones and local material likely occurs. Patterns of differentiation observed with nuclear data also indicate recombination between the two populations. Genetic differentiation at nuclear loci is less pronounced than that revealed by cpSSRs, while the phylogeographic signal still remains very strong. This pattern is probably due to admixture between the two initial domesticated gene pools. 87% of accessions displayed pairwise genetic distances high enough (>0.2) to consider that they were likely to have been derived from independent recombination events rather than from somaclonal diversification (Arnaud-Haond et al. 2007). The incorporation of true seedlings issued from sexual reproduction has been reported in sweet potato landrace populations in Oceania (Yen 1974), but its importance for diversification of American landraces has not been studied. Our data show that most of the genetic diversity we document cannot be accounted for by strictly clonal evolution, strongly suggesting the importance of mixed clonal ⁄ sexual reproduction via the incorporation of true seedlings as new clones, as in other clonally propagated domesticated plants (Elias et al. 2001; Caillon et al. 2006; McKey et al. 2010). The seedlings farmers incorporated may in some cases have been wild ⁄ domesticated hybrids, accounting for the gene flow from wild to domesticated taxa suggested by our data.
The significant correlation between geographical and nuclear genetic distance observed within both the Southern and Northern regions probably reflects progressive expansion of the crop within each region. Within the Southern region, there was greater subregional differentiation and a stronger pattern of isolation by distance than in the Northern region, possibly indicating greater barriers to gene flow within the Southern region.
In most clonally propagated crops, sexual reproduction has played a major role in evolution under domes-

tication (Pickersgill 2007). The widespread notion of ‘single-step domestication’ of these crops by capture and multiplication of mutant clones appears to be untenable (McKey et al. 2010). Domestication probably occurred over a period of time, and perhaps in more than one location throughout the vast geographical ranges of most crop plants’ wild ancestors. In fact, the domestication process is still being practiced by farmers who capture attractive volunteer genotypes appearing spontaneously and multiply them as new clones. Different varieties of these crops exchange genes, and gene flow occurs between cultivated forms and wild taxa, or between cultivated forms and feral plants escaped from cultivation and surviving in the wild (Lebot 2009). Our results support such scenarios for sweet potato domestication and diversification in the Americas. We propose that sweet potato was probably domesticated at least two times, once in the lowlands of north-western South America, and once in the lowlands of Central America or the Caribbean rim. Domestication may even have occurred more than once within one or both regions. Sweet potato was then dispersed across tropical America. In the long run, social exchange of clones, somatic mutation, local recombination, and gene flow between wild and cultivated forms have contributed to shape the large number of landraces recorded in the Americas.
