The performance of an organism’s feeding apparatus has obvious implications for its fitness and survival. However, the majority of studies that focus on chondrichthyan feeding have largely ignored the role of teeth. Studying the functional morphology of shark teeth not only elucidates the biological role that teeth play in feeding, but also provides insight specifically into the evolution of shark feeding because teeth are often the only structures available in the fossil record. In the present study, we investigate the puncture and draw performance of three general categories of extant teeth, tearing-type, cutting-type, and cutting–clutching type, as well as three fossil morphologies, utilizing a universal testing system. Differences in puncturing performance occurred among different prey items, indicating that not all ‘soft’ prey items are alike. The majority of teeth were able to puncture different prey items, and differences in puncture performance also occurred among tooth types; however, few patterns emerged. In some cases, broader triangular teeth were less effective at puncturing than narrow-cusped teeth. There were no differences between the maximum draw forces and maximum puncture forces. Many of the shark teeth in the present study were not only able to perform draw and puncture equally well, but also many tooth morphologies were functionally equivalent to each other. The findings obtained in the present study lend little support to the belief that shark tooth morphology is a good predictor of biological role. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 100, 271–286.

  INTRODUCTION
Measuring the effects, or lack thereof, of morphology on performance, and performance on fitness, is necessary to gain a full picture of selection, adaptation, ecology, and evolution (Bock, 1980; Arnold, 1983; Wainwright, 1996). The performance of an organism’s feeding apparatus has obvious implications for its fitness and survival. In this vein, a number of recent studies of vertebrate functional morphology have specifically addressed feeding (Biknevicius, Van Valkenburgh & Walker, 1996; Deufel & Cundall, 1999; Schwenk, 2000; Dumont, Piccirillo & Grosse, 2005; Jones, 2008). Although studies of the functional morphology of feeding in extant fishes have concerned
osteichthyans (Lauder, 1980; Bemis & Lauder, 1986; Wainwright, 1988; Dutta, 1992; Konow & Sanford, 2008;), there are a growing number that focus on chondrichthyans (Springer, 1961; Moss, 1977; Frazzetta, 1994; Motta, 2004; Motta et al., 2008;). However, the majority of studies on elasmobranchs concern muscle function and the movement of cranial components, whereas the role of teeth has largely been ignored, despite the fact that they are instrumental in prey procurement and processing; but see also Ramsay & Wilga (2007) and Dean, Ramsay & Schaefer (2008). Studying the functional morphology of shark teeth not only elucidates the biological role that teeth play in feeding, but also provides insight specifically into the evolution of shark feeding because teeth are often the only structures available in the fossil record (Carroll, 1988).

 SHARK TOOTH FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY
Tooth function has been explored in a number of vertebrates; however, the majority of studies have been performed on mammals (Churcher, 1985; Van Valkenburgh & Ruff, 1987; Lucas, Peters & Arrendale, 1994; Freeman & Weins, 1997; Evans & Sanson, 1998; Evans et al., 2007; Freeman & Lemen, 2007). Comparatively few studies exist for shark teeth (Nobiling, 1977; Frazzetta, 1988; Powlik, 1995; Ramsay & Wilga, 2007; Dean et al., 2008). Frazzetta (1988) was the first to specifically address the biomechanics of cutting in shark teeth and its relation to form. Applying artificial blades and teeth from various shark species to compliant materials, he observed that smooth, slender teeth, such as those of the mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus, appeared better suited for puncturing and piercing. Serrated teeth, such as those of the white shark Carcharodon carcharias, appeared to be more useful for slicing and cutting, although they are more susceptible to binding of the teeth in prey than the smooth, nonserrated teeth. Abler (1992) qualitatively tested three hypotheses about the mechanics of cutting for smooth and serrated teeth and found that serrated blades trap material between serrations and thus rip tissues as they are carried by the tooth. He also stated that smooth blades concentrate a large force on the cutting edge, creating high pressure that ‘crushes’ the material beneath it, producing the cut. More recent studies focus on reorientation of teeth during feeding and their dual roles in gripping and either crushing or protecting the jaw as it hits the seafloor (battering) (Ramsay & Wilga, 2007; Dean et al., 2008).
Elasmobranch teeth are often ascribed qualitative functions without any biomechanical testing (Cappetta, 1986; Cappetta, 1987; Motta, 2004). Small teeth, often with lateral cusplets, are typically characterized as ‘clutching-type’. These are found within the Orectolobidae, Ginglymostomidae, Squatinidae, and Scyliorhinidae. ‘Tearing-type’ teeth, which are considered to function best in puncture, have narrow, tall cusps and are usually not serrated; examples include teeth of the lamniforms Isurus and Mitsukurina. Teeth whose crowns are lingo-labially flattened and widen towards the base are ‘cutting-type’; many of the Carcharhinidae fall into this category. Molariform teeth, such as those found in the heterodontids and many batoids, fall into ‘crushing-type’ or ‘grinding-type’ (Moss, 1977; Cappetta, 1987; Frazzetta, 1988). These morphotypes are by no means exclusive. For example, Heterodontus have clutching teeth anteriorly and crushing teeth posteriorly (Cappetta, 1987).
Fossil sharks have also exhibited a wide diversity of tooth morphologies, many of which are not found in
extant forms. Given the abundance of teeth in the fossil record and the paucity of skeletal remains, tooth morphology has been used to divide sharks into different evolutionary levels: cladodont, hybodont, and modern (Schaeffer, 1967). These are also supported by other characteristics when preserved, such as jaw and fin structure, although these levels reflect general trends and do not imply specific evolutionary relationships (Schaeffer, 1967; Zangerl, 1981). The cladodont level represents the earliest sharks, found mainly from the Middle Devonian (391 Mya) to the Pennsylvanian (323 Mya). This morphology has a large medial cusp with numerous lateral cusplets on each side, with a flattened disk-like base (Schaeffer, 1967). Schaeffer also includes the xenacanth tooth morphology in this level, although it does not appear until the Mississippian and has a very different morphology (Schaeffer, 1967; Benton, 1997). The medial cusp is the smallest, with larger lateral cusps on each side and, in some species, cusps are serrated (Schaeffer, 1967). The hybodont level sharks may have existed as early as the Devonian, but were the dominant group from the Triassic (248 Mya) to the Jurassic (206 Mya) (Schaeffer, 1967; Maisey, 1982). The tooth morphology of hybodont level sharks is much less generalized than those of the cladodont level. Tooth morphology is either multicusped, although in a less dramatic fashion than the cladodonts, or molarlike. The medial cusp in the multicusped teeth varies in height from much taller to almost the same height as the lateral cusplets (Cappetta, 1987). Lastly, the modern level elasmobranchs first appear in the late Paleozoic and became the dominant group during the Cretaceous (165–144 Mya) (Benton, 1997).
As with extant sharks, the same tendency to predict function from tooth morphology exists for fossil chondrichthyan teeth (Peyer, 1968; Cappetta, 1987; Cicimurri, 2000; Cicimurri, 2004; Stahl & Parris, 2004). For example, the Jurassic hybodont shark Sphendous has high crowned teeth and has been hypothesized to eat soft-bodied invertebrate (Cappetta, 1987). Direct and indirect evidence, in the form of preserved gut contents and trace fossils on potential prey items, suggests that cladodont teeth were suited for puncturing soft-bodied prey, as well as hard prey such as ammonites (Mapes & Hansen, 1984; Williams, 1990; Mapes, Sims & Boardmann II, 1995). Despite the fact that extant and fossil shark teeth encompass a wide variety of shapes and perform a variety of biological functions, performance testing has never been applied to them.
GOALS
In the present study, we investigated the performance of three general categories of extant teeth, tearing-

type, cutting-type, and cutting–clutching, as well as three fossil morphologies, aiming to address the putative relationship between form, performance, and function for shark teeth. The specific goals of the study are to: (1) determine the forces necessary for individual teeth to penetrate a variety of fish and crustacean prey representative of shark diets; (2) determine what differences in penetration force, maximum force, and energy to puncture (efficiency) occur among tooth types; (3) compare performance between different cutting regimes for a given tooth morphology; and (4) determine which morphological aspects, if any, of tooth shape are predictive of tooth performance. Here, we report the results of performance testing of teeth in puncture and unidirectional draw for ten species of extant shark and three extinct shark clades. These results also have implications for studies of fossil chondrichthyans, where, typically, tooth morphology is used to predict feeding ecology and biological role in the absence of behavioural data (Peyer, 1968; Zangerl, 1981; Lund, 1985; Lund, 1990; Whitenack, Elliott & Brandenburg, 2002; Elliott et al., 2004).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
SPECIMENS FOR PERFORMANCE TESTING
Teeth from ten shark species were chosen to cover a wide range of extant tooth forms, as opposed to taxonomy: I. oxyrinchus (Rafinesque, 1810), C. carcharias (Linnaeus, 1758), Sphyrna mokarran (Rüppell, 1837), Galeocerdo cuvier (Müller and Henle, 1837), Carcharhinus leucas (Müller and Henle, 1839), Carcharhinus limbatus (Müller and Henle, 1839), Negaprion brevirostris (Poey, 1868), Prionace glauca (Linnaeus, 1758), Scymnodon ringens (Barbosa du Bocage and Brito Capello, 1864), and Hexanchus griseus (Bonnaterre, 1788) (Figs 1, 2, Table 1). Teeth of these species can be grouped in two general categories: tearing and cutting morphs, sensu Cappetta (1987). Tearing teeth are described as has having narrow cusps with distinct cutting edges (e.g. the anterior teeth of I. oxyrinchus). Cutting teeth can be further divided into two subtypes: the ‘cutting’ subtype and the ‘cutting–clutching’ subtype, sensu Cappetta (1987). Teeth that are lingo-labially flattened, often serrated, and posses broad cusps distally inclined toward the back of the jaw are considered to fall under the ‘cutting’ subtype; C. carcharias, G. cuvier, H. griseus, C. leucas, P. glauca, S. mokarran, and the lateral teeth of I. oxyrinchus are members of this subtype. In the ‘cutting–clutching’ subtype, teeth of either the upper or lower jaw are wide and lingolabially flattened and those of the opposing jaw have high and narrow cusps. Carcharhinus limbatus, S.

ringens, and N. brevirostris belong in this category. It should be noted that the original classification of Cappetta (1987) for this subtype confounds dignathic heterodonty and tooth morphology. For the present study, the C. limbatus and S. ringens teeth are part of the ‘cutting’ jaw, whereas teeth of N. brevirostris are part of the ‘cutting–clutching’ jaw. It should be noted that the ‘cutting–clutching’ teeth of N. brevirostris are not of the same morphology as those of the small, multicusped ‘clutching-type’ exemplified by many of the Scyliorhinidae (Cappetta, 1987).
From each species, except as noted in Table 1, single teeth from three sexually mature individuals were removed from the jaw and air dried. Teeth were removed from the row lingual to the functional row (second row) to ensure that teeth were not worn and therefore optimally sharp prior to performance testing. Single teeth from three fossil clades, representing basic fossil morphologies that are not seen in the modern sharks, were used: cladodont (Cladodus sp.,

three-dimensional geometry from stacked Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images acquired by the computed tomography scanner. Each STL was then imported into Geomagic Studio 6 (Geomagic Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC, USA), which was used to rebuild parts of the fossil teeth, as all three specimens were partially damaged by taphonomic processes. The modified tooth models were then created from a plaster-based powder using a threedimensional Zprinter 310 for rapid prototyping (Z Corporation) and used to make aluminum casts. Sharp cusp apices were added back to X. compressus and Cladodus sp. and cutting edges to X. compressus and Hybodus sp. with a rotary tool and fine sandpaper, based on reconstructions in Cappetta (1987) and Zangerl (1981). The fossil casts and extant teeth were potted in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) couplers with Labstone dental cement (Heraeus Kulzer Inc.), and then mounted to a MTS 858 MiniBionix II universal testing system (Eden Prairie).
PERFORMANCE TESTING
Tooth performance was tested by puncture and unidirectional draw. Puncture occurs when a tooth enters orthogonally to the prey item such as during biting. Unidirectional draw assumes the tooth has already entered the prey, and involves lateral movement

through tissue and may occur, for instance, during head shaking behaviour.
For puncture, teeth were tested on five prey items representing a variety of scale thicknesses and toughness: teleosts with thick scales [sheepshead, Archosargus probatocephalus (Walbaum, 1792), total length (TL) = 27.9–39.4 cm, mean ± SD scale thickness = 0.185 ± 0.038 mm], with scales of intermediate thickness [white grunt, Haemulon plumieri (Lacepède, 1801), TL = 20.3–34.9 cm, mean ± SD scale thickness = 0.121 ± 0.048 mm], and with thin scales [ladyfish, Elops saurus (Linnaeus, 1766), TL = 29.8– 48.3 cm, mean ± SD scale thickness = 0.058 ± 0.014 mm], an elasmobranch [bonnethead, Sphyrna tiburo (Linnaeus, 1758), TL = 58.8–74.8 cm], and a crustacean [blue crab, Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896), inter-molt crabs only, carapace spine-to-spine width = 13.7–19.1 cm]. These prey items were chosen to represent prey items with a range of biomechanical properties, rather than inclusion in all shark diets, although most of the sharks included in the study eat a variety of teleost prey items (Compagno, 1984a, b; Cortes, 1999). All prey items were stored frozen and thawed immediately before testing. Prey items were placed on a wooden stage lined with sandpaper to prevent the prey item from slipping during tests. The stage rested upon a 5-kN load cell to obtain force magnitudes that occur during puncture. Teeth were positioned with the cusp apex contacting the prey item. For the vertebrate prey, teeth were tested on the epaxialis musculature to avoid the vertebral column and the proximal pterygiophores. Individual prey items were used for multiple punctures at different locations. For crustacean prey, teeth were positioned at the centre of the dorsal carapace. Individual crabs were only used once.
For each puncture trial, teeth were driven into the prey item at a rate of 400 mm s-1. This upper limit of the MTS system approximates the rate of movement of the upper jaw of carcharhinid sharks during prey capture (460 mm s-1) (P. J. Motta & D. Lowry, unpubl. data). Tooth displacements, the vertical distance moved by the tooth during the test, were set minimally to the length of the cusp. Two prey items, E. saurus and S. tiburo, deformed greatly before tooth penetration, necessitating displacements to be set to values greater than cusp length. A high speed Redlake PCI 500 or 1000 Motionscope digital video camera at 500 fields s-1 allowed synchronization of initial penetration of the tooth and the force as recorded by the MTS. Three trials were recorded for each tooth for each prey item. From each puncture trial, force at initial puncture (Fp) and maximum puncture force (Fmax) were measured. Energy to puncture (Ep) was calculated from the area under the force-displacement curve as a measure of efficiency.
For unidirectional draw, only one prey item, H. plumieri (TL = 21.0–25.4 cm) was used. One side of the fish was adhered to a wood stage by cyanoacrylate glue. The stage was mounted into the MTS such that the mounted teeth were positioned with the basal axis of the tooth parallel to the antero-posterior axis of the fish. This made the apico-basal axis perpendicular to the fish surface, although this did not guarantee the apex of the tooth to be orthogonal to the prey (i.e. teeth of G. cuvier). The PVC coupler housing the teeth was in turn mounted to the 5-kN load cell. The cusp of each tooth was then completely embedded in the epaxialis musculature. Teeth then sliced through the prey item, using the distal cutting edge of the tooth, at a velocity of400mms-1for30mm.Anewfishwasusedforeach draw. For each trial, the maximum force that occurred during the draw event was recorded (Fdraw). Subsequent to the draw trials, for a subsample of H. plumieri (N = 11) the area surrounding the cut was skinned to determine the number of myosepta cut by the shark teeth. The number of cut myosepta was compared with the number of peaks in the force-displacement trace from the corresponding draw trial. One draw trial was run for each tooth as a result of the availability of specimens; therefore, means were taken for each species and used in subsequent statistical analyses.
TOOTH MORPHOMETRICS
To quantify tooth morphology, a series of tooth shape measurements was taken from five teeth from the labial-most row from five jaws of adult sharks for each species. Teeth chosen for measurements were from the same region of the jaw as those used in performance testing. Only teeth from the right side of each jaw were used to account for any fluctuating asymmetry in tooth shape. The measurements taken, based in part on Shimada (2005) and on characters previously cited to be related to tooth function (Fig. 3), were: base-cusp width (BCW; maximum cusp width), cusp height (CH; perpendicular from cusp apex to BCW), mesial cutting edge length (MCL; distance between cusp apex and most mesial point of BCW), and distal cutting edge (DCL; distance between cusp apex and most distal point of BCW). From these measurements, two ratios were calculated and used in subsequent analyses: cusp aspect ratio (CAR; CH/BCW) and cusp inclination (CI; MCL/DCL). In addition to the ratios, the following measurements were also used in the analyses: base overlap (BO; distance of either base overlap (+) or between bases (-) of adjacent tooth divided by the mean of BW for both bases), notch angle (NA; angle taken from cusp apex to notch to most distal point of BCW), and cusplet angle (CA; angle taken from cusp apex to notch to apex of lateral cusplets when present, CA = 0 if no cusplets present). Other aspects of

(tearing, cutting, cutting–clutching) differed in performance, the above analyses were repeated with morphotype and prey as factors for the MANOVA, followed by one-way ANOVAs to explore differences among morphotypes within prey items. Differences in draw performance (Fdraw) among species and among morphotypes were assessed using one-way ANOVAs and post-hoc Tukey’s HSD tests. Paired t-tests were then used to determine whether teeth differed in puncture (Fp, Fmax) and draw performance (Fdraw). For all tests, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MANOVA was performed using SYSTAT 11 (Systat Software Inc.); all other statistical tests were performed using SigmaStat 3.1 (Systat Software Inc.).
Despite the fact that tooth morphology was not chosen based on taxonomy or evolutionary relationships, it is possible that the performance of different teeth is related to phylogeny. Simple exact Mantel tests were used to determine whether dissimilarity matrices of Fp, Fmax, and Ep for each prey item and Fdraw were correlated with a dissimilarity matrix based on phylogenetic distance. Distances were obtained from a composite tree based on the literature (Fig.1) (Compagno, 1988; Martin, Naylor & Palumbi, 1992; Shirai, 1996; Grogan & Lund, 2004). Branch lengths were set to the first appearance of each extant species in the fossil record, although this underestimates divergence times, or to the age of the fossil tooth (first appearance data; Cappetta, 1987; Long, 1993; Cigala-Fulgosi, 1995; Iturralde-vinent, Hubbell & Rojas, 1996; Purdy, 1996; Yabe, 1998; Rana et al., 2006). P < 0.05 was considered statistically different for all tests. Mantel tests were performed with ZT software (Bonnet & Van de Peer, 2002) (http:// www.psb.ugent.be/~erbon/mantel/).
Lastly, canonical correlates analysis (CCA) was used to examine the relationship between tooth morphometric and performance variables. Because of problems with colinearity, two separate CCAs were run. The first encompassed performance variables from puncture testing on H. plumieri (Fp Fmax, and Ep) and morphometric variables CAR, CI, NA, CA, BO, LAT, LC, and SE. The second CCA used Fdraw and Fp from H. plumieri and CAR, CI, NA, BO, and SE. CA, LAT, and LC all had the same values for the species that were capable of draw and therefore could not be included in the second CCA. CCAs were performed with SYSTAT 11. All procedures were in accordance with University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number T2893).

tooth shape were quantified as discrete states: number of lateral cusplets (LAT), lingual-labial cusp curvature (LC; 0 = straight cusp, 1 = curved lingually, 2 = recurved labially), and degree of serration [SE; 0 = none, 1 = weakly serrated (visible under a dissecting microscope), 2 = strongly serrated (visible to the naked eye)].
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
To determine whether differences in puncture performance existed among teeth (species), means for force and energy values for each tooth within each prey item were taken, and compared using a two factor multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), with prey types and teeth (species) as factors and individuals as replicates. Factors identified as significant were further assessed with two-way univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and Holm–Sidak multiple comparison post-hoc tests. Analysis of interactions was not possible as a result of missing data from teeth that would not puncture; therefore, to address differences within prey items and among teeth, one-way ANOVAs were performed for each prey item with Holm–Sidak multiple comparison or Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests. For each set of statistical tests, the following were logtransformed for normality: all puncture variables for H. plumieri, and Fp and Ep for C. sapidus. For those variables that either would not normalize or did not have equal variance (all puncture variables for E. saurus, Fmax for A. probatocephalus, S. tiburo and C. sapidus), nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were run.

force-displacement traces for a puncture are shown in Figure 4. Additional force-displacement traces of performance testing data have been deposited at http://datadryad.org/repo. All puncture performance variables were significant for both tooth and prey factors (MANOVA, Wilks’ lambda = 0.061, P < 0.001). Two-way ANOVAs on each of the puncture variables revealed differences in both tooth and prey factors for all variables (P < 0.001) (Table 5). For both Fp and Fmax, the lowest forces were recorded during puncture of ladyfish E. saurus, whereas the highest forces occurred during puncture of blue crab C. sapidus (Tables 2, 3, 5). Although both Fp and Fmax were lower for the white grunt H. plumieri than for the thickscaled sheepshead A. probatocephalus, neither were different from the bonnethead S. tiburo for Fp. Puncturing the S. tiburo only differed from A. probatocephalus for Fmax, with lower magnitudes for S. tiburo (Tables 2, 3). Elops saurus had lower Ep than all prey items except H. plumieri, and only A. probatocephalus was greater than H. plumieri for Ep (Tables 4, 5). No other differences in Ep were found.
Significant differences also occurred among teeth pooled across prey items, though no major pattern emerged (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). Fp for Cladodus sp., X. compressus, and C. carcharias were greater than those

puncture variables showed significant differences between C. carcharias and other teeth. For Fp, C. carcharias was higher than that of C. limbatus, Hybodus sp., and the anterior tooth of I. oxyrinchus. Carcharodon carcharias Fmax on H. plumieri was higher than that of Hybodus sp., both I. oxyrinchus teeth, and N. brevirostris. Lastly, Ep for C. carcharias was greater than that of C. limbatus and the anterior tooth of I. oxyrinchus. When grouped by tooth morphotype, all puncture performance variables were significant for both morphotype and prey factors (MANOVA, Wilks’ lambda = 0.163, P < 0.001). However, one-way ANOVAs found no differences among the morphotypes for Fp on H. plumieri or any of the puncture variables for E. saurus, S. tiburo, and C. sapidus. The cutting subtype had higher Fmax and Ep than the cutting– clutching subtype on H. plumieri, and all performance variables on A. probatocephalus were higher for the cutting subtype than the cutting–clutching subtype.
UNIDIRECTIONAL DRAW
For all teeth with successful draw tests, Fdraw was significantly higher than force at initial puncture Fp (t8 = -4.891, P = 0.001), but was not different from Fmax of puncture (t8 = 0.821, P = 0.433) (Table 7). Differences in Fdraw existed among tooth types (F8,18 = 2.258, P = 0.018); however, the only post-hoc difference found was that Cladodus sp. was higher than both G. cuvier and S. mokarran. No difference among morphotypes was found (F1,6 = 0.068, P = 0.803). A representative force-displacement trace may be found in Figure 4. Out of the 11 H. plumieri examined post-draw, the number of myosepta cut matched the number of peaks on the forcedisplacement trace for 54.5% of the specimens, 18.2% differed by one, and 27.3% did not match at all.
PHYLOGENETIC AND MORPHOMETRIC RELATIONSHIPS
Performance is not related to phylogeny for the species tested in the present study because there was no apparent phylogenetic signal in the data. Mantel tests did not show any correlation between phylogenetic distance and any of the performance variables (P > 0.05 in all cases). Similarly, there is little correlation between shape and performance. The first CCA (incorporating Fp, Fmax, and Ep) indicated no correlation of puncture variables with shape or serrated versus nonserrated edges; no significant axes were produced by this analysis (P > 0.05). The second CCA (incorporating only Fdraw and Fp) showed no relationship between tooth shape and draw performance. However, this CCA had one significant axis with Fp, SE, and NA loading positively on this axis, whereas CAR loaded negatively (Bartlett’s c2 = 19.03, d.f. = 10, P = 0.04). As

Within prey items, significant differences among teeth occurred, although there was no consistent pattern (Tables 2, 3, 4, 6). No significant differences among teeth were found for any puncture variables for E. saurus or C. sapidus, nor were there differences in Fp or Fmax within A. probatocephalus or S. tiburo. For the latter prey items, Ep for Cladodus sp. was greater than that of C. carcharias, C. limbatus, N. brevirostris and both I. oxyrinchus teeth (Tables 4, 6). Additionally, for A. probatocephalus, Ep for Cladodus sp. was greater than S. ringens, and C. leucas was greater than N. brevirostris. For S. tiburo, Ep for Cladodus sp. was greater than C. leucas.

spective, prey are often categorized into two groups: ‘hard’ prey, such as echinoderms, crustaceans, and shelled mollusks, and ‘soft’ prey (everything else) (Wainwright, 1988; Waller & Baranes, 1991; Turingan, 1994; Dean, Bizzarro & Summers, 2007; Ramsay & Wilga, 2007; Huber et al., 2009). In terms of tooth biomechanics, this analysis questions this dichotomy, revealing that not all ‘soft’ prey are alike. Even within a general prey type, such as ‘teleosts’, significant differences in puncture forces were found. Among teleosts, the thin-scaled E. saurus required the lowest Fp, Fmax, and Ep, whereas the thick-scaled A. probatocephalus required the highest. This implies that not only does it generally take less force to puncture E. saurus, but also less energy must be expended by the shark to do so. In addition, some teeth were able to penetrate some teleosts and not others. For example, under these test conditions, teeth from the blue shark P. glauca could not puncture E. saurus or A. probatocephalus, but were able to penetrate H. plumieri, indicating that differences among prey items affect the function of some teeth.
The thickness of the scales and skin, myoseptal arrangement, and muscle composition all likely play a role in how much force is required to puncture a particular teleost. Skin thickness has been shown to influence skin strength in teleosts (Hebrank & Hebrank, 1986), mammals (Freeman & Lemen, 2007), and penetration forces of knives into artificial skin (Gilchrist et al., 2008). Differences in skin architec-
   cusps became broader (CAR decreases), the degree of serration increased, and notch angle became less acute the force to initial puncture increased.
DISCUSSION
BIOMECHANICS OF PREY ITEMS
Differences in puncturing performance occurred among different prey items. From a functional per-

ture and stiffness in the bodies of prey items may contribute to the differing tooth puncture results both within and among the ‘soft’ prey items. Skin tension is directly related to both the force and energy of knife penetration during stabbing (Gilchrist et al., 2008). Cross-helically wound collagen fibres contribute directly to skin stiffness in both teleosts and elasmobranchs; the number of collagen fibre layers varies among fishes and between sexes of some sharks (Motta, 1977; Hebrank, 1980; Hebrank & Hebrank, 1986; Pratt & Carrier, 2001). Similarly, strength and stiffness have been shown to be correlated with the amount and orientation of collagen fibres in mammalian skin (Flint et al., 1984; Vogel, 1988).
In general, it has been assumed that shark skin is stiffer because, for a given body size, sharks generally have thicker skin compared to teleosts (Hebrank & Hebrank, 1986). Surprisingly, Fp for the bonnethead shark S. tiburo was not different from either the white grunt H. plumieri or sheepshead A. probatocephalus, and Fmax for A. probatocephalus was greater than that of S. tiburo. However, skin is not the only determinant of body stiffness. The perceived body stiffness is also a function of muscle, scales, and skeletal elements; differences exist between these factors for teleosts and sharks (Willemse, 1972; Hebrank & Hebrank, 1986).
BIOMECHANICS OF EXTANT TEETH
Despite past efforts to classify shark’s teeth into functionally relevant groups based on performance (Moss, 1977; Cappetta, 1987; Frazzetta, 1988; Motta, 2004), little biomechanical support was found for the tooth morphotypes. Differences in puncture performance occurred among shark species, both within prey items, and, when prey items were pooled, few overall patterns occurred. Teeth of C. leucas, which are triangular and serrated, were less efficient during puncture (higher Ep) of A. probatocephalus than the more thinly-cusped tooth of N. brevirostris. The broadly triangular C. carcharias teeth exhibited higher initial puncture forces on H. plumieri than thin-cusped C. limbatus and anterior I. oxyrinchus teeth, higher maximum puncture forces than both I. oxyrinchus and N. brevirostris, and lower efficiency than C. limbatus and I. oxyrinchus. Similarly, grouping the teeth by morphotype found that cutting teeth required higher maximum puncture force and had lower efficiency for puncturing H. plumieri than cutting– clutching teeth, and, when puncturing the thickscaled A. probatocephalus, they also required higher force to initially puncture the prey. This suggests that broader triangular teeth are less efficient and require more force for puncturing compared to narrower teeth. These data are supported by the results of the
CCA, although the white shark teeth, being larger than the others, might also account for higher puncture forces. Force at initial puncture on H. plumieri increases as CAR (cusp aspect ratio) decreases; in other words, the broader and shorter the tooth cusp, the more force it takes to initially puncture H. plumieri. This result is consistent with other studies on cutting, for both mammalian teeth and knives (Freeman & Lemen, 2007; Gilchrist etal., 2008). However, broader teeth did not consistently perform more poorly at puncturing for all prey types. For the softest prey item, E. saurus, there was no difference in any performance variable among different extant teeth or morphotypes. Additionally, there was no difference in Fmax or Fp among species for puncturing A. probatocephalus or S. tiburo.
In addition to contrasting patterns of puncture performance, surprisingly, there were no differences in draw performance among tooth morphologies when grouped by species or morphotype. Historically, tooth morphology has been the primary means of describing the biological role of teeth. Differences in draw and puncture performance were not consistent with the tearing, cutting, and cutting–clutching groupings. Furthermore, the CCA showed that, for successful draw tests, there was no correlation between tooth shape and force. Inclination, serration, and notching are cited as being characteristics of cutting teeth (Cappetta, 1987; Motta, 2004), although our data did not support a performance benefit to this morphology. It is possible that a shape parameter that was not measured, such as cutting edge sharpness, could correlate with draw performance. Testing the teeth in draw for only one prey item may also have lead to a lack of differences. Many of these species prey on a variety of prey items of different sizes and taxonomic affinities (Compagno, 1984a; Compagno, 1984b; Cortes, 1999). As teeth encounter different materials within and among prey, such as muscle, bone, cartilage, or crustacean exoskeleton, they may perform differently as they did during puncture. This is supported by the force-displacement traces for draw, which has several peaks (Fig. 4). The number of myosepta and myomeres cut matched the number of peaks on the force-displacement trace for the majority (54.5%) of the specimens, indicating that it may take more force to cut through a tough collagenous myoseptum than through muscle. As it has been suggested that myosepta not only transmit muscle forces, but also potentially constrain myomere bulging during contraction, these tissues should be relatively stiff and/or strong (Gembella et al., 2003; Brainard & Azizi, 2005). When considering both biological roles of puncturing and cutting, the majority of teeth did not perform better in puncture (Fp, Fmax) or unidirectional draw. Many extant teeth were able to both puncture

 and cut H. plumieri (Fig. 1). Furthermore, there were no differences in any performance variables for carcharhinid (C. limbatus and N. brevirostris) upper jaw or lower jaw teeth representing cutting–clutching When taking large prey, some carcharhinid sharks will bite, which engages the teeth in puncture, then laterally head shake, which engages the teeth in draw (Frazzetta & Prange, 1987). In this case, teeth must perform both roles within the same predation event. Teeth that perform multiple functions have been found in other elasmobranchs as well. For example, the bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium plagiosum, has small clutching teeth, but will take both hard and soft prey because the teeth passively rotate and flatten to form a surface for crushing (Ramsay & Wilga, 2007). Additionally, teeth in elasmobranchs are used for gripping females during mating, and this has also been shown to be related to tooth morphology (Springer, 1967; Compagno, 1970; Fedducia & Slaughter, 1974; McCourt & Kerstitch, 1980; Compagno, 1988; Kajiura & Tricas, 1996). When structures have multiple functions, they may not be optimized for any one function, making correlations between form and function difficult (Reif, 1983; Lauder, 1995; Koehl, 1996; Domenici & Blake, 2000).
For all teeth with successful draw tests, it took less force to make an initial puncture than to draw a tooth through the prey item, although the maximum force produced during puncture was equal to the force produced during draw. As a tooth continues to enter the prey item after the initial puncture, the initial rift is widened when new tissue is being punctured at the tooth apex. One study found that mammalian prey muscle and fat offered little resistance, implying that differences in initial puncture between sharp and blunt cusps are erased because most of the force is generated as the teeth widen the hole made by penetration (Freeman & Lemen, 2007). During initial puncture on teleost prey items, only scales and skin are penetrated but, as the tooth continues through the prey item, it also encounters muscle tissue and myosepta. Because the draw experiments were carried out with the cusp already embedded in the prey item, it was encountering four materials throughout the entire test.
Despite a lack of clear patterns, it is clear that some of the teeth performed as predicted by their morphotype (Fig. 1). Scymnodon ringens could not cut during draw, but was able to puncture H. plumieri. The multicusped H. griseus teeth would not puncture H. plumieri, and the notched and heavily serrated G. cuvier teeth had only one successful puncture, yet both teeth were able to cut during unidirectional draw. Furthermore, P. glauca could not puncture any prey except H. plumieri, whereas S. mokarran could not puncture A. probatocephalus or S. tiburo, yet both
teeth could cut during draw. When all teeth that fail at puncturing are considered, a morphological pattern emerges. The cusp apices of these teeth are distally inclined to the point where the flat surface of the mesial cutting edge contacts the prey during puncture, and not the tip of the tooth. For a given force, this increases the amount of stress applied to the prey item because stress is equal to force divided by area. Compressing the prey item during the initial stages of puncture creates compressive forces beneath the tooth tip and tension on the surrounding substrate as the prey item bulges around the tooth. These stresses together generate an effective shear stress, which, if large enough, ruptures the tissues (Frazzetta, 1988). The flat surface of these teeth may decrease stress on the prey item to the extent that puncture (failure) is not possible. This is further supported by studies on mammalian tooth shape, where blunter teeth required significantly more force to puncture insects (Evans & Sanson, 1998), fruits (Freeman & Weins, 1997) and mammalian hides (Freeman & Lemen, 2007) compared to sharp teeth. For sharks, however, the tension in the bulging tissue may facilitate cutting during unidirectional draw. As the tooth is moved across the prey during draw, the tip of the cusp can engage the tissue, creating compression directly under the cusp tip and further adding tension via more bulging (Frazzetta, 1988). Thus, the angle of the tooth apex with respect to the prey item, whether from the natural position within the jaw or from the shape and position of the prey, may affect tooth function.
Teeth of the upper and lower jaws may also interact with each other. How teeth of the upper and lower jaws shear past each other and how teeth of the same jaw affect puncture and cutting during draw are unanswered questions. A study using utility blades as proxies for upper and lower jaw teeth indicated that certain combinations of blade shapes affect cutting efficiency (Anderson & LaBarbera, 2008). The flexible collagenous attachment of shark teeth may also facilitate cutting during draw as the teeth may pivot anteroposteriorly around obstructions preventing them from ‘hanging up’ on tough material (Frazzetta, 1988). In reality, sharks teeth form a functional complex and do not work alone. Tooth base overlap within the same jaw may transmit forces to linked teeth because overlapping bases are lashed together with collagenous Sharpey’s fibres (Frazzetta, 1988). Tooth size is also likely to play a role in performance. Each morphotype includes teeth and species of different sizes. For example, the cutting morphotype includes the white shark C. carcharias and the bull shark C. leucas, although the teeth are very different in size (Fig. 2). The larger C. carcharias tooth may be blunter, requiring more force than the C. leucas tooth

to create enough stress to puncture a given prey item, potentially masking a direct relationship with morphology. Lastly, it is also possible that force and efficiency may not be what is under selective pressure, but rather the severity and type of damage inflicted on the prey by the various tooth morphologies.
FOSSIL TOOTH MECHANICS
In general, fossil teeth did not perform well in unidirectional draw, but performed similarly to modern teeth in puncture. Out of the three fossil morphologies tested, only Cladodus sp. was successful in draw. Failure of the Hybodus sp. and X. compressus teeth to successfully draw may partly be a result of a lack of sharpness during our tooth reconstruction. In addition, these teeth lack a sharp notch on the distal edge or serrations where stress may be concentrated (Frazzetta, 1988; Motta, 2004) as do many extant teeth (e.g. I oxyrinchus and C. carcharias, respectively). By contrast, Hybodus teeth have a functional notch between the main cusp and the first distal cusplet, though it is not bladed.
All three fossil morphologies were successful at puncture, although to varying degrees. Cladodus sp. was able to puncture all prey items. Overall, Cladodus sp. produced higher forces and was less efficient (higher Ep) than the majority of the extant teeth. For the softest and hardest prey items (E. saurus and C. sapidus, respectively), the Cladodus tooth performed similarly to extant teeth. Considering all the performance tests, Cladodus teeth appear to function similarly to many of the extant teeth. Interestingly the majority of the concurrent possible prey items during the Paleozoic were armored, including placoderms, cephalopods, and osteichthyans with rhomboid scales (Brett & Walker, 2002). It is important to note that some ‘soft’ prey were also available in the form of acanthodian fishes, conodonts, and other chondrichthyans. Direct and indirect evidence, in the form of preserved gut contents and trace fossils on potential prey items, exists for cladodont shark predation on both hard and ‘soft’ prey (Mapes & Hansen, 1984; Williams, 1990; Mapes et al., 1995), and their teeth appear biomechanically suited for a variety of functional prey types.
Xenacanthus compressus teeth were able to puncture E. saurus, H. plumieri, and C. sapidus, but not A. probatocephalus or S. tiburo. Overall, X. compressus produced higher forces than the majority of the extant teeth and were less efficient at puncture than several modern teeth but, similar to Cladodus sp., were not different from extant teeth in puncturing E. saurus or C. sapidus. It is therefore possible that X. compressus was similarly capable of handling a
variety of prey items, although perhaps not as diverse as Cladodus. Although there is no evidence for durophagy in xenacanthid sharks (Soler-Gijon, 1995; Kriwet et al., 2008), the teeth appear biomechanically suited for puncture of hard prey.
The multicusped Hybodus sp. tooth was the least successful at puncturing ‘soft’ prey items; only one trial on H. plumieri was successful. However, these teeth were able to puncture the blue crab C. sapidus. Cappetta (1987) designates the majority of Hybodus teeth as clutching-type (i.e. those Hybodus teeth with smaller central cusps), with others falling into tearing-type (i.e. those with a high central cusp). There is no dietary data for hybodont sharks; however, the Hybodus tooth used in the present study has a relatively small central cusp compared to the lateral cusplets, and the lack of soft prey puncture and draw supports a nontearing role. Because this tooth was only successful at puncturing hard prey, it appears suited for durophagy.
CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, we investigated the performance of three general categories of extant teeth, tearingtype, cutting-type, and cutting–clutching type, as well as three fossil morphologies, on a variety of prey items. Differences in puncturing performance occurred among different prey items, indicating that not all ‘soft’ prey items are alike. The majority of teeth were able to puncture different prey items, and differences in puncture performance also occurred among tooth types. Overall, few morphological patterns were identified. In some cases, broader triangular teeth were less effective at puncturing than narrow-cusped teeth. Many of the extant shark teeth in this study were not only able to perform draw and puncture equally well, but tooth morphologies were functionally equivalent to each other. The findings obtained in the present study lend limited support to the belief that tooth morphology is a good predictor of biological role. Additionally, fossil morphologies were generally successful at puncture and overall similar in performance to extant teeth, but only Cladodus sp. was able to perform in draw.
