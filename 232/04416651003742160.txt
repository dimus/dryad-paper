A new puddle frog (Phrynobatrachidae: Phrynobatrachus) from the Mambilla Plateau in eastern Nigeria

Abstract.—A new species of puddle frog (Phrynobatrachus) is described from the Kurmin Danko Forest Reserve on the western edge of the Mambilla Plateau in eastern Nigeria. The new species is distinguished from both geographically proximate and closely related Phrynobatrachus species by the combination of its body size (larger than the closely related P. chukuchuku, P. manengoubensis, and P. werneri), degree of development of male traits, and a unique ventral colour pattern in males. Molecular phylogenetic analysis reveals that this new species is closely related to P. werneri and P. manengoubensis, which, together with several other species, form a clade restricted to the mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line. This new Phrynobatrachus is the first known amphibian species hypothesized to be endemic to the Mambilla Plateau of eastern Nigeria.
Key words.—Amphibia, Anura, biodiversity hotspot, Cameroon Volcanic Line, new species, Taraba State
Little is known of the amphibian diversity of Nigeria. Most accounts have focused on the biology of specific species (e.g. Walker 1966, 1967, 1969; Eniang et al. 2003; Aisien et al. 2004; Imasuen et al. 2009) or faunal surveys of lowland regions (e.g. Romer 1953; Walker 1968; Reid et al. 1990; Eniang & Luiselli 2002; Onadeko & Ro ̈del 2009). Schiøtz (1963; see also Schiøtz, 1966) synthesised knowledge of Nigerian amphibians, yet this important work focused mostly on the southernmost regions of Nigeria (but also the Jos Plateau) and preceded most of the important taxonomic studies for the region by Amiet (e.g. 1971a,b, 1972a,b, 1973a, 1977, 1980a,b, 1981, 2000, 2001, 2004a,b) and others (e.g. Kobel et al. 1980; Nussbaum 1985; Loumont & Kobel 1991; Lawson 2000; Herrmann et al. 2004; Ro ̈del et al. 2004; Plath et al. 2006; Uyeda et al. 2007; Blackburn 2008b; Blackburn et al. 2009; Zimkus 2009). The amphibian fauna is poorly documented for many regions of Nigeria, and it is particularly surprising that the mountains of eastern Nigeria have received such little attention. Given patterns of diversity in the mountains of neighbouring Cameroon, it is reasonable to expect that the mountains of Nigeria may host regionally important diversity, including endemic species.
The mountains of eastern Nigeria are a continuation of those in Cameroon (Fig. 1), and together with the Gulf of Guinea Islands form the geological structure known as the Cameroon Volcanic Line (De ́ruelle et al. 1991; Marzoli et al. 2000). This region is part of the ‘West African Forests’ biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al.

2000) and the fauna found in the diverse habitats encountered throughout the Cameroon Volcanic Line is one of the most diverse in Africa (Stuart 1986; Burgess et al. 2004). Amphibians are especially diverse in the mountains and islands of the Cameroon Volcanic Line from where many new species have been described during the past five decades; however, little of this research has dealt explicitly with the Nigerian amphibian fauna.
The amphibian fauna of the mountains in eastern Nigeria is best documented from surveys of the Obudu Plateau (e.g. Schiøtz 1963, 1966; Gartshore 1986; Lea et al. 2005). The frog fauna of Obudu is a continuation of that found in the mountains of neighbouring Cameroon, including the Acha-Tugi Ridge (Amiet 1981; Gartshore 1986; Schiøtz 1963, 1966). Based on surveys in the early 1980s, Gartshore (1986) speculated that trends of environmental degradation on the Obudu Plateau might be reversed due to changes in management practices. Unfortunately, field surveys conducted in the mid-to-late 1980s and in 2002 revealed that much of the forest on the plateau had been cleared for agriculture and/or grazing lands and most of the remaining forest was restricted to lower elevation escarpments (Ash & Sharland 1986; Ash & Dowsett-Lemaire 1989; Lea et al. 2005). It should be noted that although Schiøtz (1969) credited Parker (1936) and Sanderson (1936) for presenting details on amphibians of eastern Nigeria, the region of the surveys of

these authors is now within Southwest Province of the Republic of Cameroon. In contrast to the several surveys of the Obudu Plateau, little is known of the amphibian fauna of the Mambilla Plateau and Gotel Mountains (including the Gangirwal, the highest mountain in Nigeria at an elevation of 􏰂2400m). Most present knowledge of the fauna of the highlands of Taraba State and Adamawa State in eastern Nigeria comes from a multi-investigator research expedition in 1988 (Ash & Dowsett-Lemaire 1989, summarized in Dowsett 1989; but see also Hall 1976; Ash & Sharland 1986). The 1988 expedition spent 10 days in the mountains of Taraba and Adamawa states, including six on the Gangirwal, three days surveying the grasslands of the Mambilla Plateau, but only one in the Ngel Nyaki and Kurmin Danko forests on the western edge of the Mambilla Plateau. Perhaps as a consequence, only two species of frog Amietophrynus maculatus and Leptopelis nordequatorialis) were collected in the grasslands of the Mambilla Plateau and none from its forests (Bo ̈hme & Nikolaus 1989; see also Gartshore 1986). Other relevant amphibian records include Hyperolius riggenbachi from the Mambilla Plateau (Schiøtz 1967) and Petropedetes parkeri from low elevations on the northern edge of the plateau along the road from Gombe to Serti (Gartshore 1986). The general lack of intensive vertebrate surveys in the forests of Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve and neighbouring Kurmin Danko Forest Reserve is unfortunate. By being perhaps the most floristically diverse forests in all of Nigeria (Chapman & Chapman 2001), these forest reserves hold great promise for being similarly diverse in terms of vertebrate taxa. Indeed, these form the only locality for the subspecies of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes vellerosus) endemic to Cameroon and Nigeria (Beck & Chapman 2008).
During a recent preliminary survey of the submontane forests (1400􏰐1600 m) of Ngel Nyaki and Kurmin Danko at the western edge of the Mambilla Plateau (Fig. 1), specimens of a new species of Phrynobatrachus (Phrynobatrachidae) were collected. The genus Phrynobatrachus (sensu Scott 2005) contains more than 70 species found in diverse habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa and ongoing systematic research reveals that biogeographic patterns within this genus are complex (Zimkus et al. in press). However, recent study has also revealed that there is a diverse clade of Phrynobatrachus endemic to the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria (Zimkus 2009; Zimkus et al. in press). The new species described here is a member of this clade and further highlights the Cameroon Volcanic Line as a centre of speciation in Phrynobatrachus as well as other African vertebrates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
During April 2009, specimens were collected in Kurmin Danko Forest Reserve in Taraba State in eastern Nigeria (Fig. 1). Similar surveys were made in forests in nearby Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve and degraded riparian forests in grasslands on the plateau, but specimens of this new species were not found at other sites. Morphological comparisons presented herein are based on first-hand examination of specimens (see Appendix 1 for specimens examined). Importantly, many of these specimens were included in recent molecular phylogenetic studies (Zimkus 2009; Zimkus et al. in press), leading to increased certainty of their identification. In addition, type specimens of six species (P. alleni, P. chukuchuku, P. guttorosus, P. manengoubensis, P. steindachneri, P. werneri) were examined during the course of

this work. Comparisons were made with all currently recognised species of Phrynobatrachus from Cameroon and neighbouring countries with a few minor exceptions. First, the recently described P. nlonakoensis (Plath et al. 2006) was excluded from comparisons as this has been demonstrated to be a species of Arthroleptis (Fre ́ tey 2008; Zimkus & Larson 2009). Second, comparisons to P. sternfeldi were not possible; this species from present-day Central African Republic is known only from the type material. Also, comparisons to P. natalensis, which has a large geographic range extending throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, were based on specimens from Cameroon and Nigeria. These observations are also consistent with MCZ specimens of P. natalensis from Transvaal, a region near the type locality in South Africa (unpubl. data); note that specimens cited by Blackburn (2005) as types of P. natalensis are instead the type specimens of P. duckeri Loveridge 1953, which is a junior synonym of P. natalensis. Comparisons to Phrynobatrachus steindachneri are based on both a syntype and specimens collected throughout the range of the species, but not from Lake Oku where another cryptic species may occur (e.g. Amiet in litt.; Zimkus 2009; Zimkus & Blackburn unpubl. data). Only specimens of P. ogoensis from Gabon were studied because of doubt regarding the validity of considering P. brongersmai as a junior synonym of P. ogoensis (IUCN 2009). Following Fre ́tey (2008), P. accraensis is treated as a junior synonym of P. latifrons (contra Ro ̈del & Agyei 2003).
All measurements (9 0.1 mm) were taken using digital callipers and a dissecting microscope; limb measurements were taken on the right side. Measurements generally follow Blackburn (2005), which is a modification of Matsui (1984). In addition, tympanum height was measured as the vertical diameter of the tympanum, outer metatarsal length was measured as the maximum anteroposterior length, tarsus length was measured as the distance from the most proximal crurotarsal surface to the proximal edge of the inner metatarsal tubercle, and the distance from the most proximal crurotarsal surface to the proximal edge of the tarsal tubercle was also measured. Museum abbreviations follow Leviton et al. (1985). Sex of specimens was determined by the presence of secondary sexual characters in males (e.g. dark throat, gular spines, nuptial pads on manual digits) and the presence of eggs and/or large body size without male traits for females. The webbing formula used is based on Savage & Heyer (1967), though without the􏴣and 􏰐 annotation which can be very subjective (i.e. Myers & Duellman 1982). However, these data on webbing should be considered tentative as they are not intended to represent a thorough intraspecific survey.
To determine the phylogenetic relationships of this morphologically distinctive new species, DNA sequence data were collected for four specimens: three of the new species (MCZ A-139529􏰐31; two males and one female) and one of Phrynobatrachus werneri (MCZ A-138074). Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples using a guanidine thiocyanate method following the protocol of Esselstyn et al. (2008). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a region of mitochondrial DNA (􏰀2400 bp) comprising genes encoding for 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA and the intervening valine transfer RNA; primer pairs and PCR conditions follow Darst & Cannatella (2004). Purification and sequencing follows Esselstyn et al. (2008). Consensus sequences were generated in Sequencer v.4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation) and manually vetted. Resulting sequence lengths are as follows: P. sp. nov. (MCZ

A-139529: 1952 bp; MCZ A-139530: 2360 bp; MCZ A-139531: 1522 bp) and P. werneri (MCZ-138074: 2382 bp). Newly collected sequences were accessioned in GenBank (Table 1).
For phylogenetic analysis, these newly collected sequences were included in an analysis with the dataset of Zimkus (2009; see Table 1). However, sequences for two specimens (P. auritus MCZ A-136792, and P. steindachneri MVZ 253342) were excluded because of ambiguous nucleotides for a region of data in the middle of this mitogenomic region. A multiple alignment of the resulting data set, comprising DNA sequences of unequal length for 59 terminal taxa, was generated using default parameters in Clustal X v.1.83.1 (Thompson et al. 1997). Minor manual modifications of the alignment of one sequence of P. danko (MCZ A-139530; GenBank GU732282) were made following visual inspection of the alignment; these modifications consisted of a one-base pair shift in a 58 bp of the 12S RNA region, apparently caused by an insertion of an adenine at position 304 of this sequence (chromatograms were double-checked for verification). The resulting alignment was trimmed such that it represents the same 5? and 3? positions used in the analysis by Zimkus (2009); these positions correspond, respectively, to positions 2070􏰐4650 of the Xenopus laevis mitochondrial genome (GenBank NC-001573).
The best-fit model of sequence evolution selected using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and MrModeltest v.2.3 (Nylander 2004) was the GTR􏴣I􏴣G model (lnL􏴤􏴥16028.05; AIC􏴤32076.09). Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian estimates of phylogeny were generated. ML analyses were conducted on the aligned sequence data in Garli v.0.96b8 (Zwickl 2006) using a random starting tree and a GTR􏴣I􏴣G model of sequence evolution with all parameters estimated. Each search was terminated one hundred thousand generations after the last topological improvement. Fifty search repetitions of this ML analysis were carried out and the estimate with the lowest -ln likelihood score was used as the preferred ML phylogeny. One thousand nonparametric bootstrap replicates were performed in Garli using the same model of evolution with one search replicate per bootstrap replicate with each search terminated 20000 generations after the last topological improvement. Branches present in ]70% of the bootstrap replicate phylogenies were considered well-supported following Hillis & Bull (1993). A Bayesian estimate of phylogeny was obtained using MrBayes v.3.1.2 and a GTR􏴣I􏴣G model of sequence evolution. Four runs of four MCMC chains were run for 20 million generations, sampled every 2 000 generations, using a temperature of 0.2 and default priors. Convergence was assessed by examining correlations of split frequencies among runs in AWTY (Nylander et al. 2008). The first two million generations were discarded as burn-in, following examination of trends and distributions of log-likelihoods and parameter values using Tracer v1.4 (Rambaut & Drummond 2007); estimated sample sizes (ESS) from the four combined runs were all above 11600. The phylogeny and posterior probabilities were then estimated from the remaining trees; split support was calculated using SumTrees (Sukumaran & Holder 2008). Topologies with posterior probabilities ]95% were considered well-supported following Wilcox et al. (2002). Based on Zimkus (2009) and Zimkus et al. (in press), Phrynobatrachus sandersoni was used as an outgroup to root the phylogeny.

Variation.—The single female collected of P. danko is morphologically similar to males but lacks the male secondary sexual traits (dark and distended throat, spines on the gular region or elsewhere, and thickened skin on the surface of the first finger). The colouration is generally similar except that the gular region is not darkened. Instead, the gular region of the female exhibits a similar base colouration to the ventral surface with scattered and irregularly clumped melanophores.

Colouration in life.—(Fig. 2). Dorsal colouration ruddy brown with small flecks of pale grey (Fig. 2A); darker markings on dorsal and lateral surfaces ranging from medium to dark grey or even black; in males, ventral surface of throat is solid black with small white or grey spines (Fig. 2B); venter ranging from orangey to pale yellow with flecks or small spots of dark grey; ventral surface of limbs pinkish; iris dark grey with black pupil (Fig. 2A).
Etymology.—The specific epithet is a noun in apposition and refers to Kurmin Danko Forest Reserve.
Distribution and natural history.—At present, P. danko is known only from the Kurmin Danko Forest Reserve on the western edge of the Mambilla Plateau in Taraba State in Nigeria. All specimens were collected from a single locality in montane forest during the day (1300􏰐1500 H). Males were found in a small pool (approx. 80 cm at its widest; approx. 10 cm deep) in an essentially dry streambed with a small seep. The single female was actively moving through leaf litter several meters away from this pool. No other frogs were collected syntopically. A specimen of Chamaeleo wiedersheimi wiedersheimi was observed but not collected and recent nests of Pan troglodytes were observed in nearby trees. Frog genera present at the nearby Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve (B4km from Kurmin Danko Forest Reserve) include Amietophrynus, Arthroleptis, Astylosternus, Cardioglossa, Leptodactylodon, Leptopelis, Ptychadena, and Phrynobatrachus (P. steindachneri).
Conservation.—There is at present insufficient information to evaluate the conservation status of P. danko; thus, it should be considered Data Deficient according to IUCN (2006) criteria. However, considering that the only known locality in a small patch of forest (B10 km2) in which there has been both historical (Chapman et al. 2004) and recent deforestation (Chapman, pers. comm.) to create agricultural or grazing lands, it is likely that P. danko is a species threatened by anthropogenic modification of its forest habitat. The type specimens of P. danko were negative for the presence of the chytrid fungus Batracochytrium dendrobatidis in a PCR-based screen (Reeder, Cheng, & Vredenburg, unpublished data).
Remarks.—The phylogenetic analysis indicates that P. danko forms a clade with P. werneri and P. manengoubensis (Fig. 4). This relationship is strongly supported by both maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimates of phylogeny. These three species are part of a much larger clade restricted to the mountains (P. chukuchuku, P. cricogaster, P. steindachneri) and associated lowlands (P. batesii) of the Cameroon Volcanic Line (Fig. 4; Zimkus 2009).
DISCUSSION
For approximately a third of the twentieth century, only two species of Phrynobatrachus (P. steindachneri and P. werneri) were known from the mountains of Cameroon; both were described from specimens collected on the Adamawa Plateau

in northern Cameroon (Nieden 1910). In the mid-twentieth century, Angel (1940) and Perret (1957) described, respectively, P. manengoubensis and P. cricogaster. Both of these species were described based on specimens from Mt. Manengouba, which lies just southwest of the Bamile ́ke ́ Plateau. Despite suggestions that one or several undescribed species of Phrynobatrachus existed in the Cameroonian mountains (e.g. Amiet 1975, in litt.; Bo ̈hme 1975; Gartshore 1986; Bo ̈hme & Schneider 1987; Bo ̈hme & Nikolaus 1989), more than a half-century passed before the description of another montane species of Phrynobatrachus (i.e. P. chukuchuku; Zimkus 2009). Note that this does not include the species from Mt. Nlonako recently described by Plath et al. (2006) and assigned to Phrynobatrachus, but which, based on morphology, was later demonstrated to be a species of Arthroleptis (Fre ́tey 2008; Zimkus & Larson 2009). The description of P. danko from the forest of the Mambilla Plateau, as well as ongoing research (Zimkus & Blackburn, unpubl. data), suggests that more species of Phrynobatrachus remain to be described from the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria (e.g. Amiet 1973b, 1975, in litt.). Such cryptic diversity in these mountains is

not unexpected; it is already known in other anuran genera such as Arthroleptis (Blackburn 2008a; Blackburn et al. 2009). Indeed, new data obtained in this study for P. werneri suggests additional cryptic diversity may soon be forthcoming.
The estimate of phylogeny for the Phrynobatrachus species included here differs in several key respects with that of Zimkus (2009). In the present study, P. latifrons and P. africanus were found to form a clade. Considering the poor taxonomic sampling of species of Phrynobatrachus that are not restricted to the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria, such a difference is not surprising. Indeed, the relationships found in both this study and that of Zimkus (2009) for several more distantly related Phrynobatrachus differ in key ways from a phylogeny with a much more thorough taxonomic sampling (Zimkus et al. in press). However, when considering the clade restricted to the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria, which is highly supported in all analyses (Fig. 4; Zimkus 2009; Zimkus et al. in press), the pattern of phylogenetic relationships is similar. The disagreements between the phylogeny presented here and those of Zimkus (2009) and Zimkus et al. (in press) appear to be due to uncertainty in the placement of the recently described P. chukuchuku from Mt. Oku in Cameroon. Zimkus (2009) and Zimkus et al. (in press) found P. chukuchuku to be sister to a clade containing P. batesii, P. manengoubensis, and P. werneri, whereas in the present study P. chukuchuku is the sister to P. cricogaster and P. steindachneri (Fig. 4). Yet, the phylogenetic placement of P. chukuchuku does not have high support in any of these three studies (Fig. 4; Zimkus 2009; Zimkus et al. in press), including one in which data from the nuclear genome is included (Zimkus et al. in press). There is support neither for a sister relationship between P. chukuchuku and the other montane species in this clade (non-parametric bootstap support [NBS]: 0%; Bayesian posterior probability [PP]: 0.00) nor for P. chukuchuku to form a clade with P. danko, P. manengoubensis, and P. werneri (NBS: 4%; PP: 0.00). Increased taxonomic sampling via the discovery of new Phrynobatrachus species in Cameroon or Nigeria may lead to resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of P. chukuchuku.
In the recent phylogenetic analysis presented by Zimkus (2009), P. werneri was found to be paraphyletic with respect to P. manengoubensis. If true, this would support a previous claim (i.e. A.G.C. Grandison in litt.; cited by Frost 2009) that P. manengoubensis is a junior synonym of P. werneri. To further address this hypothesis, an additional specimen of P. werneri (MCZ A-138074), collected from the Bamboutos Mountains in Cameroon, was included in the phylogenetic analysis along with data used by Zimkus (2009) for specimens from the Obudu Plateau (MVZ 253334), just south of Mt. Oku (Ndop; MVZ 234835), and the caldera of Mt. Manengouba (the type locality of P. manengoubensis). In the present analysis, specimens referred to P. manengoubensis from Mt. Manengouba and P. werneri from the Bamboutos Mountains and near Mt. Oku formed strongly supported and reciprocally monophyletic clades (Fig. 4). The single specimen from the Obudu Plateau was found to be sister to these two clades. Based simply on this pattern of phylogenetic relationships, two alternative taxonomic arrangements exist. Either (1) all of these specimens, including those from Mt. Manengouba, should be referred to P. werneri or (2) the population from the Obudu Plateau represents yet another undescribed species of Phrynobatrachus. Zimkus (2009) observed no significant morphometric differences between specimens referred to P. werneri and P. manengoubensis included in that recent phylogenetic study. However, the specimen from the Obudu Plateau is immature (MVZ 253334; 15.8 mm SVL), which makes

comparisons difficult because many of the relevant diagnostic traits are male secondary sexual characters (this study; Zimkus 2009). At present, the specimens from the Obudu Plateau for which DNA sequence data are available are inadequate for addressing the systematics of this population. Schiøtz (1963) presented details on a population of Phrynobatrachus on the Obudu Plateau, which he referred to P. werneri. Examination of specimens from Schiøtz’s (1963) series (ZMUC R071989􏰐 93, R071995, R071998􏰐202, R07199205) reveals that his description of this population is correct. Yet these specimens should not be referred to P. werneri or any other described species from the mountains of Cameroon or Nigeria; a study of this undescribed species is currently in preparation (Blackburn & Ro ̈ del, unpublished data). Lea et al. (2005) identify the population of P. werneri from the Obudu Plateau as one of relatively few anuran species that have persisted on the plateau despite widespread environmental degradation, but it is unknown whether these observations refer to specimens similar to MVZ 253334, those of Schiøtz’s (1963) series, or still another species.
This study presents the description of the first species of a frog that is possibly endemic to the Mambilla Plateau of eastern Nigeria. However, there is promise that additional species of several genera could be recognised in the future. New taxa of frogs have been recently described from nearby mountains in Cameroon (Bo ̈hme & Schneider 1987; Hermmann et al. 2004) and the forests on the tallest mountain in Nigeria (Gangirwal) appear to contain a number of undescribed species (Bo ̈hme & Nikolaus 1989). However, without more faunal surveys in the mountains of eastern Nigeria to complement those in the many mountains of Cameroon, our knowledge of amphibian diversity and its evolutionary history, will remain woefully incomplete for this biodiversity hotspot.
