Morphological convergence of the prey-killing arsenal of sabertooth predators
Julie A. Meachen-Samuels
Abstract.—Sabertooth members of the Felidae, Nimravidae, and Barbourofelidae are well-known for their elongated saber-shaped canines. However, within these groups, there is a wide range of independently derived tooth shapes and lengths, including dirk-tooth and scimitar-tooth morphs. In conjunction with the saberteeth, forelimbs were also used to subdue prey. Thus, there may be a functional link between canine shape and forelimb morphology. Because there are no living sabertooth forms for comparison, extant felids make a good proxy for examining the morphology of these extinct organisms. Here, I examine the forelimb morphology of different sabertooth groups from across North America; I address whether forelimb morphologies are associated with tooth morphologies, and whether these associated tooth and forelimb morphologies are convergent among different families. To answer these questions, I analyzed six functional indices of the forelimbs and two canine characters for 13 species of sabertooth predators and 15 extant felid species. Results indicate that sabertooth morphs with longer, thinner canines show more robust limb proportions. These patterns were convergent among sabertooth felids, nimravids, and barbourofelids, and indicate a positive functional relationship between saber elongation and increased forelimb robustness. This suggests that sabertooth carnivorans demonstrated niche partitioning of predation strategies according to canine shape and corresponding forelimb morphology.

Introduction
Sabertooth carnivores are a well-studied group of extinct predators, best known for their fearsome-looking saber-shaped canine teeth. The focus of most previous functional studies has been on prey-killing behavior, and much of the emphasis has been directed at the cranium, neck, and teeth (e.g., Emerson and Radinsky 1980; Akersten 1985; Van Valkenburgh et al. 1990; Van Valkenburgh and Hertel 1993; Anyonge 1996a; Biknevicius and Van Valkenburgh 1996; Bryant 1996; Martin 1998a,b; Anto ́ n and Galobart 1999; Anto ́n et al. 2005; Therrien 2005; Wroe et al. 2005; Christiansen 2006, 2007; McHenry et al. 2007; Slater and Van Valkenburgh 2008). Less attention has been directed at the other important part of the prey-killing arsenal: the forelimbs, which are used to hold and position prey during dispatch (e.g., Schultz and Martin 1970; Gonyea 1976; Van Valkenburgh 1985, 1987; Anyonge 1996b; Lewis 1997; Wroe et al. 2008; Salesa et al. 2010; Lewis and Lague 2010; Christiansen 2011).
Sabertooth carnivorans include the sabertooth Felidae (cats) and the extinct families
Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae. The canine teeth of these three extinct groups are similar in shape and structure by way of convergent evolution (see Fig. 1 for relationships) (Turner and Anto ́n 1997; Martin 1998a,b). Nimravids flourished in North America from the late Eocene through the early Miocene, whereas sabertooth felids had their heyday from the late Miocene through the Pleistocene (Martin 1998a,b). Although sabertooth cats coexisted with the genus Barbourofelis (,11–6 Ma) in the late Miocene, sabertooth cats and nimravids were not contemporaries in North America (Martin 1998a,b), and it is likely that felids replaced nimravids in the sabertooth niche (Meehan and Martin 2003).
Previous studies have separated the sabertooth predatory niche into dirk-tooth forms and scimitar-tooth forms (Kurte ́n 1963; Martin 1980, 1998a,b). Dirk-tooth sabers are very elongated, laterally compressed, with no, or fine, serrations. By comparison, scimitar-tooth sabers are less elongated, less compressed, and often coarsely serrated. Along with their distinct tooth morphologies, these two groups

have also been separated by postcranial morphology. The dirktooth forms are thought to be ambush predators with more robust limbs, whereas the scimitartooth forms are thought to be more cursorial predators with relatively gracile limbs (Kurte ́n 1963; Martin 1980, 1998a,b). One additional group of sabertooth predators, exemplified by the felid genus Xenosmilus, had a combination of robust forelimbs and scimitar-shaped canines (Martin et al. 2000).
Because felids are extant, they make good proxies for examining the morphology of the extinct sabertooth forms. Living cats are all hypercarnivores, having a diet composed of greater than 70% vertebrate meat (Van Valkenburgh 1991), which they procure by using a combination of both the cranium and the forelimbs to secure and kill prey. For large prey, they do so by applying a prolonged chokehold to the throat or nose of the prey
with the anterior teeth (canines and incisors) after first subduing prey with the forelimbs (Ewer 1973). In large cats, both the forelimbs and cranium show morphological adaptations to deal with the stresses applied by struggling prey. Some of these features include enlarged anterior teeth, robust forelimbs, and expanded areas for muscle attachments (Gonyea 1978; Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2009a,b).
Living cats and sabertooth morphs should all have cranial and postcranial morphological adaptations to kill prey, with one major difference. The round, or conical-shaped, canines of living cats are well suited for killing using a prolonged chokehold, because they are able to withstand forces in all directions (Van Valkenburgh and Ruff 1987). The elongated saberteeth of the extinct forms look ferocious and formidable, but these laterally compressed canine teeth are actually rather fragile compared to conical canines. This would have precluded sabertooth morphs from killing with a prolonged chokehold (Van Valkenburgh and Ruff 1987; Slater and Van Valkenburgh 2008). With long, thin sabers, it is also important to avoid contact with bone, such as the vertebral column of the prey (Van Valkenburgh and Ruff 1987). Successful preycapture and killing in sabertooth predators could consequently be accomplished by first subduing prey using strong forelimbs (Gonyea 1976, 1978; Anyonge 1996b; Turner and Anto ́n 1997; Wroe et al. 2008; Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2010).
Thus, if sabertooth cats used their forelimbs more extensively than living cats to subdue prey, their forelimbs should show exaggerated adaptations for prey-killing. Previous analyses of similar questions have primarily focused on dirk-tooth ambush predators. Notably, the sabertooth cat, Smilodon fatalis, has been of particular interest with regard to prey-killing behavior because of its exceptionally robust forelimbs (Gonyea 1976; Anyonge 1996b; Wroe et al. 2008; Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2010). However, the more gracile scimitar-tooth cats have been largely neglected (but see Lewis 1996, 1997; Martin et al. 2000; Salesa et al. 2010; Lewis and Lague 2010). The postcrania of nimravids and barbourofelids

have also been poorly studied, but they are known to have short, robust limbs, with a few exceptions (Matthew 1910; Van Valkenburgh 1985; Bryant 1991; Martin 1998a).
Here, I examine and compare the forelimb morphology of different sabertooth carnivorans from across North America. I address the following questions: (1) Were forelimbs of sabertooths more robust overall than those of extant conical-tooth cats? (2) Are particular forelimb morphologies associated with distinct tooth morphologies (as in dirk versus scimitar morphs)? and (3) Were these associated tooth and forelimb morphologies convergent among the felids, barbourofelids, and nimravids, indicating functional prey-killing niches?
Methods
To answer these questions, I took measurements for 13 species of extant felids, the extinct conical-tooth cat Panthera atrox, which is larger than any of the sabertooth species included here, eight species of sabertooth felids, five species of nimravids, and one barbourofelid (Table 1; see also Appendices 1 and 2 in the supplementary material). Because of the incomplete nature of the fossil specimens, comparisons used species averages instead of individual specimen measurements for both fossil and extant species. Using digital calipers (to the nearest 0.1 mm), I took a set of 12 forelimb measurements for the humerus, radius, ulna, and metacarpals, following MeachenSamuels and Van Valkenburgh (2009b) (Table 2). These measurements were used to compute a set of six functional indices (ratios), which indicate overall forelimb strength and the ability to manipulate large prey with the forelimbs during prey capture (MeachenSamuels and Van Valkenburgh 2009b) (Table 3). Indices were chosen for this study because they have mechanical implications that represent functional relationships between linear measurements (Van Valkenburgh 1987; Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2008). These functional indices were also chosen because they are easily measured and calculated, improving their utility in future studies of extinct species. There are some problems with ratio use, such as the violation of homoscedas-
ticity and normality in some statistical tests (Sokal and Rohlf 1995). Even with these complications, many studies have found functional ratios to be robust and statistically valid (e.g., Van Valkenburgh 1987; Van Valkenburgh and Koepfli 1993; Ruff 2000; Elissamburu and Vizca ́ıno 2004; Jungers et al. 2005; Kirk et al. 2008; Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2009b). Canine mediolateral diameters (at the enamel/dentine junction), with the exception of Barbourofelis loveorum, were measured directly from specimens. Canine tooth crown heights (from the enamel/dentine junction to the tip) were measured from specimen photos from the American Museum of Natural History and the Florida Museum of Natural History using ImageJ (Rasband 2007); measured directly from specimens of Nimravus brachyops and Pogonodon platycopis from John Day Fossil Beds National Monument by J. X. Samuels; measured from photos and specimens of B. loveorum taken by D. Ehret (crown height) and R. Hulbert (mediolateral width); taken from specimens measured previously by G. J. Slater; or taken from measurements reported in the literature (Baskin 1981; Tejada-Flores and Shaw 1984; Berta 1995). Best efforts were taken to ensure that the same measurement was being taken on all specimens. When measurements were taken by other individuals, they were provided with a clear explanation of what measurements were needed, and data was taken only from literature sources that either (1) had a scale bar so measurements could be taken in Image J, or (2) specifically stated that measurements were taken from the enamel/ dentine junction. Although none of the fossil felid species were smaller than approximately 15–20 kg, some of the nimravids, such as Hoplophoneus primaevus (,13–19 kg [Van Valkenburgh 1990]) and Dinictis felina (,17– 20 kg [Van Valkenburgh 1990]) were medium sized. Thus, extinct species were compared with 15 species of extant felids and P. atrox, which range in size from ,15 kg to 433 kg (Table 1). Body masses of extant taxa were compiled from Sunquist and Sunquist (2002), and mass estimates for extinct taxa were compiled from or calculated from information in Legendre and Roth (1988), Van Valkenburgh (1990), Anyonge (1993), Smith

Data Analysis.—Species were first split into three groups: (1) conical-tooth cats, (2) nimravids, and (3) sabertooth cat lineages (including Nimravides). For this analysis, Barbourofelis was not included because there were no confamilials available to measure. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were run on forelimb functional indices of these groups to examine overall differences between them. A homoge-

Results
ANOVA Results.—Results of the ANOVA show that some groups are statistically distinct for all indices (Table 4, Fig. 2). Sabertooth cats had greater radial robustness index (RRI) and lower brachial index (BI) values— indicating greater mechanical advantage— than conical-tooth cats (p 5 0.017 and 0.017, respectively). Olecranon index (OI) and humeral epicondylar index (HEI) were significantly longer (OI) and more robust (HEI) in both groups of sabertooths than in conicaltooth cats (OI: p 5 0.020 nimravids, p 5 .007 sabercats; HEI: p 5 0.024 nimravids, p 5 0.016 sabercats). Humeral robustness index (HRI) was larger in nimravids than conical-tooth cats (p 5 0.041). Paw width index (PAW) showed significant differences between sabercats (p 5 0.003) and conical cats alike (p , 0.001), with nimravids having a much larger value, indicating wider paws overall.
DFA Results and Allometric Trends.—A discriminant functional analysis was performed on the two morphogroups, including all six postcranial functional indices. Only one discriminant function was found, based on PAW, but groups were correctly classified 95.8% of the time (Wilkes l 5 0.345, F 5 41.73, p , 0.001). The discriminant function separated sabertooth morphs with positive scores from conical-tooth morphs with negative scores.
RMA regressions of functional indices relative to body mass show that canine index scales very differently between conical tooth
  neity of variance test confirmed that all groups in this study had similar variances; therefore, possible differences between sub-groups were analyzed using Scheffe ́’s post hoc test in SPSS v. 17.
Secondarily, species were split into two morphogroups: (1) conical-tooth morphs (including Nimravides) and (2) sabertooth morphs. A discriminate function analysis (DFA) was performed on these two groups, using only functional postcranial characters to determine whether they could be separated on the basis of those characters alone. As a tool to visualize the differences between individual species and take tooth crown height into account, a set of bivariate plots were made for each ratio, by setting the forelimb ratio as the independent variable and canine index (canine crown height/canine mediolateral diameter) as the dependent variable.
The effects of size and allometry are important issues for understanding limb robustness. Although functional indices may reduce the effects of size, they do not remove allometry. Thus, a few precautions were taken to ensure that any significant differences were not simply a consequence of allometry. First, the extinct American lion (P. atrox), which has a larger skull length and a larger estimated mass than any sabertooth species used in this analysis, was included in the data set. Second, a reduced major axis regression (RMA) was run in SMATR (Falster et al. 2006) using log mass (or estimated mass) as the x-variable and either canine index or individual functional forelimb indices as the y-variable. These RMA regressions, run on the morphogroups, were performed to test whether size or allometric effects were responsible for any patterns seen in the data. If size did not affect robusticity, these regressions would be predicted to have a slope of zero. Although the masses of extinct

tooth cat. In accordance with this pattern, the smaller sabertooth morphs, D. felina and H. primaevus (,15 kg), are more robust than similarly sized conical-tooth cats. Similar patterns are seen for OI, HEI, HRI, and BI. Paw width (PAW) shows a unique pattern, with conical-tooth morphs and sabertooth morphs having virtually no overlap.
Discussion
As highlighted by the ANOVAs and RMA regressions, sabertooths show more exaggerated prey-killing adaptations, irrespective of predator size. Results from the RMA indicate that size and allometry are affecting both groups of animals, but that the degree of allometry is more or less consistent. This is notable even in the smaller sabertooth species, with distinct differences between the smaller nimravids and the similarly sized conical-tooth cats (,15–20 kg). The medium sized nimravids (e.g., Hoplophoneus occidentalis) show exaggerated traits for large prey specialization, such as more robust bones and larger areas for muscle attachments. This specialization is interesting because it could have two functional implications for prey-killing. First, these medium-sized nimravids may have been using their forelimbs much more extensively than their conical tooth analogs to capture and kill prey, possibly as a measure to protect their long saber canines. Second, they may have been killing larger prey than their conical tooth counterparts (see also
  and sabertooth morphs, with a higher slope for sabertooth morphs than conical-tooth morphs (Table 5, Fig. 3A). However, none of the postcranial indices showed any significant differences in slope between sabertooth morphs and conical-tooth morphs. Sabertooth morphs generally had higher intercepts, indicating that they are more robust overall than conical tooth forms, but they generally have similar scaling (Table 5, Fig. 3B). It is important to note that none of the RMA regressions for the sabertooth group had significant p-values, and the canine index regressions were not significant for either group. This disparate result for sabertooth and conical-tooth cats could be attributed to the monophyly of conical-tooth cats (with the exception of Nimravides), and the polyphyly of sabertooth morphs.
Bivariate Plots.—Bivariate plots show distinctions between conical-tooth cats and sabertooth morphs (Fig. 4A–F). There is a great deal of overlap between the two groups, but one clear difference is that sabertooth morphs seem to come from a more robust starting point than conical-tooth morphs and continue along this robust trajectory, as shown in the RMA regressions. For example, for RRI (Fig. 4A), the least robust sabertooth morph Dinictis felina (,20 kg), shows radial robustness similar to that of pantherines, whereas larger sabertooth morphs, such as Smilodon and Barbourofelis, show radial robustness greater than that of P. atrox, a larger conical-

Additionally, proximal paw width (PAW) was surprisingly large in sabertooth forms, most notably in the nimravids. The dot plot (Fig. 2C) and bivariate plot (Fig. 4C) both show differences in morphospace between cats and nimravids. The proximal paw width has implications for both prey-killing and tree
climbing. Spreading forces out over a wider distance can increase stability in either endeavor, making it easier to latch on to a victim or to climb (Cartmill 1985; Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2009b). It has been suggested that nimravids were skillful climbers (Van Valkenburgh 1985, 1987), a preadaptation that would also have made them adept killers, given that many of the characteristics that make a cat a good climber also make it a skillful grappler (Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2009b).

The bivariate plots indicate some correlative trends between canine and forelimb morphologies. Although noteworthy, these trends are not statistically significant. It appears that dirk-tooth species are more robust than similarly sized scimitar-tooth species. For example, within the Felidae, the dirk-tooth Smilodon gracilis (,70 kg) is more robust than the scimitar-tooth Machairodus or Homotherium crenatidens (,115 kg). Some derived dirk-tooth forms, such as Smilodon fatalis, show exaggerated adaptations for grappling prey with the forelimbs (Schultz and Martin 1970; Gonyea 1976; Anyonge 1996b; Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2010), whereas some scimitartooth forms, such as Homotherium, cluster closer to the living large felids (Fig. 4A–F).
For nimravids, the case is similar. One exception is in RRI (Fig. 4A), where N. brachyops (scimitar-tooth, ,50 kg) is more robust than Hoplophoneus occidentalis (dirk-tooth, ,65 kg), but generally the reverse is true (all other indices). Another interesting nimravid is Pogonodon platycopis. Only humerus measurements were available for this species, but P. platycopis has humeral robustness far greater than any other nimravid, even though the sabers are slightly shorter than those of H. occidentalis (Supplementary Appendix 1).
Some interesting trends in nimravid lineages are illustrated by Nimravus brachyops and Dinictis felina. N. brachyops does not show the extreme paw width of other nimravids (Figs. 2C, 4C). Interestingly, the canine shape in N. brachyops is similar to that in conicaltooth cats (Fig. 4C). Although classified as a scimitar-tooth nimravid, N. brachyops has canines that are shorter and less compressed than in other sabertooths (Martin 1998b). This difference in canine shape is also reflected in the mandibular symphysis, which shows an intermediate stage between conical-tooth cats and carnivores with longer sabers (Therrien 2005). N. brachyops is similar to conical-tooth cats in humeral epicondylar breadth as well (Fig. 4D). Although N. brachyops is a relatively recent nimravid (30–20 Ma), this intermediate condition may be close to the ancestral nimravid condition (Bryant 1996; Peigne ́ 2003) or, alternatively, it may represent an early cursorial adaptation. It suggests both a
more pursuit-based predation strategy and the presence of ecological diversity among nimravids.
Another example of a functional association between canine shape and forelimb strength is Dinictis felina. D. felina is a scimitar-tooth nimravid with canines that are less elongated and compressed than in Hoplophoneus, but slightly more so than in N. brachyops (Martin 1998a). D. felina has PAW values that are intermediate between N. brachyops and species with more saberlike teeth (Figs. 2C, 4C). Also, D. felina’s values for radial robustness, olecranon index, humeral epicondylar index, and humeral robustness are intermediate between those of other nimravids and conical-tooth cats (Fig. 4A,B, D,E, respectively).
This diversity in form suggests a continuum of ecological diversity in sabertooth and conical-tooth felids as well as nimravids. Although as a general rule dirk-tooth forms tend to be more robust than scimitar-tooth forms, there are some exceptions to this. The functional indices examined in this study seem to indicate mosaic evolution of independent characters in scimitar-tooth and dirktooth morphs (e.g., similar HRI in H. serum and S. gracilis, but longer, gracile teeth in S. gracilis; RRI greater in N. brachyops than in H. occidentalis). Differences between these groups may become clearer with larger sample sizes and further analyses.
Dinictis felina and Nimravus brachyops cooccur in the Whitneyan of Nebraska, and Dinictis felina co-occurs with both Hoplophoneus occidentalis and H. primaevus in the Orellan of South Dakota (Martin 1998a,b). Additionally, at the Oligocene-aged John Day Fossil Beds Dinaelurus crassus, Dinictis cyclops, Nimravus, and Pogonodon are all found from the same strata of Turtle Cove E (Albright et al. 2008; J. X. Samuels personal communication 2010), suggestive of niche separation within nimravids.
There are several known fossil localities where conical-, scimitar-, and dirk-tooth cats cooccur, e.g., Rancho La Brea, California, and American Falls, Idaho, where Smilodon fatalis and Homotherium coexisted with the American lion and pumas; Inglis 1A in

Florida has numerous cat species, such as Smilodon gracilis, Xenosmilus hodsonae, the cheetah-like Miracinonyx inexpectatus, a jaguar, and the early puma Puma lacustris.
The dirk-tooth smilodontines appear to be convergent in structure with dirk-tooth Hoplophoneus and Barbourofelis, with exaggerated robustness and high mechanical advantage in the forelimbs. The most parsimonious explanation for this convergence is the presence of exceptionally elongated saber teeth. These teeth would have been efficient killing tools, but they come with some serious physical limitations, such as the possibility of breakage if subjected to mediolateral bending or shearing forces (Van Valkenburgh and Ruff 1987; Slater and Van Valkenburgh 2008). The inability to kill prey by using a chokehold would have to be mitigated by extensive use of the forelimbs to initially restrain prey (Gonyea 1976, 1978; Anyonge 1996b; Turner and Anto ́n 1997; Wroe et al. 2008; MeachenSamuels and Van Valkenburgh 2010).
Lewis and Lague (2010) found that the hind limbs of sabertooth forms do not show the same degree of positive allometric scaling that the forelimbs display, indicating that the forelimbs are more robust than the hind limbs, most likely for prey-killing purposes. Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh (2010) found a similar result when they examined the cortical thickness of the forelimb (humerus) versus the hind limb (femur) of Smilodon fatalis.
One alternative functional explanation for this forelimb convergence in nimravids, felids, and Barbourofelis is that all groups descended from arboreal ancestors that had muscular forelimbs for climbing, because similar adaptations are found in both arboreal felids and large-prey specialists (Gonyea 1978; Cartmill 1985; Meachen-Samuels and Van Valkenburgh 2009b). A previous study suggested that the smaller nimravids were highly arboreal (Van Valkenburgh 1985). A high degree of arboreality seems to be a likely explanation for the low brachial index seen in the extant clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) (Figs. 2F, 4F), because this cat has been known to kill prey in trees (Grassman 2001; Matsuda et al. 2008). Other studies have suggested that
Neofelis may be a modern analog to sabertooth morphs (Christiansen 2006, 2008). Although N. nebulosa shows forelimb morphology converging on sabertooth forms, it is important to note that similar morphology is developed through arboreal specialization, and this must be taken into consideration before any conclusions can be drawn.
Arboreal specialization is less likely for other groups like the smilodontines and for Barbourofelis loveorum because of their short tails and high body masses. A study on arboreal primates found that, among species that walk on branches, as the animal gets larger the tail gets longer to help counterbalance the animal’s weight (Larson and Stern 2006; Lammers and Zurcher 2009). This is certainly the case in the clouded leopard, whose tail is approximately the same length as its head and body (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). An animal as large as Smilodon would certainly have been able to pull its body weight up a tree with its robust forelimb musculature, but it would have had trouble moving around on branches, because balancing would be difficult without a tail at higher masses. Additionally, the largest living cats, lions and tigers, rarely climb as adults (Schaller 1967, 1972), perhaps because their large body mass makes climbing difficult or dangerous. A similar trend of elongated canines and robust forelimbs has also been found in the metatherian sabertooth predator Thylacosmilus atrox. This sabertooth carnivore has elongated, laterally compressed canines, and also has robust, welldeveloped forelimbs that are thought to have been used for extensive prey grappling (Argot 2004). The observed similarity in forelimb morphology among sabertooth predators, particularly those with thinner, extremely elongated canines, suggests that a common solution evolved to deal with the limitations of these teeth.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that the most extreme forelimb robustness is independently associated with lengthening and compression of the canine teeth in felids, nimravids, and Barbourofelis. Most likely this is a secondary adaptation in response to, or in conjunction

with, increased specialization and fragility of their saber teeth. The most extreme examples of tooth elongation (e.g., Smilodon fatalis and Barbourofelis loveorum) are some of the most derived members of their lineages and have extremely specialized forelimbs. Many subtle differences exist between nimravids, Barbourofelis, and sabertooth felids, but these groups clearly converge upon similar morphologies (Meehan and Martin 2003). The forelimbs of dirk-tooth nimravids, Barbourofelis, and dirktooth felids, as well as the scimitar-tooth forms, show considerable morphological similarities. There appears to be a graduated continuum of forelimb morphologies that correspond to tooth morphologies and likely predatory behavior in nimravids and felids, with the most extreme sabers and most robust forelimbs associated with a hyper-ambush predatory style (Gonyea 1976; Martin 1998b; Wroe et al. 2008). The cooccurrence of numerous nimravid species, and later felid species, with differing tooth and forelimb structures reflect ecological diversity and niche separation among sabertooth predators.
