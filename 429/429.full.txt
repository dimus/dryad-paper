Abstract.—Following (1) the large-scale molecular phylogeny of seed plants based on plastid rbcL gene sequences (published in 1993 by Chase et al., Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 80:528-580) and (2) the 18S nuclear phylogeny of flowering plants (published in 1997 by Soltis et al., Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 84:1-49), we present a phylogenetic analysis of flowering plants based on a second plastid gene, atpB, analyzed separately and in combination with rbcL sequences for 357 taxa. Despite some discrepancies, the atpB-based phylogenetic trees were highly congruent with those derived from the analysis of rbcL and 18S rDNA, and the combination of atpB and rbcL DNA sequences (comprising ~3000 base pairs) produced increased bootstrap support for many major sets of taxa. The angiosperms are divided into two major groups: noneudicots with inaperturate or uniaperturate pollen (monocots plus Laurales, Magnoliales, Piperales, Ceratophyllales, and AmborellaceaeNymphaeaceae-Illiciaceae) and the eudicots with triaperturate pollen (particularly asterids and rosids). Based on rbcL alone and atpB/rbcL combined, the noneudicots (excluding Ceratophyllum) are monophyletic, whereas in the atpB trees they form a grade. Ceratophyllum is sister to the rest of angiosperms with rbcL alone and in the combined atpB/rbcL analysis, whereas with atpB alone, Amborellaceae, Nymphaeaceae, and Illiciaceae/Schisandraceae form a grade at the base of the angiosperms. The phylogenetic information at each codon position and the different types of substitutions (observed transitions and transversions in the trees vs. pairwise comparisons) were examined; taking into account their respective consistency and retention indices, we demonstrate that third-codon positions and transitions are the most useful characters in these phylogenetic reconstructions. This study further demonstrates that phylogenetic analysis of large matrices is feasible. [Angiosperm; atpB; complex phylogenies; large molecular data sets; rbcL.]

new phylogenetic hypothesis was being published every day, most of these being based on DNA data. Like other groups of organisms (and perhaps even more so at suprafamilial levels), flowering plants have been the subject of many phylogenetic studies. Despite this emphasis, many as-

In 1993, 42 plant systematists published an analysis of nucleotide sequences of the plastid gene rbcL, including 499 taxa representing what was hoped would be all major lineages of seed plants (Chase et al., 1993). These authors discussed many problems concerning the classification and evolution of angiosperms as well as some aspects of conducting phylogenetic analyses of large data sets. Some workers accepted most of the relationships observed in these cladograms, whereas others argued that the accuracy of these trees was unproven and that many of the relationships were too preposterous to be seriously entertained (e.g., Takhtajan, 1997). Others maintained that the analysis itself was flawed; the trees illustrated were only a few of the thousands that existed at that tree length, and still shorter trees were likely (Rice et al., 1998). Reanalyzing the 499 taxa matrix using several years of computer time, Rice et al. (1998) found shorter trees, although the major clades depicted in the 1993 paper remained unchanged.
Concomitantly, researchers using 18S rDNA expanded the coverage of angiosperms from that of earlier studies (Hamby and Zimmer, 1992; Nickrent and Soltis, 1995). This research resulted in the analysis of Soltis et al. (1997b), which included 223 taxa covering all major lineages of flowering plants. The 18S rDNA and rbcL topologies are highly concordant; virtually all of the same major clades and subclades are retrieved by both genes, although the branching order of major clades sometimes differs. Neither the 18S rDNA nor the rbcL analysis provided internal support (as estimated by the bootstrap/jackknife) for the spine of the tree. Indeed, the 1993 rbcL paper contained no estimates of internal support for the large analysis; it did, however, contain a smaller analysis of the eudicots, for which "decay" values (e.g., Bremer support; Bremer, 1988) were produced, and from these it was clear that little support existed for major clades within the eudicots (see Chase and Albert, 1998, for a bootstrap analysis). Chase et al. (1995) demonstrated a similar pattern of low support for major clades and higher-level relationships within the monocots.
Taxonomically equivalent data sets of 18S rDNA and rbcL (Soltis et al., 1997a, 1999) as well as for 18S rDNA, rbcL, and atpB (Chase and Cox, 1998; Soltis et al., 1998; Hoot et al., 1995, 1997, 1999; Hoot & Douglas, 1998) have been constructed and compared across the angiosperms and for certain large subgroups of flowering plants. Significantly, combining these data sets has resulted in a higher number of strongly supported clades and greater resolution than have analyses of the individual data sets.
Chase and Cox (1998) examined startingtree lengths relative to the shortest trees ultimately found in parsimony searches for seven matrices each of 141 taxa for rbcL, atpB, and 18S rDNA (each used alone, in pairs, and all three combined). They found that the differences between the length of starting trees and the shortest trees ultimately obtained was greatly decreased in all combined-gene compared with single-gene matrices. This was also one of the factors responsible for the decreased analysis time for the combined data sets compared with that for the individual data sets. Parsimony searches involving combined matrices actually ran to completion, whereas none of the searches using individual matrices or the pairwise combinations was ever completed (Chase and Cox, 1998; Soltis et al., 1998).
Several studies indicated that a second plastid gene, atpB, would be a good candidate for comparison and combination with rbcL (Ritland and Clegg, 1987; Hoot et al., 1995). The rate of atpB evolution appeared to be similar to that of rbcL, and atpB was described as being easy to amplify and sequence with universal PCR primers (Hoot et al., 1995). Moreover, the atpB gene has been used successfully in phylogenetic studies at family and higher levels (Hoot et al., 1997, 1999; Hoot and Douglas, 1998; Bayer et al., 1999; Chase et al., 1999).
The genes coding for atpB and rbcL are both located in the large single-copy region of the plastid genome; their coding sequences are on opposite strands separated by an intergenic spacer of —600-800 base pairs (bp; Savolainen et al., 1997). Different evolutionary constraints are likely to be involved because the two genes code for distinct enzymatic functions: rbcL codes for the

large subunit of the ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase, a free enzyme in the stroma, whereas atpB codes for the beta subunit of the ATP synthase, which is bound to the thylakoid-membrane (Zurawski et al., 1982). Consequently, atpB and rbcLdata represent independent data sets for which comparative analyses should be suitable. Because both are part of the same nonrecombining piece of DNA, they should have the same history.

We present here the results of phyloge-
netic analyses using matrices for these two
plastid genes, atpB and rbcL (~3,000 bp total), 50°C, 1 min of extension at 72°C, and 7 min analyzed separately and in combination,
for 357 taxa (—250 families) representing all
major lineages of angiosperms indicated by
the large rbcL and 18S rDNA studies (Chase
et al., 1993; Soltis et al., 1997b). We also ex-
plore more thoroughly the substitution pat-

present in both rbcL and atpB.

The atpB gene was amplified by the same protocol as above but using primers 2F (5'-TATGAGA ATCAATCCTACTACTTCT-3') and 1494R (5'-TCAGT ACACA A AGA TTT A AGGTCA T -3'; Hoot et al., 1995). Bovine serum albumin (0.40% w/v) was added to the PCR mix because it is useful for recalcitrant DNA samples, particularly those obtained from herbarium specimens (Savolainen et al., 1995). Amplification products were purified by using Magic minicolumns (Promega, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's proto-

however, and in several instances we had to reextract DNAs. Whenever possible, we used the same species or another species from the same genus, but in some cases we used another genus from the same family (Appendix 1; see Kellogg and Linder, 1995, for some discussion on pitfalls of combining taxa). Our final sampling set comprises 357 species (714 gene sequences) representing 261 families (sensu Watson and Dallwitz, 1991; version 1997 is available on the web at http://www.keil.ukans.edu/delta) or 250 families according to a recent reclassification of the angiosperms that is based largely on the results obtained from molecular phylogenetic studies (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group [APG], 1998). We followed the APG treatment for familial and ordinal circumpscriptions and names.

These reactions were then purified by simple precipitation. The resuspended sample was run on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 373A or 377 automated sequencer according to the manufacturer's protocols. Both strands were sequenced by using the amplification primers and the following additional internal primers: 636F (5'-GCGTTG G A G A G A T C G T T T C T 3 ' ) a n d 724R ( 5 ' TCGCA TGT ACCTGCAGT AGC-3' for all dicots a n d 5'-TCGCA TGT ACCYGCAGT TGC-3' for monocots) for rbcL, and 611F (5'A ACGT ACTCGTGA AGGA A A TGA TCT -3') and 766R (5'-TAACATCTCGGAAATATTC CGCCAT-3') for atpB (Hoot et al., 1995).

ATG-3'), 385R (5'-GCGCAGATCTATGAA TAGGAGACGT-3', Hoot et al., 1995) and 1186R (5'-TGTCCTGA AGTTCTTTGT A AC GTTG-3', Hoot et al., 1995) were used to sequence atpB from gymnosperms, which were used as the outgroups.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Sequence data were analyzed by using various versions of the PAUP* package (P AUP 4.0 d50-d63, by special arrangement with David Swofford). Most-parsimonious trees were obtained through use of the following strategies: (1) For each gene separately, 100 replicates of RANDOM taxon additions were performed, using equal weights and tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping, with only five trees held at each step (NCHUCK = 5). The trees collectively found in these 100 replicates were then used as starting trees for new searches utilizing nearest-neighborinterchange (NNI) swapping until 3,000 trees at this length were found (MAXTREES = 3,000). (2) When both genes were analyzed together, the procedure described above was applied, but with 350 replicates of RANDOM taxon additions and holding 10 trees at each step (NCHUCK = 10); the trees collected in these replicates were then swapped on again by using TBR with only 10 trees held at each step (NCHUCK = 10) until 200 best trees were found (MAXTREES = 200). These latter trees were then finally used as starting trees in a round of NNI swapping until completion. Each of these searches typically required ~ 1,000 hrs of CPU time for an Ultrasparc Enterprise 3000 Sun Microsystems (5 X 250 MHz, 1 GB of RAM). Taking substantially more time, similar results were obtained with a Power Macintosh with 32 MB of RAM; searches on this machine lasted more than a month, even for the combined matrix of both genes. This basic search strategy has been commonly used with large data sets and has been shown to be reasonably efficient (see Chase et al., 1993; Soltis et a l ,
1997b; Chase and Cox, 1998).
Internal support was evaluated by using bootstrap resampling (Felsenstein, 1985). For each matrix (singly or in combination), 1,000 bootstrap replicates were performed, using the NNI swapping algorithm with
simple addition of taxa and only 10 trees held at each step (random deletion with replacement as implemented in bootstrapping eliminates the need to perform randomization of taxon entry order; the deletion/substitution of characters alters the distance calculations, thus randomly altering the taxon-addition patterns). Each bootstrap set (1,000 replicates) typically required 6 days using a Power Macintosh (7300/166, 32 MB of RAM).
MacClade 3.04 (Maddison and Maddison, 1992) was used to evaluate codon frequencies and to calculate various statistics (i.e., consistency index [CI] and retention index [RI] for each codon position, excluding autapomorphies for the former), and to map the morphological and chemical characters of Nandi et al. (1998) onto the combined trees. MEGA 1.0.1 (Kumar et al., 1993) was used to compare the molecular evolution of atpB and rbcL. MEGA provides widely used calculations (e.g., transitions, transversions, and so forth) that we wished to compare with tree-based values. For this purpose, 40 taxa were randomly chosen (the 40 first taxa in alphabetical order) and analyzed by pairwise comparisons without correction for multiple substitutions. LI93 also was used to calculate unbiased rates of synonymous, nonsynonymous, and overall substitutions, based on the same pairwise comparisons as above (Li, 1993). For comparison with distance-based calculations, we also calculated the number of inferred transitions and transversions (as well as their CIs and RIs), using a step matrix in P AUP* in which transversions were weighted "1" and transitions "0." From the number of transversions and their collective CI and RI, we calculated the number of transitions and their CI and RI.
We calculated the CI and RI for transversions, transitions, and each codon position to evaluate the hypothesis that frequency is a valid basis on which to implement relative weighting (i.e., that rarer events would be more reliable in phylogeny reconstruction than more frequent ones). We used RI as the criterion to discuss relative information content of different character types (Farris, 1989). CI measures overall homoplasy, whereas RI takes into account the maximum number of changes that could have occurred on an unresolved bush and

thus measures amount of structure (or phylogenetic signal) retained on optimal trees (Farris, 1989).
To compare the distribution of starting tree lengths with the length of optimal trees, we followed the same procedure as Chase and Cox (1998): The lengths of 5,000 starting trees (stepwise addition with random taxa order, no swapping, as implemented in PAUP*) were recorded for each data set (atpB and rbcL alone and in combination) and plotted as the percentage by which they were longer than most-parsimonious trees (i.e., those we found in each of the full heuristic searches after extensive swapping).
RESULTS
Molecular Evolution and Patterns of Change
Sequences of both genes were aligned easily by eye; the combined matrix contained 1,408 characters for rbcL (1,428 bp minus the length of the IF primer) and 1,447 for atpB (1,497 bp minus the length of the 2F and 1494R primers). There were no insertions or deletions (except for some rare exceptions in atpB; these insertions were simply omitted from the matrix because they occurred only in single taxa at the 3' end of the gene). The number of variable and potentially parsimony-informative characters found in each data set, the number and length of the most-parsimonious trees obtained, and the CIs and RIs for each of the analyses performed are presented in Table 1. Data sets are available at the Systematic Biology Web site (www.utexas. edu/ftp/ depts/ systbiol /).
Branch lengths, CIs, and RIs are shown for each partition (genes alone or in combination) by codon position (Fig. 1); most of the variation (75% and 71% for atpB and rbcL, respectively) is at third positions as
previously reported (Chase et al., 1995; Hoot et al., 1995). Second positions experienced the fewest steps (10% in both genes), and first positions were intermediate (15% and 19% for atpB and rbcL, respectively). Whereas CIs were greater at the second positions (0.28 and 0.29, respectively) and less at third positions (0.11 for both), RIs were similar for the first (0.48 and 0.46) and second (0.46 and 0.44) positions, with the highest values at the third positions (0.75 and 0.59, respectively). In contrast, Naylor and Brown (1997,1998) found RI was lowest for third-position sites in animal mitochondrial genes. Using computer-generated data sets, Hauser and Boyajian (1997) demonstrated that RI was primarily influenced by the percentage of characters that change per node but was only weakly correlated with the number of taxa. Here, in the atpB/rbcL tree, the average rate of change (number of steps /number of variable sites) was 7.74 for first, 5.35 for second, and 20.09 for thirdcodon positions. We can thus infer that the only factor responsible for the higher RI of the third-codon positions is their distribution within the tree.
Table 2 compares the rates of synonymous, nonsynonymous, and overall substitution for atpB and rbcL. As previously reported by Hoot et al. (1995), the overall rate of substitution is slightly higher for rbcL than atpB. This contrasts with the tree length, which is shorter for rbcL than for atpB (12,772 vs. 12,979, Table 1; for contradictory results, see Hoot et al., 1995, 1999). Tree-based estimates of sequence change are therefore at odds with those calculated a priori, in the absence of a topology, by using pairwise comparisons. Synonymous versus nonsynonymous sites do not differ significantly between rbcL and atpB.
Transition/transversion ratios (ts/tv) for atpB and rbcL also differ. We calculated the

ts/tv ratio on one of the trees obtained from the analysis of the combined rbcL and atpB data set: for atpB ts/tv is 2.09, whereas for rbcL it is 1.65 (Table 3); similar ts/tv ratios were found by Hoot et al. (1995). Using instead the shortest trees from each of the

separate analyses affects only the second decimal place. Figure 2 shows the percentage of divergence versus the number of transitions and transversions in pairwise comparisons (independently from the recovered trees). The atpB gene exhibits the greater number of transitions, which agrees with the ts/tv ratio we calculated based on the trees (see Table 3).
CIs and RIs for transitions and transversions (Table 3) exhibit a pattern similar to that for codon-based change. Transitions had slightly lower CIs than transversions (tsatpB=0.12andtsrbcL=0.13vs. tvatpB= 0.17 and tv rbcL = 0.15), but the RIs for transitions were higher than those for transversions (ts atpB = 0.64 and ts rbcL = 0.62 vs. tv atpB = 0.47 and tv rbcL = 0.49). Thus, the much more numerous transitions performed better (had higher RIs) than the rarer transversions.
Phylogenetic Patterns and Support
Neither of the two genes individually has any striking differences in the number of groups receiving bootstrap support (Figs. 3-6), but the combined matrix clearly pro-

vides more resolution and robust relationships than the individual matrices. Figures 3 and 4 present topologies found when both genes were analyzed separately and in combination, respectively (for composition of the named clades, see Figs. 5 and 6; the names of families and ordinal groups follow those recommended by the APG, 1998). Figures 5a-p present one of the 3,000 shortest trees found for atpB and rbcL analyzed separately (see Table 1; because of memory limitations, only 3,000 trees were kept; however, more trees at this length exist). Figures 6a-h present one of the 8,600 shortest trees found in the analysis of combined data (see Table 1 for tree statistics). In all figures, arrows indicate the branches that are not found in the strict consensus of the shortest trees.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of starting tree lengths in comparison with the length of the optimal trees for atpB and rbcL alone and in combination. The shape of the curves is not smooth but rather jagged: This
could indicate that suboptima occur locally (e.g., starting atpB trees at length 13,143 or 13,146 are more likely to be built than at 13,144 steps; the former found 77 and 76 trees at each, respectively, vs. only 62 for 13,144; see Fig. 7). The combined data set produced the greatest number of starting trees nearest to the shortest tree length (the atpB/rbcL curve is left-skewed compared with atpB or rbcL alone), which explains why combined matrices ran to completion and required less swapping time to reach optima than did the analyses involving single genes (Chase and Cox, 1998; Soltis et a l , 1998). Because we set a tree limit in each case (combined vs. single-genes), the faster analysis time exhibited for the combined matrix is strictly a factor of the tree lengths (starting vs. final), rather than the number of starting trees.
Apart from the above considerations of molecular evolution, atpB and rbcL also differ slightly in the phylogenetic patterns inferred. We consider the trees produced by

We are not suggesting that bootstrap support is infallible—spurious groupings with high bootstrap values are well documented (see Lecointre et al., 1993)—but for Lecointre et al. this occurred concomitantly with long branch attraction and sparse taxon sampling. We will not discuss in de-
For descriptive purposes, we have divided the flowering plants into two major groups: (1) noneudicots with inaperturate or uniaperturate pollen (monocotyledons plus Laurales, Magnoliales, Piperales, Ceratophyllales, and the AmborellaceaeNymphaeaceae-Illiciaceae group; see Figs. 5a-d, 6a,b) and (2) eudicots with triaperturate pollen (as defined by Chase et al., 1993; see Figs. 5e-p, 6c-h). The most obvious exceptions to the monosulcate pollen characteristic of the former group are Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae, which have tricolpate pollen, but the pollen of these families is known to have been derived in a nonhomologous manner (Huynh, 1976).
NONEUDICOTS
The noneudicots comprise woody (e.g., Magnoliales and Laurales), herbaceous (e.g., most Chloranthaceae and Piperales), and aquatic (e.g., Ceratophyllaceae and Nymphaeaceae) taxa. Although many studies (Soltis et al., 1997b; Nandi et al., 1998), as well as the atpB tree presented here, have shown the noneudicots to be paraphyletic, this informal name is useful for describing a largely monophyletic group (if Ceratophyllum is excluded) recognized here in the rbcL and combined trees. The monocots are embedded within the noneudicots in all trees (Figs. 5a,b, 6a). In this study, the monocots have not been sampled extensively but are represented by a taxonomically diverse spectrum (Figs. 5c,d, 6b). We refer readers to Duvall et al. (1993), Soreng and Davis
(1998), and Chase et al. (1995, 2000) for broader analyses of the monocots. However, both atpB and rbcL provide highly similar topologies, with Acorus being sister to the remaining monocots (Figs. 5c,d, 6b).
A major difference between atpB and rbcL concerns the monophyly of the noneudicots (excluding Ceratophyllum). In the rbcL tree (Fig. 5b; Chase et al., 1993; Qiu et al., 1993), the noneudicots are monophyletic, as they

bined); we stress, however, that no strongly supported and incongruent patterns were obtained. The atpB tree compares well with the rbcL trees of Chase et al. (1993); only the topologies with weak bootstrap support (<50%) vary (Qiu et al., 1993; Chase and Cox, 1998; Nandi et al., 1998).
with atpB (Fig. 5a), 18S rDNA (Soltis et al., 1997b), and 18S rDNA/rbd (Soltis et al., 1997a), the noneudicots form a grade, with the root attached between Amborella and all other angiosperms. Because the bootstrap does not provide support >50% for either view, we argue that neither of these results

In both cases, the combined tree favors the rbcL pattern, although there is <50% bootstrap support for the monophyly of Aristolochiaceae (Fig. 6a); support is greater for the position of Acorus alone as sister to the rest of the monocots: 86% for the monophyly of the monocots excluding Ceratophyllum, and 83% for the monophyly of the monocots minus Acorus (Fig. 6b).

6e-h). The same basal grade was found in previous analyses of the "lower" eudicots based on three genes—these two plastid genes plus 18S rDNA (Soltis et al., 1998; Hoot et al., 1999).
In the separate atpB and rbcL trees, the spine of the lower eudicot portion of the tree receives no support >50%, whereas in the combined analysis three large clades are supported (Fig. 6c): (1) the dichotomy that separates Ranunculales (including Euptelea) from all other eudicots (67% for eudicots excluding Ranunculales, 94% for the monophyly of Ranunculales); (2) the eudicots excluding Ranunculales, Proteales, and Sabiaceae (69%); and (3) the core eudicots (91%, just above Trochodendraceae). Ranunculales and core eudicots are more highly supported (97% and 100%, respectively) in a study of basal eudicots with more extensive sampling for Ranunculales (Hoot et al., 1999). Other notable relationships that receive increased bootstrap sup-
port in our combined atpB/rbcL analysis are the monophyly of Nelumbonaceae/[Proteaceae/Platanaceae] (<50% in both atpB and rbcL alone, 60% in the combined trees), Gunneraceae/Myrothamnaceae (<50% in atpB, 57% in rbcL, 80% in the combined), and Buxaceae/Didymelaceae (71% in atpB, 84% in rbcL, and 100% in the combined).
Two groupings actually lose support in the combined tree over that in one of the individual trees: the clade consisting of Platanaceae/Proteaceae (95% in atpB, <50% in rbcL, 84% in the combined), and the monophyly of Ranunculaceae (90% in rbcL, <50% in atpB, 78% in the combined). Alternative patterns found in the individual analyses are not supported by the bootstrap, but apparently these destabilize the combined analysis, resulting in slightly decreased bootstrap percentages. Even in this situation it would be difficult to argue that this decrease in support is attributable to "hard" incongruence (Seelanan et al., 1997);

rather, we suggest that it is due to the simple addition of an unclear pattern in one gene to a clear one in the other, resulting in less support in the combined analysis. With three genes combined (atpB/rbcL/18S rDNA), these two clades, Platanaceae/Proteaceae and Ranunculaceae, are each strongly supported (Soltis et al, 1998; Hoot et al, 1999).
All three data sets provide evidence for a monophyletic Saxifragales (Figs. 5e,f, 6c), but in the rbcL tree, Geraniaceae are embedded within this order near Paeoniaceae. This is most likely a result of the sampling used here; in the Chase et al. (1993) rbcL tree with greater sampling, Geraniaceae appeared with the group here named Geraniales (Fig. 6f). The position of Paeoniaceae within Saxifragales is highly unstable and has little support for any particular placement (but see Soltis et al., 1997b, 1999; Soltis and Soltis, 1998, for relationships in Saxifragales). The relationship of Saxifragales to the other ma-
jor clades is also unstable, mostly because of the short branches along the spine of the tree (Fig. 6c). As in Hoot et al. (1999), Soltis and
Soltis (1998), and Soltis et al. (1999), the various members of the Hamamelidaceae represented here (Corylopsis, Hamamelis, Disanthus) are found in a clade consisting of Saxifragales and other assorted rosids.
Similarly, all three data sets support an expanded Caryophyllales (74% in atpB, 84% in rbcL, and 97% in the combined; Figs. 5g,h, 6d), but their placement relative to the rosids (including Saxifragales and Vitaceae) and asterids has bootstrap values <50% in all three analyses. The expanded Caryophyllales includes a core clade consisting of Amaranthaceae, Aizoaceae, Cactaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Molluginaceae, Nyctaginaceae, a n d Phytolaccaceae. A clade of Droseraceae, Plumbaginaceae, Polygonaceae, and Nepenthaceae is also found in all three trees but exhibits only low support in the combined analysis (67%; Fig. 6d). Many of the relationships within both core Caryophyllales and this second clade are also well supported, but additional taxa not included here are also found to be related to Caryophyllales s.l.

for 357 taxa. The tree length is 25,936 steps, CI = 0.14, and RI = 0.56. Arrows indicate branches collapsing in the strict consensus tree of 2,000 shortest trees. The numbers of steps are indicated above the branches, and bootstrap values >50% are indicated below the branches. Because of its size, the tree has been broken into eight parts: (a) noneudicots, (b) monocots, (c) eudicots, (d) caryophyllids, (e) eurosids I, (f) eurosids II, (g) asterids, (h) euasterids. Suprageneric nomenclature follows that published by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).

Geraniales are placed as sister to the eurosid II clade but without bootstrap support >50% (Fig. 6f). The other orders of eurosid II also receive support from these analyses (Figs. 5k,l, 6f): Brassicales (68%, 78%, 99%), Malvales (84%, <50%, 97%), Myrtales (93%, 90%, 100%), and Sapindales (85%, <50%, 100%). Many other relationships within the eurosid I and II clades also are well supported (for example, nearly all dichotomies in Brassicales, Cucurbitales, Fabales, Fagales, Geraniales,
Myrtales, Oxalidales, Rosales, and Sapindales receive bootstrap support >50%).
Aster ids
An expanded asterid clade (Asteridae sensu Olmstead et al., 1992) is recovered from analysis of all three matrices. Broad analysis of 18S rDNA similarly revealed an expanded Asteridae, although some analyses showed Caryophyllales embedded in Ericales, within Asteridae s.l. (Soltis et al., 1997b). In the combined trees, this expanded asterid clade is strongly supported (92%; Fig. 6g). Cornales (52%, 74%, 96%) and Ericales (<50%, 72%, 97%) together

clades. Although patterns within Cornales are fairly well supported, those within Ericales are not. Cornales should also include Grubbiaceae, Loasaceae, and probably Hydrostachydaceae (Xiang et al., 1993; Hempel et al., 1995; Morton et al., 1996), but no additional families have been found to be members of Ericales since Morton et al. (1996).
Within the euasterids (Figs. 5o,p, 6h), there are two orders of uncertain relationships: Garryales, in which Oncotheca may not be a member (the rest have weak support as a clade: 52%, not found, 55%) and Aquifoliales (52%, not found, 55%). The monophyly of the latter and euasterid II has low bootstrap support (51% in the combined analysis). Support for euasterid II (62% in the combined trees) and the relationships therein are almost all weak (Fig. 6h); only Apiales {75%, 75%, 99%) and
52%, 60%). Relationships within Gentianales and Solanales appear to be well resolved, whereas those within Lamiales are generally unclear. Within Lamiales, only the monophyly of all families (excluding Oleaceae) receive strong bootstrap support (91%, <50%, 91%).
DISCUSSION
The trees derived from analysis of a combined rbcL/atpB data set are a marked improvement in terms of support for the terminal groups identified, mostly defined as orders here and elsewhere (APG, 1998). This represents one of the first phylogenetic analyses that has dealt with combined gene matrices for such wide taxonomic sampling. Overall, the phylogenetic relationships observed with atpB compare extremely well with those of rbcL; they are

The former also has more numerous variable sites (which are more important in pairwise comparisons than in tree-based methods for estimating substitution rates), but the atpB trees are longer than those from rbcL (see Hoot et a l , 1995, 1999, for differing results).

FIGURE 7. Distribution of starting tree length for both atpB and rbcL data sets alone and in combination. The percentage longer than the most-parsimonious trees was calculated by computing the length of 5,000 replicates of random taxa addition without swapping (i.e., starting trees) in comparison with the length of trees found in each full heuristic search (i.e., optima reached after extensive swapping). Median values are 1.49% longer for rbcL, 1.25% longer for atpB, and 0.82% longer for atpB/rbcL combined. Arrows indicate the length of the trees when the single genes are optimized onto the combined topology (best topology); swapping below these limits leads to ever-greater underestimates (trees that are shorter than the optimum for the combined data set).
deserving of explanation as is homology" (Siddall and Kluge, 1997:317). Homoplasy is evidence, and the more evidence that is available, the more accurate is the resulting tree. Increased homoplasy (i.e., lower CI) does not necessarily mean a weaker signal and a lower RI.
It is not rate that should be of interest, but rather how "decisive" a data set is (Goloboff, 1996; Davis et al., 1998). Similar ideas have emerged in other studies: Analyzing mitochondrial genes in vertebrates, Zardoya and Meyer (1996:939) stated that "performance of genes in recovering the expected . . . trees seems to be not strongly dependent on their rate of evolution and concomitant saturation processes"; they stressed that density of lineage-initiation events in time and completeness of taxon representation aremore important factors thanthe overall rate of gene evolution. To detect ancient phyletic radiations, our data indicate that using the more rapidly evolving genes would be more appropriate than using the more slowly evolving regions, which are unlikely to contain much evidence of a rapid radiation.
Not all genes or sequence regions contain the same strength of signal for the same
monophyletic groups. This is obvious here; for some clades it is rbcL that contains the strongest signal (e.g., bootstrap of 64% for the monophyly of Magnoliales, 90% for Chloranthaceae, 59% for the monocots), whereas for others it is atpB (e.g., bootstrap of 94% for the monophyly of Canellaceae/ Winteraceae, 68% for Laurales); Soltis et al. (1998) and Bayer et al. (1999) give a detailed analysis of the variation in signal for these genes for different clades. Thus, each separate matrix has an heterogeneous pattern of support, and no overall measure of matrix signal or rate is adequate to predict whether a specific group will receive high bootstrap support.
Information Content in Codon Position and Substitution Type
If the use of equally weighted analyses does not appear to be efficient at detecting a clear set of relationships (Huelsenbeck and Hillis, 1993; Hillis et al., 1994), many authors have used some form of relative weighting in the hope of improving resolution (see Albert et al., 1993; Manhart, 1994; Allard and Carpenter, 1996; Nandi et al., 1998). Our results indicate that simple down-weighting or omission of third positions or transitions (as is usually performed in weighted parsimony) is an oversimplification and may lead to loss of resolution and support. Thus, downweighting or eliminating third positions as a class is unwarranted; in fact, the reverse—giving greater weight to third positions—appears to be more appropriate. For example, even though their variation is much more frequent (75% and 71% of the variable positions in atpB and rbcL, respectively, are third positions), the RI of third positions was higher than those for the first and second positions. Yang (1996) reached this same conclusion, using mitochondrial coding sequences for hominoids, and added that the notion of saturation appeared to depend on analytical method. Similarly, Lewis et al. (1997:377), using rbcL sequences in basal embryophytes, found that "the presence of signal in third codon positions . . . means that definitions of saturation based on pairwise comparisons of sequences inadequately assess phylogenetic signal." With respect to codon positions on the rbcL and

third) were invariant, whereas others changed many times: first positions up to 43 and 102 times, second positions up to 63 and 67 times, and third positions up to 78 and 114 times for atpB and rbcL, respectively. As stated by Olmstead et al. (1998), most studies have estimated means and, unfortunately, have ignored variance when comparing rates of genes and coding positions.
Ts/tv weighting is probably the most common form of weighting because it can be used with coding and noncoding regions alike; transitions are often down-weighted because of their higher frequency and thus greater attendant homoplasy (see Allard and Carpenter, 1996). For atpB and rbcL, we determined both the frequencies as well as CI and RI for each type of substitution. Transitions (calculated on the trees) were more frequent (1.65 times for rbcL and 2.09 times for atpB; see Table 3), but their CIs were close to that of transversions (i.e., homoplasy for both types of substitution was similar), whereas the RIs for the more frequent transitions were actually higher, the phylogenetic signal of transitions was stronger. We are convinced that the results obtained here are unbiased by the use of Fitch parsimony (Fitch, 1971), and several workers have found that parsimonious trees derived from transversion weighting did not differ from those obtained with the data equally weighted (e.g., Allard and Carpenter, 1996; Hoot and Douglas, 1998). With respect to our data, the much higher internal support produced by the combined matrices in which nearly three-fourths of the variability could be attributed to third positions and two-thirds to transitions demonstrates that these most frequent categories of change can produce robust estimates of evolutionary relationships.
Root of the Angiosperms
In all phylogenetic analyses of morphological data, the noneudicots formed a grade, not a clade (Donoghue and Doyle, 1989; Loconte and Stevenson, 1991; Nandi et al., 1998; Hoot et al., 1999), but here with rbcL alone (as in Chase et al., 1993) and with rbcL/atpB combined, they (excluding Ceratophyllum) form a clade that is sister to the eu-
rDNA/rbcL and 18S rDNA trees (Soltis et al., 1997a, 1997b), as well as in trees based on three genes (Soltis et al., 1998; Hoot et al., 1999), the noneudicots also formed a grade. In general, the traits of the noneudicots have been assumed to be plesiomorphic for the angiosperms (largely because we have all learned that these are the "archaic" or "primitive" angiosperms), and so they have been coded in such a way that monophyly was precluded. For example, in the matrix of Nandi et al. (1998), no outgroups for the angiosperms were used, and so it would have been impossible to view binary data as forming mutual synapomorphies; one character has to be plesiomorphic by default if the other is derived. However, if all or some portion of the noneudicots and the eudicots are sister taxa, as in the combined atpB/rbcL trees, then some proportion of eudicot traits could equally well be viewed as plesiomorphic for the angiosperms.
There are two major categories of noneudicots, which were referred to as magnoliid I and II in Nandi et al. (1998). Magnoliid I (= eumagnoliids) comprises monocotyledons plus Laurales, Magnoliales, and Piperales and perhaps Chloranthaceae and Canellaceae/Winteraceae. Non-DNA characters that are frequent in eumagnoliid families (and perhaps are synapomorphies) are the presence of asarone, gibacin, licarin A, veraguensin, liriodenine, and indole alkaloids; rodor tube-shaped epicuticular waxes; trimery in the calyx (and in the androecium); successive microsporogenesis; perisperm (or nucellar-derived storage tissue), expanded stamens, and endotestal crystals (see details in Nandi et al., 1998). Many of these characters are polymorphic within the taxa in which they occur, and others are poorly sampled, but the list of possible synapomorphies is longer and more diverse than for many clades of eudicots. These features are all either absent or rare characters in eudicots, and it is likely that at least some of these are synapomorphies for the eumagnoliids. Magnoliid II contains only Amborellaceae, Austrobaileyaceae, Cabombaceae, Illiciaceae, Nymphaeaceae, and Schisandraceae. These Magnoliid
II families are the focus of controversy because in various phylogenetic studies they

 2000 SA VOLAINEN ET AL.—PHYLOGENETICS OF FLOWERING PLANTS 341
occupy different positions, including being positioned at the root within the angiosperms (making them paraphyletic). Magnoliid II are monophyletic for rbcL (Chase et al., 1993; Qiu et al., 1993; this paper), rbcL/morphology (Nandi et al., 1998), and rbcL/atpB combined (this paper); they are paraphyletic with atpB (this paper) and according to combined analyses based on three genes (Hoot et al., 1999) and 18S rDNA (Soltis et al., 1997b). They also share paraor tetracytic stomata and expanded stamen connectives with the magnoliid I noneudicots. Magnoliid II have unfused carpels filled with mucilage as potential synapomorphy, which is perhaps shared with Chloranthaceae but is not found in Illiciaceae (Endress and Igersheim, 1997). This could be interpreted as primitive within the angiosperms (Endress and Igersheim, 1997), but there is no way to determine whether filling an open cavity with mucilage was inherited from a common ancestor or was an innovation, given that all other clades of angiosperms have eliminated the cavity by postgenital fusion. Mapped onto the 18S rDNA (Soltis et al., 1997a, 1997b, 1998,1999) and our atpB trees, this character would be viewed as plesiomorphic, but on the rbcL and atpB/rbcL trees it would be an apomorphy. Many families of magnoliid II are problematic, and more data are required to resolve the rooting of the angiosperms. Not only are more gene sequence data needed, but particularly critical would be characters that can be polarized by reference to outgroups. Unfortunately, many traits such as the presence of mucilage in an unfused carpel, microsporogenesis, and chemistry are unlikely to be available from the fossil record. Most recently, Qiu et al. (1999) identified Amborella at the root of the angiosperms based on a combined analysis of five genes from the mitochondrial, plastid and nuclear genomes.
Nonmolecular Characters and Relationships in the Eudicots
The larger clades found in our analysis do not correspond to the distribution of many of the morphological characters used in several previous taxonomic schemes (e.g., centrifugal stamen initiation, parietal placentation). In contrast, the two major
categories of angiosperms revealed in the combined atpB/rbcL analysis—noneudicots and eudicots (with their respective sets of familial and ordinal relationships)—have never been recognized previously. The sole character that delimits these groups is the nature of pollen development, which in the former results in uniaperturate (mostly monosulcate) pollen and in the latter triaperturate pollen.
The eudicots, in addition to triaperturate pollen, have a secretory anther tapetum, simultaneous microsporogenesis, filaments frequently much longer than anthers (an especially pronounced feature of the higher eudicots), and two leaf traces (one in many Ericales and Myrtales). Leaf venation in which there is a single primary vein with the lateral veins terminating at the margin (often in a tooth; craspedodromous) is also typical of the lower eudicots plus Dilleniaceae, Saxifragales, and Vitaceae, thus leaving this condition as a synapomorphy that is further modified in Caryophyllales, Santalales, asterids, and rosids (not in Rosales). The unanticipated Nelumbo/Platanus/ Proteaceae clade is difficult to characterize, given the diverse habits of its member taxa, but these plants are marked by epicuticular waxes that are rodor tube-shaped, large seeds with scanty or no endosperm (the latter condition found only in one genus of Proteaceae), and alternate vessel pitting.
The higher or core eudicots (here including Gunnera/Myrothamnus) exhibit calyx and corolla differentiation (although this is not well developed in some Saxifragales, Rosales, and members of Malpighiales such as Flacourtiaceae), calyx and corolla organs in fives (but not in Gunnera/Myrothamnus), a floral disk (but not in Caryophyllales, many Ericales, and Geraniales), nondecurrent stigmas, and antesepalous/antepetalous carpels that are partially to wholly fused (but not in some Saxifragales such as Paeoniaceae and some Crassulaceae). The general arrangement of floral organs in nearly all higher eudicots is thus quite stereotyped, but deviation (apparent reversals) from this syndrome marks subclades within several orders.
The lower eudicots (Buxaceae, Didymelaceae, Proteales, Ranunculales, and Trochodendraceae) deviate substantially from these characteristics, and in many respects

 342 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 49
have features otherwise typical of the noneudicots (e.g., see Nandi et al., 1998). Sabiaceae are an exception to this syndrome: They are like other lower eudicots in their craspedodromous venation and lack of ellagic acid, but their floral characters are much like those of the higher eudicots, from which, on the basis of the atpB/rbcL trees, they are excluded.
Caryophyllales as defined here are a remarkably well-supported group that no previous classification had identified. Their characters include the presence of pinitol and ancistrocladine, a spinulose sexine, nuclear endosperm development (also typical of the rosids), lack of hypostase, starchy endosperm (although not in core Caryophyllales), alternate vessel pitting, and simple perforations of vessel end-walls.
Although Caryophyllales form a welldefined clade, their relationships to asterids, rosids, and Saxifragales are not clear. Caryophyllales represent highly divergent members of the higher eudicots and lack several of the synapomorphies that otherwise characterize the asterids and rosids. Like most of the large and reasonably diverse clades identified here, members of Caryophyllales are highly specialized and have converged on floral and vegetative traits that are typical of other lineages; they lack, however, mucilage cavities/cells typical of the rosid/asterid clade, a hypostase in their seeds, and tricolporate pollen, features found in nearly all of the other more advanced groups. The distribution of anomalous secondary growth in Caryophyllales (e.g., Aizoaceae, Cactaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Didiereaceae, Dioncophyllaceae, Droseraceae, Nepenthaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phytolaccaceae, Plumbaginaceae, Polygonaceae, Portulacaceae, Rhabdodendraceae, and Simmondsiaceae) indicates that this condition is ancestral within the order. Likewise, anomalous floral development has been reported in several families (e.g., Aizoaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Phytolaccacaeae, and Portulacaceae [Ronse Decraene et al., 1998]) such that the apparently well-organized flowers of these plants, which are diplostemonous like the rosids, have arisen from a polymerous developmental pattern and should perhaps be best described as "pseudodiplostemo-
nous." Although Caryophyllales appear in many respects to be typical advanced eudicots in terms of habit and floral structure, they clearly have independently developed these traits, which is consistent with their isolation from the asterid/rosid clade in the atpB/rbcL trees.
Groups of Uncertain Position
For several groups the affinities are still not clear. The position of Zygophyllaceae is not yet well supported, but the occurrence of anthroquinones (also found in Gentianales, Myrtales, and Lamiales) indicates that their position in the combined atpB/ rbcL tree as sister to the nitrogen-fixing clade of eurosid I may be reasonable. The sister group relationship of Zygophyllaceae with Krameriaceae is well supported, although these two families are extremely divergent morphologically (Sheahan and Chase, 1996). A reticulate sexine might indicate a closer relationship with other eurosid I or II families in which this feature predominates. However, because the trait is presumably plesiomorphic, the psilate/ granulate sexine found in the nitrogenfixing clade does not exclude a sister group relationship for Zygophyllaceae/Krameriaceae.
Vitaceae likewise fit the rosid pattern; they have the nuclear endosperm development typical of eurosid I and II and a hypostase, which is present in all rosid/asterid families except those of Ericales. Dilleniaceae share nuclear endosperm development and a reticulate sexine with the eurosids, but a hypostase is absent, as in Santalales and Caryophyllales. Aextoxicaceae, Berberidopsidaceae, and Picramniaceae are poorly studied, which precludes any hypothesis about their relationships, although the last are clearly rosids. Berberidopsidaceae (two genera: Berberidopsis from temperate South America and Streptothamnus from eastern Australia), tentatively placed near the caryophyllids, are interesting because of their primitive wood and flowers, lacking clear differentiation of calyx and corolla (Miller, 1975). That all of these represent higher eudicots is clear on the basis of general floral organization (Berberidopsidaceae being the obvious ex-

 2000 SA VOLAINEN ET AL.—PHYLOGENETICS OF FLOWERING PLANTS 343
ception). However, characters exhibited by these taxa are mixtures of the traits otherwise characterizing the four major clades: asterids, Caryophyllales, rosids, and Saxifragales. As mentioned above, the lack of isomery in many of these enigmatic taxa places them outside the rosids and asterids. Santalales are isomerous, but they vary from one to more than five whorls, perhaps indicating that they too are outside the core lineages. Vitaceae are obhaplostemonous, which clearly distinguishes them from both rosids and asterids, although this was the character emphasized by some (e.g., Cronquist, 1981) to link them to Rhamnaceae, which is a member of Rosales (eurosid I). Before an overall synthesis of floral evolution in eudicots can be developed, these problematic groups must be accurately placed into the general phylogenetic scheme for angiosperms.
Overall, the types of characters that mark clades at the interordinal levels (sensu APG, 1998) within the angiosperms are not those of gross morphology that have been the mainstay of nearly all previous classifications; stipules and stamen organization are obvious exceptions. The results of DNA sequence analyses provide evidence that many underused characters are of great systematic importance: phytochemistry, development, and anatomy. Seed anatomy (presence of hypostase) in particular appears to be a rich source of phylogenetically important information and should be more extensively studied. Considerably more chemotaxonomic work using the DNA phylogenies to focus attention on particular taxa and compounds may also prove useful.
There is little doubt that the intuitive classifications of the past with their emphasis on weighting of selected characters are not useful in either a phylogenetic or predictive context. As compendia of characters, treatments such as those of Cronquist (1981) and Takhtajan (1997) are useful (particularly if they also contain extensive literature citations, as in Takhtajan, 1997). Fortunately, the incorporation of large numbers of DNA sequences with the extensive literature from chemotaxonomic, developmental, and anatomical studies into a phylogenetic framework offers for the first
time a robust alternative to evolutionary classifications.
Comparison with
the Large 18S rDNA Phylogeny
Chase et al. (1993) stated that no specific sampling plan guided their study. These authors tried to compile all available rbcL sequences for this first broad-scale phylogenetic analysis of angiosperms. Consequently, some plant groups were oversampled, whereas others were poorly or not represented at all. Since then, many additional sequences have been collected (especially for some rare and geographically restricted taxa), and a huge literature has been produced, which guided the sampling for this analysis. Hence, we chose 357 taxa to represent all major lineages, but this presented us with the limitations inherent in
analysis of such large matrices. There are 863 861
~7.5 X 10 possible rooted trees and 10 unrooted trees. Obviously, therefore, we cannot guarantee that we have found the shortest trees.
When we started to analyze the atpB sequences, we were amazed at how the new results matched the rbcL phylogeny. Because two plastid genes provide evidence for the same groups of families, despite the computational problems related to the sizes of the matrices, this may be taken as evidence that a clear historical pattern is being detected. Such consistency is unlikely to be due to chance alone. Conversely, the 18S rDNA trees (Soltis et al., 1997b) at least present only a degree of "soft" incongruence (Seelanan et al., 1997) with the two plastid trees. Application of the random partition test (Farris et al., 1995) indicated that incongruence between 18S rDNA and either atpB or rbcL is actually lower than between the two plastid genes (Soltis et al., 1997a,1998).
The placement of Ceratophyllum remains problematic. That Ceratophyllum should be either a monocot or sister to the monocots (with Acorus), as in the atpB tree, seems less plausible than its position as sister to the rest of angiosperms, as in the rbcL and the combined atpB/rbcL trees. Ceratophyllaceae are a cosmopolitan family (comprising a single genus and -2-30 species) of highly

specialized a n d reduced aquatics, lacking roots, cuticle, stomata, perianth, and woody tissues. Their affinities have been uncertain, but a placement near the base of the angiosperms compares favorably with their inaperturate pollen as well as with their floral features (Endress, 1994) and fossil record (Les, 1988).
Using 18S rDNA sequences, Soltis et al. (1997b) also presented as problematic the placement of the paleoherbs, Chloranthaceae, Aristolochiaceae, and Lactoridaceae, plus Winteraceae. We also found some discrepancies between the atpB and rbcL trees for these same groupings. Based on atpB, Winteraceae are not close to Magnoliales but instead go within the paleoherb group mentioned above. Based on rbcL or atpB/ rbcL, Winteraceae are placed as sister to Magnoliales, and Chloranthaceae form an isolated lineage at the base of the remaining magnoliids. However, there is no bootstrap support >50% for any of these relationships in our trees.
General patterns among eudicots are highly congruent among all molecular studies published so far. Based either on the nuclear 18S rDNA or the plastid genes, Ranunculales, Saxifragales, and Caryophyllales are well defined (corresponding, respectively, to the ranunculids, saxifragoids, and Caryophyllidae s.l. of Soltis et al., 1997b) as are the two largest clades, the rosids and asterids. Hamamelidae and Dilleniidae sensu Cronquist (1981) or Takhtajan (1997) are highly polyphyletic in the 18S rDNA trees and in the trees presented here, and these concepts should no longer be maintained (we subsume Hamamelidaceae in Saxifragales, and Dilleniaceae are still unplaced as to order). All trees contain the glucosinolate clade (Brassicales), the nitrogen-fixing clade (Cucurbitales, Fabales, Fagales, and Rosales), and the subclades of euasterids, for which the "early" versus "late sympetaly" of Erbar and Leins (1996) fits well.
Soltis et al. (1997b) stated that "perhaps the most unusual consistent feature of the 18S rDNA trees involved the placement of Caryophyllidae s. 1. within Asteridae s. 1." Because the spines of all these separate trees, rbcL, atpB, and 18S, are without clear patterns, mostly because of their very short branches, accurate placement of Caryoph-
yllales, Saxifragales, asterids, and rosids is not yet possible. In all the analyses here, Caryophyllales appear at the base of asterids plus rosids, but with simple branch removal and replacement experiments in MacClade (Maddison and Maddison, 1992), only a few additional steps (~l-5) are required to put Caryophyllales within any clade of asterids.
The basic problem of the 18S rDNA result is that by itself it provides little clear pattern. The 18S rDNA trees are highly unstable and have relatively low numbers of supported groups compared with those based on rbcL and atpB (Soltis et al., 1998; Chase and Cox, 1998; Hoot et al., 1995, 1999); the trees deviate largely because 18S rDNA has fewer variable positions experiencing most of the change (Chase and Cox, 1998). Nevertheless, 18S rDNA data make a valuable contribution to angiosperm phylogenetics. The sequences represent another genome, and in studies combining 18S rDNA, atpB, and rbcL, the three genes produce substantially stronger evidence of relationships than any of the separate analyses (Hoot et al., 1995, 1999; Soltis et al., 1997a, 1998; Chase and Cox, 1998). In spite of the differences in topology, the patterns of variation in 18S rDNA appear to be the same as those in rbcL and atpB.
Conflict with Evolutionary Classifications
In a recently proposed system of angiosperm classification, Takhtajan (1997:3) entirely dismissed DNA studies, stating that "these [DNA studies] often point to relationships that are clearly not compatible with other data and sometimes even quite outside the realm of possibility.... Besides the random noise in DNA sequences, molecular characters are subject to evolutionary convergence, parallelism, a n d reversal; therefore molecular methods are not a panacea. Molecular evidence should be used with, not in place of, morphological evidence". The published molecular results are n o t incompatible with morphological evidence itself but rather are incongruent with some interpretations of morphology. When analyzed phylogenetically (Nandi et al., 1998), non-DNA data produced patterns similar to those found with DNA sequences. When Takhtajan (1997:3) stated that DNA

 2000 SAVOLAINEN ET AL.—PHYLOGENETICS OF FLOWERING PLANTS 345
studies produced results that were "sometimes even quite outside the realm of possibility", he clearly implied that these DNAbased patterns were erroneous simply because they were in conflict with other data that he felt were more accurate. However, several morphological studies have been published that support DNA trees (e.g., see Patterson, 1988; Atcheley and Fitch, 1991; Novacek, 1992; Patterson et al., 1993; Hoot et al., 1995, 1997; Erbar and Leins, 1996; Spichiger and Savolainen, 1997; Hoot and Douglas, 1998; Rudall et al., 1998).
We can imagine that certain DNA results upset those who hold traditional perspectives. For example, it is easy to see that Nelumbo is not morphologically similar to Platanus and Proteaceae, although molecular data indicate they form a clade; but then, what alternative is more robust? Takhtajan classified Nelumbo in a subclass of its own, Nelumbonideae; this is not a refutation of the DNA trees but rather an admission that he has no evidence of what its affinities might be. A high frequency of small suprafamilial taxa is an admission of a lack of alternative hypotheses. Takhtajan's new system (1997) recognized two monofamilial and one bifamilial subclasses, 18 monofamilial and 11 bifamilial superorders, and 135 monofamilial and 26 bifamilial orders. The number of monogeneric families among the 591 he recognized is the highest of any published system. Such high numbers of small taxa reduce the information content of his classification and leave the impression that little is known about their higher-level relationships.
Gene sequences can create strongly supported patterns without being influenced by the multiple morphological convergences, reversals, and extreme morphological specializations that have occurred during plant evolution. For example, Aextoxicon was found with molecular data to be strongly supported in all three analyses as sister to Berberidopsis (Figs. 5g,n, 6d), but no obvious morphological features link these two genera. They probably represent specialized relics from ancient floras for which the intermediate linking taxa have simply disappeared. Nelumbo and its relationships to Platanus and Proteaceae are another example of how molecular information pro-
vides new and radically different hypotheses that might resolve long-standing impasses.
In the trees presented here, the results are basically of two types, which set the stage for future research: (1) groups that are well supported and sometimes drastically different from classical views, which merit further study because some evidence of this pattern is likely to have been retained during evolution (e.g., micromorphology, biochemistry, or palynology); and (2) groups that are weakly supported for which additional data are required to define their position accurately.
An example of the first category is the clade of families here named Malpighiales; no one had previously suggested a group composed of these families, and there is no obvious suite of characters that unites all these families. Similarly, Saxifragales appear as a strongly supported clade, but their circumscription based on DNA analysis differs from that suggested by any previous author. A parallel example can be seen with the families of Brassicales: No previous taxonomist ever included all these families in the same group except Dahlgren (1975). The single clue to the common ancestry of Brassicales is mustard oils.
Groups that fall into the second category noted above include Zygophyllaceae/Krameriaceae (Sheahan and Chase, 1996), which appear in different places in every analysis conducted, including those presented here, but never with high bootstrap support. They most often appear as the sister of the nitrogen-fixing families, as in the combined analysis (Fig. 6e). The combination of being fairly sequence-divergent (37 hypothesized substitutions) and low divergence near the rosid I and rosid II split (3,4, or 7 hypothesized substitutions; Fig. 6e) makes a robust placement unlikely until more sequence data are available. Dilleniaceae, Vitaceae, Picramniaceae, and Santalales also fall into this category.
Prospectsfor Finding
an Accurate Angiosperm Tree
The flowering plants represent one of the largest groups of organisms, comprising >250,000 species in -13,000 genera and 500 families. The analysis of large data sets containing hundreds of taxa is the only way to

address the phylogeny of such a large diverse group. If obtaining only a reasonably optimal tree is unsatisfactory, then we are at an impasse. Further progress is precluded until new methods of analysis are developed or substantially greater amounts of data are available. However, an inability to recover the shortest tree is definitely less of a problem than has previously been maintained.
extensive computing time in the attempt to find shorter trees based on any of the single genes (contrary to the admonitions of Rice et al., 1998). Rather, this analysis of a combined atpB/rbcL data set, as well as other recent analyses of atpB /rbcL /18S rDNA (Chase and Cox, 1998; Soltis et al., 1998) indicate clearly that our efforts are better placed in sequencing more taxa and genes. Finding yet shorter trees for individual genes will never recover new groups with high levels of internal support; all such well-supported groups are present in the

we map the rbcL characters onto the com-
bined topology (Fig. 7), 75 extra steps are
found compared with the rbcL-alone analy-

are there important differences in CI and
RI. Although this may not seem like a sub-
stantial underestimate, it is in the range re-
quired to move Ceratophyllum from sister to underestimate. We know that homoplasy Acorus to sister to the rest of the angiohas been underestimated, but we cannot

percentage longer than thelength of the
most-parsimonious tree. In addition, we
have indicated how much longer are the
trees depicted from each individual gene undoubtedly thousands of trees at this
when optimized onto the combined topology. These percentages represent the lower limits of the starting trees obtained for atpB or rbcL trees without swapping: Beyond these limits, further swapping leads to trees that are too short, and a more accurate topology (as found with the combined matrix) can never be recovered by continued search for yet shorter trees (see Fig. 7).
Given that our goal is to find the true tree for angiosperms, there is no point spending
length. Without evidence, either from internal support or congruence (these are highly correlated, e.g., in Soltis et al., 1998), we are in a quagmire from which a rigorous analysis cannot extricate us.
If we had spent another year of computing time on analyses of each of the two individual genes, we almost certainly would have found shorter trees, but these would have added nothing to our knowledge of angiosperm relationships. Patterns for which
be found have a high probability of being spurious because single-gene trees inevitably are underestimates. The only relationships that we can be confident about are those that have high internal support, and
first require swapping to find the shortest tree.
Because we can demonstrate that a data set with weak phylogenetic patterns leads
we are also suspicious that all optimality criteria are unreliable if the patterns in the data are weak because they will also inevitably underestimate tree length (no matter which algorithm is used). A distance-based algorithm can correct the distances, but it cannot correct the relationships any better than we can when we know that the atpB tree produced by parsimony analysis is an

there is bootstrap support <50% (or congruence with other analyses) are unreliable even if the shortest tree(s) can be found. This is not an argument against the application of parsimony or other optimality criteria, but rather an acknowledgment of the limitations of data sets that lack clear patterns (i.e., those with too few or conflicting characters).
CONCLUSION
Our purpose in this paper was not only to produce a plastid tree for the angiosperms but also to bring into focus a series of issues pertaining to the phylogeny of flowering plants and the analysis of large data sets. Here, by adding another plastid gene (atpB) for an extended sampling of flowering plants, we performed phylogenetic analyses in which numerous clades are (1) highly supported (>80% bootstrap) on the combined analysis of two plastid genes, (2) identified in the most-parsimonious trees recovered when analyzing each matrix independently, and (3) congruent with many of the clades identified by 18S rDNA. This provides convincing evidence that such analyses can provide the framework for a new classification of flowering plants that is based largely on the DNA patterns but has a great deal of corroboration from other lines of evidence (APG, 1998). These DNA-based trees are in close agreement with many morphological, anatomical, and chemical characters that were underused in earlier classifications (e.g., Cronquist, Takhtajan, etc.).
Furthermore, we fully agree that large data sets are not as tractable as we would wish, but the increasing availability of computer power will certainly permit further analytical improvements; further, however, we have demonstrated that not obtaining the shortest possible trees is also less important than previously recognized. In spite of limitations, the large analyses thus far published demonstrate a level of congruence that is inconsistent with the notion that simply because they are large they must be highly flawed. We expect the next 5 years of molecular systematics to usher in even faster and more drastic change. As a result of this exciting period of change, evolutionary and ecological processes will be ad-
dressed in ways previously considered speculative (e.g., see Sanderson and Donoghue, 1996; Savolainen and Goudet, 1998). In short, analyses of large data sets are not only feasible but have proven to be robust. Combining both atpB and rbcL, which together represent only —3,000 bp (with about half of these variable in two or more taxa, i.e., 1,521 sites), was useful because a clearer phylogenetic signal was detected. Yet, more characters are needed to infer robustly the branching pattern of ancient lineages such as Ceratophyllaceae and the magnoliids. Some of what might be phyletic radiations (for example, the polytomies composed of asterids, Berberidopsidaceae / Aextoxicaceae, CaryophyHales, Dilleniaceae, Santalales, Saxifragales, and Vitaceae) also require more data to be adequately estimated. The addition of 18S rDNA sequences undoubtedly greatly improved the results (e.g., Soltis et a l , 1998; Hoot et al., 1999; also see Soltis et al. [1999] for a recent phylogenetic analysis of the angiosperms based on rbcL, atpB and 18S rDNA combined), but other molecular information can be useful, for example, patterns of genome organization (Qiu et al., 1998).
Now that we can see that the future holds the possibility for producing a robust phylogeny by the direct combination of several genes, we can also expect to improve the models of molecular evolution by optimizing various features on these well-supported phylogenetic relationships; however, the use of models to develop accurate phylogenetic estimates is itself circular and can prevent the recognition of patterns that contradict models. If individual matrices are inadequate to produce robust estimates of relationships, then estimating probabilities from the data themselves can mislead. If clear patterns of relationships can be estimated without resorting to lengthy or assumption-laden methods of analysis, particularly for large matrices such as these, why then would anyone favor particular results or have greater confidence in them just because they are based on application of a specific optimality criterion? We prefer robustness and congruence as the best measures of accuracy, and simple tree-building algorithms are more than adequate for these purposes. We need to know in more
