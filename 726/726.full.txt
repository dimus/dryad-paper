Abstract
Characterization of the fine-scale population dynamics of the mosquito Aedes taeniorhynchus is needed to improve our understanding of its role as a disease vector in the Galapagos Islands. We used microsatellite data to assess the genetic structure of coastal and highland mosquito populations and patterns of gene flow between the two habitats through time on Santa Cruz Island. In addition, we assessed possible associations of mosquito abundance and genetic diversity with environmental variables. The coastal and highland mosquito populations were highly differentiated from each other all year round, with some gene flow detected only during periods of increased precipitation. The results support the hypothesis that selection arising from ecological differences between habitats is driving adaptation and divergence in A. taeniorhynchus, and maintaining long-term genetic differentiation of the populations against gene flow. The highland and lowland populations may constitute an example of incipient speciation in progress. Highland populations were characterized by lower observed heterozygosity and allelic richness, suggesting a founder effect and⁄or lower breeding site availability in the highlands. A lack of reduction in genetic diversity over time in highland populations suggests that they survive dry periods as dormant eggs. Association between mosquito abundance and precipitation was strong in the highlands, whereas tide height was the main factor affecting mosquito abundance on the coast. Our findings suggests differences in the infection dynamics of mosquito-borne parasites in the highlands compared to the coast, and a higher risk of mosquito-driven disease spread across these habitats during periods of increased precipitation.

Introduction
The black salt-marsh mosquito (Aedes taeniorhynchus Wiedemann) is the only native mosquito in the Galapagos Islands, where it is distributed widely. It feeds on a wide range of endemic taxa and is likely to play

a major role in the transmission and spread of extant and introduced vector-borne pathogens in the archipelago (Bataille et al. 2009a). Bataille et al. (2009a) showed that this mosquito colonized the archipelago around 200 000 years ago and now breeds in highland habitats in the Galapagos Islands, in addition to coastal habitat, as is typical on the mainland. In Galapagos, coastal habitats are typically rocky coasts with mangroves, with an arid native vegetation zone inland. The highland has higher precipitation with lush vegetation, some areas of which have been converted for subsistence agriculture. The initial study found gene flow between populations in different habitats to be low, possibly indicating a process of on-going adaptive divergence of highlandbreeding mosquitoes from those on the coast, and that A. taeniorhynchus in Galapagos could represent a new example of on-going incipient speciation in mosquitoes, such as observed in the Anopheles gambiae species complex (Besansky et al. 2003; Stump et al. 2005).
The breeding biology of A. taeniorhynchus is linked to temporary water habitats characterized by a wide range of salinity such as mangrove and salt marshes (Nielsen & Nielsen 1953). They lay eggs in moist soil, and these hatch when the area is flooded by rain or tide, resulting in the synchronous emergence of huge broods that can be a nuisance for both human and animals (Anderson & Fortner 1988). Aedes taeniorhynchus eggs are resistant to desiccation and cold temperature and can remain viable in a dormant state for years (O’Meara & Edman 1975). Aedes taeniorhynchus populations could, therefore, survive in sites subjected to periods of unfavourable weather conditions without a need for replenishment from immigration.
Some studies have assessed the effect of environmental factors on A. taeniorhynchus abundance in North American coasts, and the importance of each factor varied across study sites. The main factors affecting immature A. taeniorhynchus abundance were the tide height and the amount of rainfall in Southern Florida (Ritchie & Montague 1995), tide height at a site in California (Lang 2003), and seasonal rainfall and temperature at a site in Virginia (Ailes 1998). Rainfall and high tide are necessary to flood the ground where eggs have been laid to allow them to hatch and for the larvae to survive, although heavy rainfall and high tide can also decrease mosquito abundance by washing eggs away and maintaining predatory fish populations (Ritchie & Montague 1995). As for all mosquito species, high temperature increases the growth rate of A. taeniorhynchus, but it also represents a risk because of the evaporation of temporary pools (Lang 2003). Many other abiotic and biotic factors may affect larval abundance, such as levels of dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, the level of plant cover or the larval diet
(Tun-Lin et al. 2000; Muturi et al. 2009), but the effect of these factors on A. taeniorhynchus abundance has not been studied.
If A. taeniorhynchus has adapted to breed in the Galapagos highlands, its ecology might be different from coastal populations, as highland populations would depend exclusively on rainfall for breeding sites. If mosquito migration between habitats is limited, the abundance of mosquitoes in the highlands should have a greater dependence on precipitation than in coastal populations, which can rely on high tides to provide breeding pools during dry periods. Highland populations of A. taeniorhynchus could deposit their eggs in damp soil, natural cavities such as tree holes or bromeliads (Belkin et al. 1970), or artificial cavities that are filled with rain water. Therefore, availability of breeding sites would be predicted to be more limited in the highlands than along the coast, resulting in lower mosquito abundance and genetic diversity in the highlands, as observed for Culex quinquefasciatus between low and middle elevation in Hawaii (Keyghobadi et al. 2006) and for Anophles nili between the evergreen forest block and the savanna ⁄ forest ecotone in West and Central Africa (Ndo et al. 2010).
The characterization of the fine-scale population dynamics of A. taeniorhynchus and its link to environmental conditions could substantially improve our understanding of the likely role of this species as a disease vector in the Galapagos Islands. Also, such knowledge will help the implementation of efficient and effective mosquito surveillance and control programmes to protect Galapagos unique biodiversity from novel invasive mosquito-borne pathogens. In this study, we use microsatellite data to determine the genetic structure of coastal and highland mosquito populations and to assess patterns of gene flow between the two habitats over time. In addition, we test possible associations of genetic diversity in mosquito populations with habitat type and other environmental variables. Finally, we discuss the implications of the results obtained in terms of adaptive divergence of A. taeniorhynchus in different habitats, mosquito population dynamics, and of disease epidemiology and control in the Galapagos Islands.
Materials and methods
Temporal and spatial mosquito sampling and environmental data collection
For this study, we focused on the island of Santa Cruz in the Galapagos archipelago. This island presents several advantages for the implementation of the long-term sampling necessary to answer the questions posed in this study. First, the Galapagos Genetics, Epidemiology
Ó 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

and Pathology Laboratory (GGEPL) and the National Park Headquarters are based in Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz Island, providing the logistics required for periodical mosquito sampling. Second, a major road crosses the island from North (Itabaca Channel, link with Baltra Island) to South (Puerto Ayora), passing through many of the ecological zones found in the archipelago, thus facilitating mosquito collection in different habitats and at different elevations (Fig. 1).
To estimate mosquito abundance, adult mosquitoes were collected using miniature incandescent light traps with photoswitch-controlled CO2 release system (John W. Hock Company, Gainesville, FL, USA). According to the manufacturer, four nights of sampling should provide a good index of mosquito activity in a radius of 20–100 m, depending on the environmental conditions. Aedes taeniorhynchus is a strong flyer with a large activity span (Nielsen & Nielsen 1953). Therefore, to study mosquito dispersal activity, traps were set for 4–5 consecutive nights twice per month in March, June, September, October and November 2006 and in March, May, June, July and August 2007 at a coastal site (Puerto Ayora) and three highland sites on Santa Cruz Island (Bellavista, Chato, Gemelos; Fig. 1), with 10– 15 days separating each sampling session. Additionally, mosquitoes were collected over four consecutive nights at a fourth highland site (Santa Rosa) in March 2006 and October 2006, and in another coastal site (Itabaca channel) over three consecutive nights in March 2006. Mosquitoes were separated from other insects collected in the traps, identified to species using morphological features and stored at )20 °C.
Monthly precipitation data were gathered from climate stations run by the Charles Darwin Research Station, Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz Island. Precipitation data from Santa Rosa climate station were used for investigating possible correlations with mosquito abundance in the ‘Gemelos’ and ‘Santa Rosa’ highland sites, data from the Bellavista climate station was used for ‘Bellavista’ and ‘Chato’ sites, and data from the Puerto Ayora climate station was used for the ‘Puerto Ayora’ coastal site. Monthly minimum and maximum tempera-
tures were recorded in the same way, although temperature data were available only from the Puerto Ayora and Bellavista climate stations, so data from Bellavista were used for all highland sites. Tide height data were obtained from http://www.mobilegeographics.com for Baltra Island, which we used as a proxy for the height of tide in Santa Cruz Island.
To study temporal changes in genetic variation in the Santa Cruz mosquito populations, mosquito samples from six different time points for one highland site (‘Gemelos’) and for the coastal Puerto Ayora site were used (Table 1). Mosquitoes sampled in Puerto Ayora in May 2007 were also used in this study, as this was an interesting time when mosquitoes could only be caught on the coast and not in the highland sites. In addition, mosquitoes sampled at the Itabaca Channel (Fig. 1) were included in the study to look for genetic differentiation between two well-separated coastal sites.
Mosquito abundance and association with environmental variables
Monthly mosquito abundance was measured in terms of number of mosquitoes caught per day for each month. Mosquito abundance can be associated with various environmental factors, such as precipitation and temperature, which often are inter-dependent and will vary over time, so simple tests of correlation between mosquito abundance and isolated environmental variables might not correctly represent the complexity of the interactions. Therefore, mosquito abundance was analysed by fitting a linear model with various environmental data as independent variables using the statistical platform R v2.7.0. A Shapiro–Wilk test (Shapiro & Wilk 1965) was used to determine if the mosquito abundance data followed a normal distribution. As it was not the case (see Results), we used a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution of errors, which is considered more appropriate for highly aggregated count data than straightforward linear models that assume a normal distribution of errors (Crawley 2007).

Minimum temperature, maximum temperature, tide height and precipitation were tested as covariates in the analysis. Year and month of sampling, habitat type, the interaction between precipitation and habitat, between precipitation and month, and the interaction of maximum ⁄ minimum temperatures with either habitat type or month were also tested as factors in the model. Month and year were included as variables to take into account possible unknown factors that might vary with time and have an effect on mosquito abundance.
We used likelihood ratio tests to calculate the predictive power of each independent variable in the model. Independent variables that did not show a significant association with mosquito abundance were excluded from the model. The difference in mosquito abundance between year and between habitat types was further analysed using a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (Wilcoxon 1945). In addition, the difference in precipitation levels between habitats was also calculated using a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (Wilcoxon 1945).
DNA extraction and microsatellite genotyping
The abdomen was removed from female mosquito specimens before extraction to avoid female DNA contamination from male sperm or eggs, and the whole body was used with male specimens. DNA was extracted using a salting-out extraction method with ammonium acetate (Nichols et al. 2000). Each mosquito was individually genotyped using 11 microsatellite loci developed by Bataille et al. (2009b), organized in two multiplexes as described by these authors. Multiplex PCRs were performed in a 2-lL volume, containing approximately 10 ng of dried down DNA, 0.2–0.3 lM of each primer and 1 lL of QIAGEN four-dye system Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Kenta et al. 2008). The PCR programme used was 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature (55 °C or 60 °C, see Bataille et al. 2009b) for 90 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and finally 60 °C for 30 min. Allele sizes were assigned using an ABI3730 DNA Analyzer and GENEMAPPER v2.0 software (Applied Biosystems).
Microsatellite data analysis
The frequency of null alleles was estimated using the program CERVUS v3.0 (Kalinowski et al. 2007). Conformity to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and to linkage disequilibrium was tested with GENEPOP 4.0 (Raymond & Rousset 1995). For both the tests, a Markov Chain method, run for 100 000 iterations, was used to estimate the significance of the deviations observed, and the P-value was adjusted using a sequential Bonferroni
correction (Rice 1989). Allelic richness, observed heterozygosity (Ho) and inbreeding coefficient (FIS) were calculated in FSTAT v.2.9.3 (Goudet 1995) for each population at each sampling date.
Population structure. Genetic differentiation between populations was quantified by calculating pairwise FST (Weir & Cockerham 1984) in FSTAT v.2.9.3 (Goudet 1995). Permutation tests with 10 000 randomizations were used to determine if the observed values were significantly different from zero, and the P-value was adjusted using a sequential Bonferroni correction (Rice 1989). We also examined the population structure with the Bayesian individual clustering method implemented in the program STRUCTURE v.2.2 (Pritchard et al. 2000). We used the admixture model and tested for K potential genetic clusters contributing to the sample, with values of K ranging from 1 to 16. For each value of K, the programme was run five times with 300 000 iterations of the MCMC. The first 100 000 iterations were discarded as burn-in steps, and convergence of parameters was assessed with the in programme diagnostic tools. The optimal K was identified by calculating the posterior probability for each mean value of K using the mean estimated log-likelihood across replicate runs, and by calculating the DK statistic, which is based on the second order rate of change in the mean posterior probability of the data for each successive value of K (Evanno et al. 2005).
In addition, we used a Bayesian individual clustering method implemented in the program NEWHYBRIDS (Anderson & Thompson 2002) to identify different categories of hybrid between coastal and highland populations. This method compute the posterior probability that each individual belongs to each of several hybrid categories: pure coastal breed, pure highland breed, F1 hybrid between coastal and highland populations, backcross F1-coast, backcross F1-highland and F2 hybrid. The programme was run with 300 000 iterations of the MCMC. The first 100 000 iterations were discarded as burn-in steps, and the convergence of parameters was assessed with the in programme diagnostic tools.
The correlations between genetic distance and log(geographical distance) matrices were assessed with a Mantel test as implemented in the web service Isolation by Distance (Jensen et al. 2005) using 10 000 matrix randomizations and Rousset’s M (calculated as FST ⁄ 1)FST) as measures of pairwise genetic distance in the matrix. Only distances between populations sampled at a same time period were included in the analysis. The effect of elevation on genetic distance was assessed in the same way using a matrix of elevation difference between populations. Partial Mantel tests were also executed with the same software to control

for the effect of geographical distances and elevation on each other and for the effect of habitat type (coast or highland) in these analyses.
Estimation of migration patterns. We used the program GENECLASS2 (Piry et al. 2004) to identify potential migrants in the populations following the method of Paetkau et al. (2004) with probability values calculated after a Monte-Carlo sampling of 10 000 simulations. The effective number of migrants between each population (4Nem, where Ne is the effective population size and m the migration rate) was calculated using a Bayesian approach (Beerli 2006) implemented in the program MIGRATE v3.0 (Beerli 2008). This program was also used to have an estimate of the effective population size of each population in terms of h = 4Nel, where l is the mutation rate per site per generation. The program was run initially with default setting for 10 000 000 generations with a 2 000 000 generation burn-in. The outputs from the initial run were then used to parameterize three further runs of the same length, and the congruence of the results was verified. Migration rate between populations was also estimated in terms of m (proportion of migrants in a population) with another Bayesian method using MCMC algorithm to estimate posterior probabilities, implemented in the program BAYESASS v1.3. (Wilson & Rannala 2003). The effective population size Ne was also estimated using a likelihood method in MLNE (Wang & Whitlock 2003). This method estimates Ne size from genotypic data of a population sampled at different time points, giving the Ne for a population for a time period and not at each sampling time. It can be used here to identify changes in population sizes between different time periods, notably before and after the drought period of April–May 2007 (Table 1). Enough sampling dates to allow such estimation were available only for Puerto Ayora and Los Gemelos.
Detection of population bottlenecks. We used the program BOTTLENECK (Cornuet & Luikart 1996) to compare, for each locus in each population, the Ho to the expected heterozygosity obtained from simulations of the population under mutation–drift equilibrium, and given the observed number of alleles and the sample size. Both the infinite allele model (IAM) and the two-phased model (TPM) of microsatellite mutations were used with default parameters in the simulations. A sign test or a Wilcoxon sign-rank test based on 10 000 iterations is used to test statistically if a bottleneck has occurred (Cornuet & Luikart 1996).
Association analysis between population genetics and environmental variables. We analysed the data to look for possible associations between different genetic char-
acteristics of each population (FIS, Ho and allelic richness) and environmental variables using the same method as for the analysis of mosquito abundance. A Shapiro–Wilk test (Shapiro & Wilk 1965) was used to determine if the distribution of the three genetic measures followed a normal distribution. As this was the case (see Results), they were analysed separately by fitting a linear model with a normal distribution of errors using the statistical platform R v2.7.0. F-tests were used to calculate the predictive power of each independent variable in the model, and those that did not show a significant association with mosquito abundance were excluded from the model.
Results
Mosquito abundance in Santa Cruz and association with environmental variables
Aedes taeniorhynchus mosquitoes were caught in Puerto Ayora (coastal site) during every collection period, whereas no mosquitoes were caught in May or June 2007 in the highland sites of Los Gemelos or Chato, or in May 2007 in Bellavista (Table 1). Among the months of sampling collection, mosquitoes were most abundant in March, October and November (Table 1). No precipitation was recorded in May 2007 in either the coastal or the highland weather stations on Santa Cruz. In June 2007, only 1.3 mm of rain was recorded on the coast, whereas rainfall of between 25 and 55mm was recorded in the highlands (Table 1). During the period of study, rainfall was significantly higher in the highland habitat than in the coastal habitat (Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 50, P < 0.001).
Patterns of mosquito abundance did not follow a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test, W = 0.65, P < 0.001) but were highly aggregated, so the association of mosquito abundance with environmental variables was analysed using a generalized linear model. In the model, mosquito abundance was significantly associated with the year of sampling (likelihood ratio test, LRT1 = 12.4, P = 0.002), mosquitoes being more abundant in 2006 than in 2007 (Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 283, P < 0.001). Mosquito abundance was also positively associated with the tide height (LRT1 = 4.6, P = 0.03). Overall mosquito abundance was higher in the coastal habitat than in the highlands (Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 192, P = 0.02). A significant interaction was observed between precipitation and habitat type (LRT1 = 16.4, P < 0.0001), and between precipitation and month (LRT7 = 17.9, P = 0.013).
We repeated all these analyses for each habitat separately to remove the interaction between precipitation and habitat. In the highlands, the difference of
Ó 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

mosquito abundance between sampling year remained significant (LRT1 = 5.3, P = 0.02), as did the interaction between precipitation and month (LRT6 = 14.7, P = 0.02), but tide height did no longer have a significant effect in this population (LRT1 = 0.5, P = 0.48). The variable ‘month’ can be removed as a variable in the model if we assume that there are no other environmental variables with monthly fluctuations affect mosquito abundance. With month removed from the model, mosquito abundance in the highlands increased significantly with precipitation (LRT1 = 17, P < 0.001). On the coast, there was no effect of precipitation on mosquito abundance (LRT1 = 0.26, P = 0.61), but the effect of tide height was highly significant (LRT1 = 10.2, P = 0.001) and the difference of mosquito abundance between sampling year remained significant (LRT1 = 5.8, P = 0.02). There was no significant effect of temperature on mosquito abundance in any of the analyses (LRT1 = 0.006–0.02, P = 0.88–0.96).
Temporal and geographical genetic structure in Santa Cruz Island
A total of 479 individuals were successfully genotyped with 11 microsatellite markers (Table 1 and Table S1, Supporting information). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 1 to 17 and the Ho ranged from 0 to 1.00. Tests for linkage disequilibrium between all pairs of loci across populations found no significant disequilibrium after Bonferroni correction. Exact tests showed that loci Atae01 and Atae02 deviated significantly from the Hardy– Weinberg expectations in most coastal populations analysed, often associated with high frequency of estimated null alleles (Table S1, Supporting information). Subsequent analyses were performed with the data from Atae01 and Atae02 excluded to avoid potential biases.
FST values for pairwise comparisons between coastal and highland populations were significantly different
from zero for every sampling date (range 0.092–0.217, P < 0.001; Table S2, Supporting information). The highest FST value for the genetic differentiation between coastal and highland populations was found between the population at Itabaca channel and the population at Los Gemelos in March 2006 (0.217), whereas the lowest FST value between coastal and highland populations was between Bellavista and Puerto Ayora in September 2006 (0.092). FST values between Gemelos and Puerto Ayora were also relatively low in November 2006 and August 2007 (0.097 and 0.094, respectively) in comparison with values obtained at other dates of sampling (range: 0.136–0.174, Table S2, Supporting information). Genetic differentiation between the coastal populations of Puerto Ayora and Itabaca Channel was significant (FST = 0.02, P < 0.05), but low in comparison with values obtained for comparisons between coastal and highland populations. Seven of 10 FST values for pairwise comparisons between highland locations were not significantly different from zero. The three significant FST values were relatively low, ranging from 0.014 to 0.055 (Table S2, Supporting information). All but one of the pairwise comparisons between populations sampled at the same site at different times gave FST values not significantly different from zero (Table S3, Supporting information). For the mosquito population of Puerto Ayora, significant genetic differentiation was obtained between March 2007 and May 2007 (FST = 0.026, P < 0.001, Table S3, Supporting information).
In the Bayesian clustering analysis performed with STRUCTURE v.2.2, the mean value of the log-likelihood function of K reached a maximum plateau for K = 4, with the mean value of the log-likelihood affected by wide variance for all K > 4 (Fig. S1, Supporting information). With the method of Evanno et al. (2005), the second order rate of change in the likelihood (DK) was by far the highest at K = 2, suggesting this was the most likely number of clusters (Fig. S1, Supporting informa-

tion). For K = 2, mosquito individuals from both coastal sites were predominantly assigned to one cluster at all sampling times, whereas individuals of all highland sites were assigned to the other cluster (Fig. 2). No further population structure changes were detected within coastal or highland populations with time, at K = 3 to K = 5 (Fig. S2, Supporting information).
The Bayesian individual clustering performed with NEWHYBRIDS gave very similar results to STRUCTURE (Fig. S3, Supporting information). Most individuals sampled in the highland habitat were assigned to a pure highland genotype, whereas individuals from the coast were mainly identified with relatively low resolution as either pure coastal genotype or a backcross between F1 hybrids and pure coastal genotype. No individual was identified as an F1 or F2 hybrid. A small number of migrant individuals were also identified in both habitats.
There was a significant correlation between the genetic distance and the log(geographical distance) between mosquito populations sampled (r = 0.61, Mantel test, Z1 = 42.2, P < 0.0001; Fig. 3a). There was a significant correlation between genetic distance and elevation difference (r = 0.56, Mantel test, Z1 = 265.9, P < 0.0001, Fig. 3b), although this effect of elevation lost its significance once the shared association with the (highland) habitat type was accounted for (r = 0.1064, Mantel test, Z1 = 11.5 P = 0.097). Analysis with BOTTLENECK showed that, regardless of the mutation model used, no population had a significant signature of a genetic bottleneck.
Temporal changes in migration rates between mosquito population
In the Bayesian clustering analysis performed with STRUCTURE v.2.2, two individuals from the coast were assigned to a highland cluster, and 13 individuals from the highlands were assigned to a coastal cluster (Fig. 2). Six out of these 10 individuals were mosquitoes sampled in September 2006 in Bellavista, which is the highland site closest to Puerto Ayora (coastal site, Fig. 1). The program NEWHYBRIDS identified the same individuals as potential migrants. The migrants from highland to coast were identified as pure highland lineage, whereas the migrants from coast to highland were identified as a backcross between F1 hybrids and pure coastal lineage (Fig. S3, Supporting information).
The program GENECLASS2 detected one individual caught in Puerto Ayora in March 2006 as a potential migrant from the highland site ‘Gemelos’ (P = 0.004). Significant migration rates (with confidence limit not overlapping zero) were detected with the program MIGRATE and BAYESASS among most highland sites in March 2006 (Fig. 4, Table S4, Supporting information). In September 2006, migration was also observed among some highland sites, and a small but significant level of migration was detected with both programs from the coast (Puerto Ayora) to the closest highland site (Bellavista; MIGRATE: 4Nem = 8.66, CI: 1.24–83; BAYESASS: m = 0.08, CI: 0.04–0.15; Fig. 4, Table S4, Supporting information). In October 2006, migration was observed only from Santa Rosa to Gemelos using MIGRATE and BAYESASS. No significant migration was observed in November 2006 or in March 2007. In August 2007, MIGRATE detected migration between highland sites, whereas BAYESASS detected migration from Puerto Ayora towards the highland sites of Bellavista (m = 0.25, CI: 0.15–0.32), Chato (m = 0.26, CI: 0.17–0.32), and Gemelos (m = 0.31, CI: 0.27–0.33). Some migration was also observed from Gemelos to Puerto Ayora with BAYESASS for the same date, but with wide confidence limits

(m = 0.24, CI: 0.001–0.33; Fig. 4, Table S4, Supporting information).
Estimations of effective population size h were affected by large confidence intervals sometimes overlapping zero. The estimation of h in the Chato population was significantly higher in March 2006 (h = 0.045, CI: 0.022–0.098), than in August 2007 (h = 0.005, CI: 0.002–0.038, Table S4, Supporting information). All other values of h had confidence intervals overlapping each other (Table S4, Supporting information). The program MLNE detected a significant change in the effective population size of Puerto Ayora from the period of September–November 2006 (Ne = 566.3, CI: 276.9– 3303.9) to the period of May 2007–August 2007 (Ne = 106.4, CI: 67–216). No change in Ne could be detected in the highland site Los Gemelos, where the estimation of the effective population size was associated with a large variance (Ne = 953.4, CI: 459.9–6032.3).
Association between genetic variability and environmental factors
The distribution of values of FIS, Ho and allelic richness did not significantly depart from normality (Shapiro–Wilk test, W = 0.95 ⁄ 0.99 ⁄ 0.94, P = 0.31 ⁄ 0.98 ⁄ 0.2, respectively), so a linear model with a normal distribution of errors was used for the analysis of their associ-
ation with environmental factors. Values of FIS were not significantly different in coastal populations than in highland populations (Table 1; F test, F1 = 0.66, P = 0.43), and no significant effect of precipitation or tide was observed (F1 = 0.03 ⁄ 2.7, P = 0.99 ⁄ 0.13, respectively).
Observed heterozygosity in mosquito populations was significantly higher in the coast than in the highlands (Table 1; F test, F1 = 6.1, P = 0.029). Relatively high levels of Ho (0.67, with nine loci; Table 1) were observed in May 2007 in Puerto Ayora, in a period of low precipitation when no mosquitoes were found in the highlands. Mosquito populations in the coast had significantly higher allelic richness than highland populations (Table 1; F1 = 33.4, P = 0.0001). There was no effect of precipitation or tide on allelic richness (F1 = 0.03 ⁄ 0.51, P = 0.99–0.25, respectively) and Ho (F1 = 0.01 ⁄ 2.9, P = 0.99–0.11, respectively).

Association between environmental factors and mosquito abundance
As expected for an insect with a flood-water larval stage, the results obtained in this study show that the abundance of A. taeniorhynchus in Santa Cruz Island is

associated with precipitation and tide height. However, separate analyses for coastal and highland mosquito populations showed that tide was the main factor affecting mosquito abundance on the coast, whereas abundance in the highlands was mainly dependent on precipitation. These results support the hypothesis that A. taeniorhynchus breeds in highland habitats, as suggested by Bataille et al. (2009a) and early field observations (Belkin et al. 1970). Importantly, it also suggests that mosquito populations in both habitat types are characterized by very different dynamics associated with their specific environments and that these should be considered separately in future ecological studies.
Despite the heavier precipitation recorded in highland habitats, mosquitoes were significantly more abundant on the coast. This result is not surprising as breeding pools (e.g. in mangroves, lava rocks) should be more numerous for coastal mosquitoes than for mosquitoes in the highlands, which are likely to depend on water-filled tree holes and bromeliads and other patchily distributed, transient breeding sites. Although temperature is recognized as an important factor influencing the development time of immature stages of A. taeniorhynchus and other mosquitoes (Lang 2003), we found no effect of temperature on mosquito abundance in Santa Cruz. This could be because of the availability of breeding pools for long enough periods of time to allow the completion of mosquito maturation even during cooler periods. Many other abiotic and biotic factors, such as levels of dissolved oxygen and nitrogen, larval diet or vegetation cover could also affect differently larval development and survival rate in the two habitats (Tun-Lin et al. 2000; Muturi et al. 2007). Further work is needed to examine the characteristics of coastal and highland breeding sites of A. taeniorhynchus in Galapagos to study these effects.
Mosquito trapping could not be performed all year round during this study because of logistical constraints, and a more-continuous sampling effort allied with more-detailed weather data might unravel additional associations of mosquito abundance with environmental factors. Also, year-round sampling should be conducted on islands other than Santa Cruz to compare the effects of environmental factors on mosquito populations across the archipelago. It is probable that the population dynamics of A. taeniorhynchus will be similar in other islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, such as Santiago and San Cristobal, where highland mosquito populations are genetically divergent from their coastal counter-parts (Bataille et al. 2009a). However, further work is needed to determine if other islands with humid zones, like Isabela and Floreana, harbour highland-specific A. taeniorhynchus populations.
Association between environmental factors and mosquito genetic diversity
Mosquitoes in the highlands had lower Ho and allelic richness than coastal populations, which might be the result of a founder effect following the original colonization of the highlands by a small number of individuals from the coastal mosquito population. The genetic signature of such a founding event would have been lost because of the many generations that passed since the event, making it impossible to detect with a bottleneck test (Cornuet & Luikart 1996). Alternatively, or additionally to this explanation, it is possible that the number of mosquitoes in the Santa Cruz highlands is limited because of a lack of available breeding sites, as has been observed for C. quinquefasciatus in Hawaii between populations at low and middle elevations (Keyghobadi et al. 2006).
It is interesting to note that heterozygosity remained relatively high in coastal mosquito populations sampled at the time of the driest period; a time when no mosquitoes were caught in the highlands. This suggests that breeding pools filled with seawater play an important role in maintaining mosquito populations on the coast. Also, the coastal site sampled for this study was Puerto Ayora, which is the most populated town in the Galapagos Islands, so it is possible that inhabitants’ water reserves are also used as breeding sites by A. taeniorhynchus. However, the highland site of Bellavista also is populated, but no mosquitoes were caught in this site during the driest period of the study, suggesting that human water reserves alone cannot explain the resilience of coastal mosquitoes.
Temporal and geographical changes in mosquito population structure and dynamics
The results of the phylogenetic and the population structure studies conducted by Bataille et al. (2009a) showed that three highland populations in three different islands (Santa Cruz, San Cristobal and Santiago Islands) were genetically more similar to each other than to coastal populations of their own islands. It suggested that as A. taeniorhynchus colonized these islands around 200 000 years ago (Bataille et al. 2009a), it might have not only spread to occupy new ecological (highland) niches, but might also have radiated and adapted to these niches across the archipelago. In support of this hypothesis, the genetic structure of A. taeniorhynchus in Santa Cruz Island showed that coastal and highland populations were strongly differentiated from each other throughout the year. This differentiation was lowest in September 2006 and in August 2007 in terms of FST value, which corresponds to two time periods

when some gene flow was detected between coastal and highland populations. Gene flow between habitats was principally detected from coast to highlands, supporting the hypothesis that highland populations of A. taeniorhynchus may have adapted to breed specifically in fresh water and have lost their capacity to breed in salt water. Coastal mosquitoes, on the other hand, have the capacity to breed in water with a wide range of salinity and may be more apt to sporadically migrate to highland habitats. Despite some gene flow being directed from the coast towards the highlands, overall, significant signs of hybridization between coastal and highland populations were found only in coastal mosquito samples, in the form of backcrosses into the parental genetic background (see Fig. S3, Supporting information). This suggests that in the long term, hybrids are more successful on the coast because of selection or biased direction of hybridization. The potential migrant individuals from the coast to the highlands were identified as backcross between pure coast and F1 hybrids, suggesting that these individuals might possess some genetic component from the highland genetic background facilitating migration to, and ⁄ or survival in, this habitat.
A possible explanation for the fact that the migration events happened in September 2006 and in August 2007 is that precipitation was increasing in these two periods (Table 1), so more pools may have been available and mosquitoes might have emerged in high abundance at that time, although relative abundance was lower than during other months of high precipitation. Mosquito swarms resulting from synchronous emergences can be picked up by winds when at least some individuals might successfully travel long distances (Nielsen & Nielsen 1953). Alternatively, it would be interesting to investigate if strong seasonal winds occurred during the sampling periods of September 2006 and August 2007, as this might also explain this apparent seasonal migration from the coast to the highlands on Santa Cruz. Mosquito migration was also detected during other periods characterized by high precipitation (such as March and October 2006), but these mosquito movements seemed to be mainly within habitats. However, a migrant individual from the highlands was picked up in Puerto Ayora in March 2006, suggesting that some level of mosquito migration from highlands to coast exists during periods of high precipitation.
The patterns of mosquito migration observed might also be partially associated with human activity. Notably the largest amount of gene flow was found between mosquito populations sampled in Puerto Ayora and Bellavista, which are situated 3 km apart and intensively linked by human transport. However, the seasonality of the migration patterns and the close association
of mosquito abundance with environmental factors suggest that the mosquito movements observed on Santa Cruz are principally linked to natural population dynamics.
The results of the Isolation by Distance analyses suggest that the patterns of genetic distances between mosquito populations in Santa Cruz are correlated with geographical distances. However, a closer look at Fig. 3a, at the results of FST pairwise comparisons, and Bayesian clustering analysis show that genetic differentiation within coastal populations and within highland populations is much lower than that between habitats, even for populations separated by large distances. The positive correlation obtained might be because of the low number of coastal populations (two sites, seven samples) included in the analysis in comparison with highland populations (five sites, 14 samples; Table 1). It could also represent a false positive correlation produced by the presence of a barrier to gene flow between two coastal and highland panmictic populations (Guillot et al. 2009).
No F1 or F2 hybrids were identified in our samples, suggesting that such hybrids are rare between coastal and highland mosquito populations. This raises the possibility there may be pre-mating isolation barriers between the populations, either evolved, or because of spatio-temporal separation. However, hybrids are fertile as backcrossing into parental populations is relatively common. Overall these results strongly support ecological differences between habitats, acting as a selective agent driving adaptation and divergence, and maintaining long-term genetic differentiation of the populations against continuing gene flow. A growing number of studies show the possibility of trait divergence under divergent natural selection even in the presence of gene flow between populations (e.g. Ra ̈ sa ̈ nen & Hendry 2008). Aedes taeniorhynchus in Galapagos could, therefore, represent a new example of on-going incipient speciation, as has been observed in other mosquitoes, such as the Anopheles gambiae species complex (Besansky et al. 2003; Stump et al. 2005). Further studies on the ecology, morphology and physiology of A. taeniorhynchus in both habitats are warranted to understand the degree of divergence in the context of speciation.
Results from mosquito sampling show that mosquito abundance fluctuates over time, notably following precipitation and tide patterns, but evidence of such fluctuations is not clear in the genetic data. No genetic bottlenecks resulting from population size fluctuations were detected in either highland or coastal mosquito populations, but the effective population size of the coastal mosquito population was significantly reduced after a period of dry weather. While it is possible that

the small sample sizes from some of the highland sites might have limited the power of the analyses performed, these results suggest that size fluctuations in mosquito populations do not have a major effect on their genetic diversity. A possible explanation is that genetic diversity could be preserved during dry periods because of dormant eggs that can resist drought. When these eggs hatch, they replenish the allele pool of the adult mosquito population, buffering the effect of fluctuations of the adult population size on genetic diversity. To confirm that such dynamics represent a valid hypothesis to explain the patterns observed here, it should be tested using simulation models, as has been tested elsewhere with other mosquito species (Ahumada et al. 2004).
Implications for mosquito-borne disease dynamics
The results presented in this study give new insights into the fine-scale dynamics of A. taeniorhynchus mosquitoes in the Galapagos Islands, and have important implications for our understanding of vector-borne disease epidemiology and control in this World Heritage Site. Our results confirm that mosquitoes are more abundant and move more frequently when rainfall is abundant, which identifies these periods as the most probable time of vector-borne disease outbreaks in the Galapagos Islands. Another important finding is the limited movement of A. taeniorhynchus between coastal and highland habitats. This result suggests that disease dynamics might be very different in each type of habitat and that A. taeniorhynchus might be involved in different host-parasite associations specific to each environment. The on-going divergence of A. taeniorhynchus between each habitat type could have ramifications for vector competence for native pathogens, but also for pathogens that might be introduced to Galapagos, such as West Nile virus. Studies on the epidemiology of mosquito-borne diseases in Galapagos should, therefore, take into account potential differences between highland and coastal A. taeniorhynchus populations.
The divergence of A. taeniorhynchus between each habitat suggests that this mosquito species might spread an introduced mosquito-borne disease more quickly within the same type of habitat (maybe even across islands) than between habitats. Notably, coastal populations might be able to quickly spread diseases across Galapagos coasts all year round. On the other hand, disease spread within highland habitats might follow more-seasonal cycles. Importantly, dormant eggs could maintain vertically transmitted pathogens during periods of drought. Conversely, during such periods, pathogens that cannot be vertically transmitted in
A. taeniorhynchus might become locally extinct in the highlands. Mosquito movements between habitats seem to be restricted to periods of high precipitation, possibly linked to mass mosquito emergence. Therefore, the risk of disease spread across habitats will be higher during these periods. Outside these periods, disease spread would principally depend on the movement of infected hosts between habitats. This suggests that different control strategies might be needed at different time periods and in different habitats to control diseases spread by A. taeniorhynchus.
