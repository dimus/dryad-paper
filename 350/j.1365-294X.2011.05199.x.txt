Abstract
Rodent host dynamics and dispersal are thought to be critical for hantavirus epidemiology as they determine pathogen persistence and transmission within and between host populations. We used landscape genetics to investigate how the population dynamics of the bank vole Myodes glareolus, the host of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), vary with forest fragmentation and influence PUUV epidemiology. We sampled vole populations within the Ardennes, a French PUUV endemic area. We inferred demographic features such as population size, isolation and migration with regard to landscape configuration. We next analysed the influence of M. glareolus population dynamics on PUUV spatial distribution. Our results revealed that the global metapopulation dynamics of bank voles were strongly shaped by landscape features, including suitable patch size and connectivity. Large effective size in forest might therefore contribute to the higher observed levels of PUUV prevalence. By contrast, populations from hedge networks highly suffered from genetic drift and appeared strongly isolated from all other populations. This might result in high probabilities of local extinction for both M. glareolus and PUUV. Besides, we detected signatures of asymmetric bank vole migration from forests to hedges. These movements were likely to sustain PUUV in fragmented landscapes. In conclusion, our study provided arguments in favour of source-sink dynamics shaping PUUV persistence and spread in heterogeneous, Western European temperate landscapes. It illustrated the potential contribution of landscape genetics to the understanding of the epidemiological processes occurring at this local scale.

Emerging infectious diseases have an important burden on global economy and public health (Jones et al. 2008). To cope with this threat, disease ecologists strive to

determine the environmental factors that are associated with disease emergence, spread and persistence. Zoonotic infectious diseases are generally unevenly distributed in the landscape. Ecological and evolutionary processes are likely to shape this distribution as they influence the dynamics of both hosts and pathogens (Deter et al. 2010). Understanding these processes should thus improve our abilities to predict disease

emergence (Ostfeld et al. 2005). Landscape genetics is now recognized as a well-established tool to infer these ecological and evolutionary processes in spatial studies of infectious diseases (Biek & Real 2010). In particular, it may provide indirect methods to characterize host population dynamics, flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes, as well as the concurrent spread and persistence of infectious agents.
Hantaviruses are one of the main zoonotic infectious agents considered as emergent and ⁄ or re-emergent in Europe (Vapalahti et al. 2003). More than 20 distinct hantavirus species are recognized worldwide, and all are associated with either rodent or soricomorph hosts. Members of the genus are found throughout Eurasia, the Americas and Africa, where pathogenic variants are jointly responsible for up to 200 000 human clinical cases annually (Kariwa et al. 2007). Our study focused on Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), which is responsible for nephropathia epidemica (NE), a benign form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe (Vapalahti et al. 2003). NE incidence presents a high spatial variation through European continent and also at small geographical scales (Linard et al. 2007; Heyman & Vaheri 2008; Tersago et al. 2008). Temporal fluctuations of NE occurrence in human populations are related to the multi-annual cycle of density of its rodent carrier, the bank vole, Myodes glareolus (Kallio et al. 2009).
As recently advocated by Dearing & Dizney (2010), the high specificity of hantaviruses and their hosts makes host ecology a paramount determinant of the distribution of hantaviruses. Therefore, landscape features, which encompass the composition and the configuration of suitable habitats, should greatly influence the distribution of hantaviruses by determining host spatial distribution and population dynamics. Several epidemiological studies have actually highlighted the impact of landscape features on hantavirus prevalence, but various outcomes have been described. For instance, fragmented forest landscapes resulting from agriculture and forestry seem to favour higher prevalence of Sin Nombre and Calabazo hantaviruses in their respective hosts, Peromyscus maniculatus and Zygodontomys brevicauda, which are both generalist rodent species (Langlois et al. 2001; Mackelprang et al. 2001; Suzan et al. 2008). The opposite pattern may be observed when landscape features do not correspond to host favourite habitats (Lehmer et al. 2008). Forest fragmentation hence seems to decrease the prevalence of PUUV in Belgium, which probably results from bank voles preferentially living in forested habitats (Linard et al. 2007). Most of the studies documenting hantavirus landscape epidemiology have hypothesized that the key processes underlying the patterns observed are host dynamics and dispersal,
which are likely to differ with regard to landscape features (Dearing & Dizney 2010). Yet, such data have seldom (if ever) been produced, and to our knowledge, this hypothesis has never been clearly addressed.
Here, we demonstrate how landscape genetics might contribute to the understanding of hantavirus epidemiology by highlighting the influence of landscape features on rodent host dynamics and dispersal. We focus on these two parameters because they are thought to be critical for epidemiology as they determine pathogen persistence and transmission within and between host populations (Hess et al. 2002). We sampled several bank vole populations in forested landscapes that are fragmented to different degrees, from plain, continuous forests to hedge networks. We monitored hantavirus prevalence using indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and host demographic processes using landscape genetics. We hypothesized that habitat fragmentation should affect the ecology of bank voles by limiting dispersal and population size, and by increasing local extinction. Our hypothesis involved that fragmented landscapes should constitute sink habitats, characterized by frequent local extinction ⁄ colonization of bank voles and PUUV. By contrast, forested areas would constitute favourable habitats for PUUV, with sufficiently large vole populations maintaining high PUUV prevalence.
Material and methods
Sampling methods
The study area is located in the French Ardennes, an endemic region of HFRS. The sampling was done in autumn 2008 along a transect line of about 80 km (Fig. 1) corresponding to a north–south negative gradient of NE cases (Sauvage et al. 2002). Along this transect, we sampled six sites in forested areas and four sites in fragmented habitats (i.e. hedge network, Fig. 1). The minimum distance between sites was 3.2 km. Each site corresponded to an area of about 2 km2 and was sampled using 6–12 lines of 20 live-traps set at 10-m intervals. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation as recommended by Mills et al. (1995). They were weighted, sexed and dissected. Lungs were placed in RNAlater (Sigma) and stored at )20 °C for genetic analyses. Blood samples were collected from the heart or the thoracic cavity on a 1-cm2 Whatman blotting paper for PUUV antibody detection.

Molecular analyses
Genomic DNA was extracted from a piece of lung using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions with a final elution of 100 lL water. Samples were genotyped at 19 unlinked microsatellite loci published by Rikalainen et al. (2008). Several primers were redesigned for multiplexing (see details in Table S1, Supporting information). Amplifications were performed in a 10-lL reaction volume containing 1 lL DNA, 5 lL 2· Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix and 0.2 lM of each primer. The microsatellite cycling protocol (Qiagen) was 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 30s, 57°C for 90s, 72°C for 60s and a final extension step at 60 °C for 10 min. Genotyping was carried out using an ABI3130 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Alleles were scored
using GENEMAPPER software (Applied Biosystems). Genetic analyses have been repeated for 18 samples (i.e. about 5% of the total number) randomly chosen to estimate the repeatability of the genotyping. Repeatability was 100% for all loci except Cg13G2, Cg13F9, Cg13C12, Cg2C5 (one difference) and Cg12A7 (four differences). Three loci were excluded from the genetic analyses: Cg16H5 and Cg5F11 because of the poor quality of profiles, and Cg16A3 because of the presence of null alleles. Our final data set included genotypes obtained at 16 microsatellite loci. We performed genetic analyses on the 310 individuals genotyped. It should be noted that we got complete genotypes for 291 samples. The number of PCR amplification failure per loci ranged between 0% and 2% depending on the loci considered.
Statistical analyses
Fine spatial scale analyses. Different statistical analyses were conducted at a fine spatial scale (i.e. within sites).

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was tested for each pair of loci and sites using the genotypic LD test implemented in GENEPOP v4.0 (Rousset 2008). Conformity to Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was assessed within localities for each locus (by randomization of alleles among individuals within localities) using the software FSTAT v2.9 (Goudet 1995). To account for the very large number of tests, we estimated, separately for LD and HWE data sets, the false discovery rate (FDR), which is less conservative than the Bonferroni correction while controlling for the proportion of false positives (Benjamini & Hochberg 1995). We quantified deviation from HWE using FIS estimation. We next explored the potential existence of genetic structure within each sampling site: we estimated the spatial autocorrelation of genetic relatedness considering seven intervals of upper bounds equal to 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000 and 2000 m. We used Wang relatedness coefficient (Wang 2002) for its high accuracy (low bias) and high precision (low variance). For each interval, significance was assessed using permutation tests implemented in the software SPAGEDI v1.2 (Hardy & Vekemans 2002).
We determined genetic diversity within each site by estimating observed (HO) and Nei’s unbiased expected (HE) heterozygosities using GENETIX v4.05 (Belkhir et al. 2002). The allelic richness (A) was estimated using a rarefaction procedure to correct for sample sizes, using FSTAT. We compared allelic richness and heterozygosity among habitats (forest vs. hedge networks) using nonparametric Wilcoxon tests implemented in R 2.6.01 software (R Development Core Team 2007). Assuming that habitat fragmentation should increase genetic drift and deplete gene flow, we expected lower levels of genetic diversity in hedge networks than in forest sites of sampling.
Large-scale genetic clustering methods. We looked for genetic disruption within the studied area using spatial and nonspatial methods. We estimated the number of genetic clusters using the Bayesian assignment approaches implemented in STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000) and GENELAND (Guillot et al. 2005) softwares. The data set was subdivided into clusters by maximizing HWE and minimizing LD. Inferences from STRUCTURE were based on genetic data alone, whereas GENELAND explicitly incorporated spatial organization information for genotyped individuals.
Using STRUCTURE, we assumed an admixture model inferring separate alpha value for each population and correlated allelic frequencies between populations with a fixed lambda value (k = 1.0). The number of populations (K) was fixed. We performed 100 independent runs for K=1 to K=10 with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) of 600 000 iterations following a burn-in
of 300 000 iterations. We used the Greedy algorithm implemented in CLUMPP v 1.1.1 (Jakobsson & Rosenberg 2007) to compute the pairwise ‘symmetric similarity coefficient’ (G’) between pairs of runs to identify potential distinct modes among the results of the 100 STRUCTURE runs for each K value. We considered pairs of runs with G’ > 0.8 as belonging to the same mode. We then averaged for each individual i, the proportions of genotype membership among all runs in the same mode for a given K value (Qij; j = 1 to K). We used these averaged results to build summary bar plots for each value and each mode, using the program DISTRUCT v 1.1 (Rosenberg 2004). Finally, for each run, we calculated the mean posterior probability. We then used this mean posterior probability for each K value to determine the number of clusters best fitting our multilocus genetic data set using the method described by Evanno et al. (2005).
Using GENELAND, we selected the spatial and the correlated allele frequency models. We processed 10 independent runs with 500 000 iterations (thinning = 50) allowing the number of genetic cluster (K) to vary between one and 10. Lambda was fixed to 100 and the maximum number of Poisson–Voronoi tessellation to 300. We attached an uncertainty on the coordinates of 2 km. The posterior probability of each run was computed with 100 000 iterations. The best K was assessed on the modal value of the run with the highest posterior probability.
Genetic admixture and immigration within sites. The estimation of genetic admixture was carried out for each site using the outputs of the Bayesian analyses performed in STRUCTURE. For each site, we determined the major genetic cluster as the one that was the most represented in the greatest number of individuals. We then estimated the mean and variance of Qi values (i.e. individual proportions of genotype membership) to this major genetic cluster. Mean Qi values were expected to be high and Qi variance values to be low within lowly admixed sites, while the reverse was expected in highly admixed sites.
We used a two-step procedure for detecting immigrants within sites. We used Qi < 0.30 as a threshold for defining immigrants coming from a different genetic cluster. Those individuals were removed from the data set, and first-generation immigrants in each site were then detected using assignment tests in GENECLASS2 (Piry et al. 2004). It should be noted that we avoided applying the assignment tests before the removal of individuals with low Qi values because some of the populations were highly admixed (i.e. exhibited high proportions of immigrants coming from highly genetically differentiated source populations). In such cases, the method
Ó 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

implemented in GENECLASS2 may not efficiently characterize the genetic structure of the reference population. This might affect the output of the assignment tests.
Using GENECLASS2, we computed for each individual its likelihood of belonging to the site where it was sampled (i.e. the Lh statistics) as recommended when all sources for immigrants have not necessarily been sampled (Paetkau et al. 2004) using the frequency method. For each individual, we inferred its probability of being resident using a Monte Carlo resampling procedure. Individuals with a probability lower than 0.01 were excluded as residents.
Large-scale isolation by distance. We tested the effects of landscape features on gene flow by testing isolation by distance (IBD) patterns. We first considered all sites, whatever they were sampled in forest or hedge network habitats. We next only included the sites sampled in forest. Following Frantz et al. (2010), we hypothesized that forest fragmentation should increase local genetic drift and weaken the linear relationships between genetic differentiation and geographical distance. A Mantel test based on 1000 permutations was performed using GENEPOP v4.0 (Rousset 2008) to assess the significance of the regression between pairwise genetic differentiation FST ⁄ (1 ) FST) and logarithm of the geographic distance.
Genetic isolation of local populations. For each site, we estimated local FST values with 95% confidence interval using the method proposed by Foll & Gaggiotti (2006) and implemented in the software GESTE. The GESTE method is robust for the deviation from HWE, and results should not be influenced by the small estimates of FIS we observed in our populations (O. Gaggiotti & M. Foll, personal communication). The local FST estimate is an index of the level of genetic isolation of each site with regard to all other ones. We then compared the isolation of the different sites with regard to their landscape features (forest vs. hedge networks) using a Wilcoxon test implemented in R 2.6.01 software. Again, we hypothesized that hedge networks should be more genetically isolated than forest sites, mainly because of a stronger importance of genetic drift.
Epidemiological features. We explored the correlation between PUUV prevalence and genetic parameters estimated for each site, with the idea that genetic parameters could be used as surrogates of demographic features including population size and migration. Significant correlations should indicate strong effects of host population dynamics on PUUV epidemiology. Considering all variables separately might have ham-
pered this analysis because of both potential interdependence among variables (i.e. multicollinearity, see Graham 2003) and inflation of detecting spurious correlations because of high numbers of statistical tests (i.e. inflation of type I error, see Roback & Askins 2005). To limit these drawbacks, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) implemented in STATISTICA v8.0.550 software (StatSoft, Inc 2007) to generate a small number of uncorrelated synthetic variables (principal components, PCs). PCs were uncorrelated linear combinations of the original variables explaining most of the variation in the covariates. We performed a logistic regression with PUUV prevalence as the variable to explain. The explanatory variables included in the complete model were the first three PCs variables and the latitude of sampling site as there is a north–south negative gradient of NE cases. Model was selected using the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC, Burnham & Anderson 1998; Johnson & Omland 2004). Models with difference of AIC < 2 compared to the model with the lowest AIC were considered. Among these models, we selected the most parsimonious as the one with fewest parameters. The significance of each explanatory variable was tested using Wald tests based on z values.
Results
Fine-scale genetic structure
The 310 bank voles were genotyped for 16 microsatellites. After FDR procedure, we found one to four pairs of loci per site exhibiting significant LD. The pairs of loci concerned were not consistent among sites. Among the tests for deviation from HWE, the estimated overall proportion of true null hypotheses was 0.95 (152 over 160 tests). The eight tests with the lowest q-values concerned the locus Cg2F2 (four tests), the locus Cg13C1 (three tests) and the locus Cg16E4 (one test). We found a significant deficit of heterozygotes over all loci into two sites (Cliron and Sauville). Multilocus FIS estimates ranged from )0.006 to 0.093 (Table 1). Given our sampling procedure, which involved the use of several lines distributed in the landscape, we suspected the existence of some genetic structure in our samples that could explain the positive FIS values in most sites. This hypothesis was actually supported by the spatial autocorrelation analyses. Indeed, we found significantly higher levels of relatedness (P < 0.05) within the first interval distance (<100 m, i.e. inferior to the length of our trap lines) than in any other interval distance in all sites, except Croix-aux-Bois, Boult-aux-Bois and Briquenay (Fig. S1, Supporting information).
Finally, both heterozygosity and allelic richness strongly differed among sampling sites (Table 1). Alle-

lic richness and expected heterozygosity were higher in forests than in hedge networks (A: Wilcoxon test, P = 0.02, Fig. 2; HE, Wilcoxon test, P = 0.03) but not observed heterozygosity (HO, Wilcoxon test, P = 0.35).
Large-scale genetic clustering
Bayesian clustering analyses revealed a likely structure of three or four genetic clusters (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, Supporting information). For K = 3 clusters, the different runs had very similar log posterior probabilities ()24 813.9 ± 4.3). The data set was divided into a large cluster including all sites belonging to forested areas and two other small clusters, each one corresponding to a different site of hedge network (Cliron and Sauville). For K = 4, CLUMPP analyses revealed two different modes. The first mode included 20 runs with high log posterior probabilities ()24 792.6 ± 38.1, i.e. the same order of magnitude than for K = 3). It displayed a population structure that was very similar to the mode for K = 3 but presented one more cluster corresponding to a hedge network site (Boult-aux-Bois) (Fig. 3b). The second mode for K = 4 included 80 runs with very low log posterior probabilities ()25 504.0 ± 229.8, i.e. a difference of 711.4 with the first mode). It displayed a population structure where two clusters were widely represented in most of the individuals and where the assignments were roughly symmetric to all populations, and no individuals are strongly assigned. In such case, Pritchard et al. (2010) recommends being sceptical about the structure inferred (page 17 of the documentation for STRUCTURE software). We thus decided to not retain the solutions of this second mode for two reasons: first, because the log posterior probabilities were very low for these runs compared with the values observed for the first mode; second, because such population structure was considered as dubious by Pritchard et al. Finally, our analyses suggested a structure of three or four clusters, one including all forest sites and a site in hedge network (Briquenay), and the

others including each one a hedge network site (Cliron, Sauville and Boult-aux-Bois). We next followed the recommendations of Pritchard et al. (2010) to determine whether Boult-aux-Bois was really isolated from the other sites. We reran the analysis using only the individuals from the southern sites (Croix-aux-Bois, Boultaux-Bois and Briquenay). We found higher log posterior probabilities for K = 2 ()5 347.6 ± 271.5) in comparison with K = 1 ()5 387.4 ± 1.1), supporting the isolation of most individuals from Boult-aux-Bois into a separated cluster.
The spatial Bayesian clustering method with GENELAND inferred the presence of eight genetic clusters (Fig. S3, Supporting information): six corresponded each one to a different sampling site (Hargnies, Woiries, Renwez, Cliron, Sauville and Boult-aux-Bois) and two clusters corresponded each one to two different groups of two
sites (Elan and Cassine; Croix-aux-Bois and Briquenay, respectively). Although not truly incompatible, the genetic partitions given by STRUCTURE and GENELAND differed by the number of clusters. The difference could result from an overstructuring of the GENELAND method because of the IBD pattern that prevailed over our study area and ⁄ or our highly irregular sampling scheme (see Guillot & Santos 2009). We thus further referred to the STRUCTURE results.
Detection of genetic admixture and immigration
Admixture level in each site was estimated by analysing the individual proportions of genotype membership (Qi) provided by STRUCTURE. We used the average values of the 20 runs of the first mode for K = 4 (see earlier for details). Most sites sampled in forests displayed

high mean Qi values and low standard deviation, both indicative of low levels of admixture (Fig. 2). By contrast, hedge networks generally exhibited low Qi values and high standard deviation, as a result of high admixture (Fig. 2).
Altogether the two methods used for immigrant detection allowed the determination of 42 immigrants. The clustering approach allowed detecting high proportions of individuals from hedge networks that were genetically assigned to forests (5–38%). The opposite (i.e. individuals from forests that were genetically assigned to hedge networks) was much less frequent (0–10%) (Table 2, Fig. 2). Then, assignment tests allowed the detection of a few more immigrants (0–3 individuals) in each site, with no clear differences among hedge networks and forests.
Large-scale isolation by distance
No significant pattern of IBD was detected when all sites were included in the analysis (Mantel test, P = 0.23, Fig. S4, Supporting information). By contrast, the relationship became significant when the sites sampled in the hedge networks were removed from the analysis (Mantel test, P = 0.04, Fig. S4, Supporting information). Interestingly, most of the pairwise comparisons involving at least one hedge site appeared well above the linear curve representing the significant IBD pattern (Fig. S4, Supporting information). This reflected that for similar geographic distances, pairwise genetic
differentiation was higher when at least one hedge site was included.
Genetic isolation of local populations
The analyses of local FST estimates corroborated this pattern of a stronger genetic isolation in hedge networks than in forests (Fig. 2 and Fig. S5, Supporting information). Values ranged from 0.011 to 0.025 in forests and from 0.027 to 0.056 in hedge networks. Considering 95% confidence intervals, this analysis indicated significantly higher values of local FST in the hedge network sites of Cliron, Sauville and Boult-aux-Bois, than in the forest sites (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.01).
Epidemiological features
Among the 310 bank voles caught, 274 were tested for PUUV infection (the difference was because of the difficulty in collecting blood samples for some voles). Thirty-seven voles were PUUV seropositive. Seroprevalence greatly varied between sites, from low values in hedge networks (0–10%) to high values in forests (8– 43%) (Table 1, Fig. 2). We got evidence of five PUUVseropositive migrants distributed in four different sites (three forests and one hedge network, Table 2). In the site of Cliron (hedge), two immigrants assigned to the nearby forest were actually PUUV seropositive.

 58.3% of the variability. From the contribution values (Table 3) and the correlation circle (Fig. 4a), PC1 could be interpreted as a synthetic variable representing the local impact of genetic drift. It contrasted sites with high genetic diversities (A and HO) and low genetic isolation (FST) from sites with low genetic diversities and high genetic isolation. It well discriminated forest sites (negative coordinates) from hedge networks (positive coordinates) (Fig. 4b). PC2 accounted for 37.2% of the total variability. It mainly represented the genetic parameters reflecting the deviation from HWE within site (HO and FIS). PC2 then represented the within-site genetic structure of the samples, either spatial or family structures. Finally, PC3 only accounted for 3.7% of the variability.

(Fig. 4). After the selection procedure, the model with the lowest AIC (AIC = 41.9, residual Dev2,7 = 12.1) included the PC1 variable (z value = )3.1, P = 0.002) and the latitude (z value = 1.7, P = 0.086). The most parsimonious model with fewer parameters (AIC = 43.1, residual Dev1,8 = 15.3) only included PC1, which significantly explained PUUV prevalence (z value = )4.1, P = 3.75 · 10)5). The PCA analysis thus suggested that PUUV prevalence was strongly related to local vole demography, with high PUUV prevalence maintained in sites exhibiting low genetic drift and low PUUV prevalence observed in sites displaying high genetic drift.
Discussion
Our study illustrates the potential contribution of landscape genetics to the understanding of the epidemiological processes occurring in heterogeneous landscapes. We were able to relate landscape structure and virus prevalence with several demographically meaningful genetic parameters indicative of rodent host dynamics. Our data well supported the hypothesis that higher seroprevalence of PUUV was reached in large, continuous host populations, characterized by high genetic diversity and low genetic isolation. By contrast, low levels of PUUV seroprevalence were found in small and isolated host populations, characterized by low genetic diversity and high genetic isolation. Moreover, genetic clustering

analyses suggested that immigration from large, continuous populations into small, isolated ones could be an essential process in the occurrence of PUUV in fragmented landscapes. Altogether our study advocated the central role of local host dynamics, and in particular population size, isolation and migration, in the epidemiology of PUUV in Western European fragmented temperate forest landscapes.
Bank vole metapopulation dynamics and landscape fragmentation
Our landscape genetic approach revealed that Myodes glareolus populations in this study area can be considered as a global metapopulation, composed of patches of variable effective sizes and linked by more or less important gene flow. Indeed, we found that bank vole populations sampled in large forest tracts were almost genetically homogeneous, displaying only a slight IBD pattern, even though they were actually separated by large nonforested habitats (like openfields in the southern part). Such large-scale genetic homogeneity, even in the presence of effective barriers to dispersal, may first look surprising. Yet, this pattern was recently documented for the common vole, Microtus arvalis, a smallsize rodent inhabiting agricultural landscapes (Gauffre et al. 2008). Using computer simulations, Gauffre et al. (2008) demonstrated that recent anthropogenic barriers to dispersal could not significantly impact the spatial structure of the genetic variability for species exhibiting large effective population size. This explanation could also hold in our study area. Bank voles may actually have considerably large effective population size within wide forest tracts, and this assumption was corroborated by the high genetic diversity observed in forest sites.
By contrast, bank vole populations sampled in hedge networks within fragmented landscapes displayed strong signals of genetic isolation and lower genetic diversities. Three of four populations sampled in hedge networks were genetically distinct from the closest population sampled in a large forest. This genetic pattern revealed local gene flow ⁄ genetic drift disequilibrium within fragmented habitats, indicative of strong genetic drift in hedge networks. This interpretation was also supported by the erasing of the IBD pattern when including populations from hedge networks in the data set. We then confidently concluded that bank vole populations in hedge networks actually suffered from high genetic drift probably resulting from small effective population sizes within such habitats.
Previous ecological studies were in line with our results. Combined analyses of environmental features
and bank vole distribution have demonstrated that population densities are habitat dependent, with lower densities in habitats composed of low food–producing plants and trees (Lo ̈fgren 1996; Linard et al. 2007; Heyman et al. 2009). Hedges were often considered to be of lower quality for the bank vole than adjacent forests (Hinsley & Bellamy 2000). Moreover, bank vole densities also seemed to be positively associated with the connectivity of habitats (Gelling et al. 2007; Mortelliti et al. 2009). Our study provided congruent conclusions with the capture–mark–recapture study by Paillat & Butet (1996) who evidenced an association between local extinction of bank vole populations in fragmented landscapes and both the size and connectivity of hedge fragments.
Asymmetric gene flow from large forests to hedge networks
Clustering analyses revealed that strong signatures of asymmetric gene flow from forests to hedge networks. First, we detected high genetic admixture within populations sampled in hedge networks, suggesting that these populations resulted from several independent genetic pools. By contrast, we did not detect such signature when considering populations sampled in large forest tracts. Moreover, a high proportion of individuals sampled in hedge networks were actually assigned to the forest genetic cluster (up to 38% of individuals), while the opposite (individuals in forests actually assigned to hedge networks) was substantially lower (<10% in all sampling sites). Finally, the proportions of immigrants, obtained by combining clustering and assignation methods, were systematically higher in hedge networks than in forests. However, this important immigration (at least in terms of proportion relative to residents) was not enough to compensate for the genetic drift occurring in hedge networks. We could then assume that this immigration was not effective, either because immigrants accessed to reproduction with difficulty, or because they produced lowly fit offspring.
Our data then corroborated the widely accepted view that hedge networks would host ‘sink’ populations of small mammals (Tattersall et al. 2004). Temporal changes in dispersal rate throughout density cycles have been suggested for voles (Berthier et al. 2006; Linard et al. 2007). It is therefore possible that such asymmetric gene flow could vary through years. Finally, direct estimations of bank vole dispersal are in agreement with our genetic data. Despite their moderate body size, bank voles can move long distances, up to 1– 3 km (Szacki & Liro 1991; Razzauti et al. 2008). Kozakiewicz et al. (2007) even recorded more movements

of bank voles from forests to other habitats in mosaic landscapes, than opposite movements.
PUUV epidemiology: the source-sink epidemiological hypothesis
Determining the potential impacts of host metapopulation dynamics on the spread and persistence of infectious diseases is a main theme in epidemiology (Park et al. 2002; Cross et al. 2005; Jesse et al. 2008). In this context, the application of landscape genetics to the study of bank vole populations did not only improve our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping the distribution of M. glareolus in heterogeneous environment. It also allowed highlighting the bank vole dynamic features that drove, at least partially, the spatial distribution of PUUV within these fragmented landscapes. Our study hence provided strong evidence of the role of M. glareolus metapopulation structure and dynamics on the probability of transmission and persistence of PUUV in the different landscape features surveyed.
PUUV spreading among landscapes. Our results evidenced the occurrence of immigrants that were PUUV seropositive. Although we could not determine whether those immigrants were infected before, during or after dispersal, this result nevertheless established the likelihood of PUUV propagation through vole dispersal within and between landscapes. Interestingly, we also evidenced two migrants from forest to hedge networks, which were seropositive in the site of Cliron. This observation was in agreement with the hypothesis that forests were ‘source’ populations for PUUV transmission in hedgerows (irrespective of the fact that a concurrent in situ transmission might also occur within hedge networks).
PUUV persistence within landscapes. The question of pathogen persistence is at the core of infectious disease epidemiology. It is also a common issue of the metapopulation theory in which the balance between extinction and recolonization influences the persistence of patchily distributed populations (Grenfell & Harwood 1997). Therefore, the persistence of infections in local subpopulations depends on stochastic events that become more important as these subpopulations are of smaller size. This is in agreement with the concept of threshold levels of host abundance (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005), below which there are not enough hosts to sustain the infectious agent. Our study revealed that bank vole populations settled in hedge networks exhibited lower levels of PUUV seroprevalence and were submit-
ted to strong genetic drift. We could therefore suggest that the persistence of PUUV in these fragmented habitats was hampered by the strong stochasticity experienced by bank vole populations living in this environment. The presence of PUUV in hedgerows would thus mainly be explained by the regular introduction of immigrants originating from forests, which became infected either in their natal habitat or during their dispersal.
These results seemed coherent with several effects derived from some models of infectious disease dynamics within metapopulations (see review by Grenfell & Harwood 1997). They may reflect both the positive influence of habitat connectivity on the ability of infectious agents to persist and the crucial role of relatively small rates of host movements between habitats, potentially through the ‘rescue effect’ (e.g. Hanski 1999; Jesse et al. 2008). Besides, they may also suggest important directions for future potential improvements of these models, including the variability of dispersal behaviours between individuals (juveniles ⁄ adults, infected ⁄ non infected, see the study by Jesse & Heesterbeek 2011) or the heterogeneity in landscape and habitat patch qualities.
Other environmental factors could accentuate these different patterns of PUUV persistence in forests and hedge networks. First, the indirect transmission of PUUV via contaminated environment is now recognized as an important route of infection (Kallio et al. 2006) and an important determinant of PUUV persistence in bank vole populations (Sauvage et al. 2003; Linard et al. 2007). PUUV can survive and remain infectious for 15 days at room temperature, and probably much longer in cold and moist environments (Kallio et al. 2006). Such environmental conditions might be found in forests, but we could believe that the hedge networks were more exposed to important variations in temperature, humidity and UV radiation. In consequence, we could suggest that forest habitat fragmentation might also alter the environmental conditions required for PUUV survival outside its hosts and as such for its persistence in hedgerows. Second, the interaction with other parasites might also indirectly influence the distribution of PUUV in bank voles within heterogeneous landscapes. Co-infections are known to modulate the immune responses to new infections (Schulenburg et al. 2009). In particular, helminth infections generally polarize the Th2 immune pathway that is an antagonist mechanism of defence against most viral infections (Kamal & Khalifa 2006). The composition of helminth community of these bank vole populations from the Ardennes has been examined and Ribas Salvador et al. (2011) provided evidence of a relationship with landscape features. They specially

highlighted concomitant infections between PUUV and Heligmosomum mixtum, what suggested the potential effect of this helminth parasite infection on bank vole susceptibility to PUUV. Environmental factors affecting helminth distribution might then indirectly influence the distribution of PUUV within landscapes.
Mosaic of co-evolution between bank vole populations and PUUV
Finally, our results also gave some indications that ecological conditions were set for a mosaic of co-evolution between M. glareolus populations and PUUV in this fragmented environment. At the landscape scale, the spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors plays an important role in co-evolutionary processes shaping the pattern of mosaic selection (Thompson 1999). Selection is an important evolutionary force determining spatial disease distribution and dynamics (Deter et al. 2010). Theoretical models predict that population size and migration, influencing genetic drift and gene flow, are two major factors influencing the potential for local adaptation (Gandon et al. 2008). On these assumptions, our results suggested that the strong genetic drift occurring in fragmented habitats should impede the potential selective impact of PUUV on its reservoir. By contrast, in large forests, the weak genetic drift and the low immigration of voles from hedge habitats could lead to local adaptation.
Perspectives
Landscape genetics of population reservoir provides essential information to understand epidemiological processes driving the spatial distribution of pathogens. By demonstrating the impact of landscape features on bank vole metapopulation structure, we provided indications of source-sink dynamics shaping PUUV persistence and spread in Western European temperate landscapes. Corresponding studies are being carried out by our joint team in the homogenous boreal taiga landscapes, which could add understanding for the high incidence of NE in North Europe. Finally, we inferred the neutral evolutionary forces underlying these patterns and potentially affecting bank vole⁄PUUV co-evolution. Several immune genes of Myodes glareolus are known to be associated with the balance of resistance ⁄ tolerance to PUUV infection (Deter et al. 2008; Guivier et al. 2010a,b). Further investigations are necessary to explore the polymorphism of these immune genes and its distribution in fragmented habitats. It will give insights into the potential existence of local adaptation, which could affect PUUV epidemiological processes.
