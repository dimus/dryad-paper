Abstract
Studies of interactions between farmed and wild salmonid fishes have suggested reduced fitness of farmed strains in the wild, but evidence for selection at the genic level is lacking. We studied three brown trout populations in Denmark which have been significantly admixed with stocked hatchery trout (19–64%), along with two hatchery strains used for stocking. The wild populations were represented by contemporary samples (2000–2006) and two of them by historical samples (1943–1956). We analysed 61 microsatellite loci, nine of which showed putative functional relationships [expressed sequence tag (EST)-linked or quantitative trait loci]. FST-based outlier tests provided support for diversifying selection at chromosome regions marked by three loci, two anonymous and one EST-linked. Patterns of differentiation suggested that the loci were candidates for being under diversifying hitch-hiking selection in hatchery vs. wild environments. Analysis of hatchery strain admixture proportions showed that in one wild population, two of the loci showed significantly lower admixture proportions than the putatively neutral loci, implying contemporary selection against alleles introduced by hatchery strain trout. In the most strongly admixed population, however, there was no evidence for selection, possibly because of immigration by stocked trout overcoming selection against hatchery-derived alleles or supportive breeding practices allowing hatchery strain trout to escape natural selection. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating footprints of selection in wild salmonid populations subject to spawning intrusion by farmed fish.

Introduction
One of the major challenges in evolutionary biology lies in clarifying the interactions between genetic and environmental variation, whereby locally varying selection regimes potentially lead to local adaptation (Kawecki & Ebert 2004). Recent statistical and conceptual developments have greatly facilitated studies aimed at detecting selection both at the quantitative genetic (Leinonen et al. 2008) and genome levels (Beaumont & Balding 2004; Storz 2005; Vasema ̈gi & Primmer 2005; Nosil et al. 2009). This has led to an increasing number of empirical

studies aimed at demonstrating local adaptation using ‘top-down’ approaches by analysing quantitative traits (Storz 2002; Palo et al. 2003; Jensen et al. 2008a) or ‘bottom-up’ approaches using analysis of candidate genes or genome scans (Campbell & Bernatchez 2004; Vasema ̈gi et al. 2005; Bonin et al. 2006; Ma ̈kinen et al. 2008; Namroud et al. 2008). A handful of studies have even combined both types of approaches and thereby approached the ultimate goal of unravelling the full dynamics involved in local adaptation, from genotype to phenotype and environment (Nachman et al. 2003; Colosimo et al. 2005; Rogers & Bernatchez 2007; Schulte 2007).
Some of the most abrupt changes of selection regimes experienced by populations occur because of anthropo-

genic translocations from one environment to another. Moreover, admixture between wild indigenous populations and translocated or escaped exogenous conspecifics is an increasingly serious problem in conservation biology (Allendorf et al. 2001; Edmands 2007; Randi 2008). The problems are exacerbated when the exogenous populations are propagated in captivity, which may involve intentional or unintentional domestication selection leading to decreased fitness of individuals that escape or are released to the wild (Araki et al. 2008; Hutchings & Fraser 2008). If interbreeding between wild and captive populations takes place, then this may impose a genetic load on the admixed individuals that decreases the mean fitness of the wild populations (Lynch & O’Hely 2001). It should be noted although that a recent case of adaptive colour variation has been described in wolves (Canis lupus lupus) that derives from interbreeding with domestic dogs (C. lupus familiaris) (Anderson et al. 2009). There may be other similar cases of introduction of adaptive variation of domesticated origin (Hedrick 2009), but this must be considered the exception rather than the rule. Scenarios where population translocation leads to admixture between genetically divergent populations can both be considered as inadvertent large-scale experiments and as significant conservation problems. It is therefore of considerable interest to analyse selection at the molecular genetic level in wild-captive population interactions.
Salmonid fishes are among the organisms most affected by gene flow from captive to wild populations. The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming industry has expanded strongly during the past decades with frequent accidental escapes of farmed fish as a negative by-product (Jonsson & Jonsson 2006). Moreover, in
many salmonid species there is a long tradition of compensating population declines of wild populations by stocking fish of hatchery strain origin (Hindar et al. 1991; Hansen et al. 2001). The resultant genetic interactions have mainly been studied through two lines of research, the first of which involves experiments in captive or semi-natural settings aimed at comparing fitness of wild, farmed and admixed individuals (McGinnity et al. 2003; McLean et al. 2003; Araki et al. 2007; Fraser et al. 2008). These studies have generally concluded that farmed populations show decreased fitness relative to wild populations, although the fitness differences differ considerably among the specific life stages. The second line of research involves ‘opportunistic’ studies of admixture in wild populations subject to stocking or escapes of farmed fish, based on analysis of putatively neutral molecular markers (Hansen 2002; Susnik et al. 2004; Almodovar et al. 2006; Matala et al. 2008; Hansen & Mensberg 2009; Hansen et al. 2009). Several of these studies have documented surprisingly low genetic contribution by translocated populations, although it is also evident that significant admixture may occur, presumably depending on the immigration rate of farmed fish and local variation in environmental conditions. Specifically for this type of study, it is difficult to disentangle genetically based selection from nongenetic maladaptation of farmed fish due to circumstances of stocking or hatchery-rearing (Hansen 2002).
In this study, we combined ‘opportunistic’ analysis of stocked populations with approaches to identify footprints of selection in brown trout (Salmo trutta) hatchery strains and wild populations before and after stocking. We focused on three populations in rivers in western Jutland, Denmark (see Fig. 1), which have been stocked

with 100 000s of trout from one particular hatchery strain from the 1970s until 2000. Previous studies based on historical (1940–50s) and contemporary samples have shown that the Skjern River population is highly admixed (64%) with hatchery strain trout, whereas the two other populations, the Storaa and Kongeaa Rivers are more moderately admixed (21% and 19%, respectively; Hansen et al. 2009). We analysed variation at 61 microsatellite loci in historical (1943–1956) and contemporary samples of wild trout populations and in two hatchery strains, one of which was used for stocking the rivers. Fifty-two loci had no known functional relationships, whereas nine loci were either known to be linked to functional genes or had been identified as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in other salmonids.
We tested the hypothesis that selection acts at the genetic level against hatchery strain trout stocked into the wild and that footprints of selection are consequently evident in hatchery–wild trout genetic interactions. Commercial brown trout hatchery strains in Denmark have often been reared for more than 50 years in closed systems with no subsequent gene flow from wild populations (Hansen et al. 2001). The hatchery environments differ fundamentally from those in the wild, potentially leading to inadvertent selection at a number of traits. For instance, most strains have been founded from anadromous (sea trout) populations, but have subsequently been kept exclusively in fresh water. Our expectation therefore was that diversifying selection should primarily be evident between wild populations vs. hatchery strains rather than among wild populations from the same region, owing to large differences between captive and wild environments. Furthermore, we expected that if strong selection acts against stocked hatchery trout, then loci showing footprints of selection between historical wild populations and hatchery strains should also show evidence of diversifying selection between contemporary wild and hatchery populations, despite recent admixture.
Materials and methods
Samples and populations
We analysed anadromous brown trout populations from the Storaa (STO), Skjern (SKJ) and Kongeaa (KON) Rivers. The localities of the rivers, sample sizes, sampling years and sample abbreviations are shown in Fig. 1. Contemporary samples consisted of adipose fin clips of electrofished spawning anadromous trout caught in November–January 2000–2006. Historical pre-stocking samples consisted of dried scales from anadromous trout caught in 1943–56. We only analysed
historical samples from STO and SKJ. Historical samples were also available from KON, but low quantities of DNA precluded us from analysing many loci.
We also analysed contemporary samples from the Haarkaer (HAR) and Vork (VOR) hatchery strains. The HAR strain has been used for stocking the three studied populations, whereas VOR has been stocked into other rivers of the region and was included as a reference population. The two strains are both supposed to have been founded by anadromous trout from rivers in Eastern Jutland. VOR was founded around 1880, whereas the time of founding of HAR is unknown but certainly dates back before 1960. Exchange of fish between the two strains is known to have taken place in the 1970s (Hansen et al. 2001). The analysed individuals represent a subset of samples analysed by Hansen et al. (2009) and Hansen & Mensberg (2009), but screened for variation at a higher number of loci.
Molecular analyses
DNA from contemporary samples was extracted using the DNeasyTM kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA from historical scale samples was extracted according to Nielsen et al. (1999) with the phenol–chloroform extraction steps replaced by use of the DNeasyTM kit.
We analysed 61 loci developed for salmonid fishes of the genera Salmo and Oncorhynchus. These included two microsatellite loci in expressed sequence tags (EST), CA058586 and CA060208 which have previously been suggested to be under diversifying selection in Atlantic salmon (Vasema ̈gi et al. 2005); the EST-linked locus Hsp (GenBank Accession number CV428908), which is found in a gene showing homology to a heat shock protein coding gene; and UBA which is embedded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I gene (Grimholt et al. 2002) and has previously been suggested to be under diversifying selection in brown trout (Hansen et al. 2007). Furthermore, five loci were analysed which are putative QTLs in other salmonids: Ssa14DU and Ssa119NVH, which have been identified as upper temperature tolerance QTLs in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (Jackson et al. 1998) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) (Somorjai et al. 2003), and of which Ssa14DU has been suggested to be under diversifying selection in Atlantic salmon (Vasema ̈gi et al. 2005); Ssa85, which has been identified as a QTL for both upper temperature tolerance and spawning time difference in rainbow trout (Danzmann et al. 1999; Sakamoto et al. 1999) and has been suggested to be under diversifying selection in rainbow trout (Aguilar & Garza 2006) and brown trout (Jensen et al. 2008b); Onel8, which is a QTL for infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) resistance in rainbow trout

(Rodriguez et al. 2004); and Str58CNRS, which is a QTL for body weight in Atlantic salmon (Reid et al. 2005). Among the remaining 52 loci, 50 have been mapped in brown trout (Gharbi et al. 2006), along with two of the QTLs. A total of 33 linkage groups were represented. Female mapping distances between the analysed linked loci ranged between 5.6 and 49.9 centimorgans (cM) (see Hansen & Mensberg [2009] for further information). Information on all 61 analysed loci is summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information).
PCR amplification was conducted using Qiagen’s multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using an annealing temperature of 57 °C. Four loci with different terminal dyes were amplified in each multiplex. Several different combinations of loci were used in the multiplex sets, and details are available from the authors on request. The loci were analysed on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Extraction of DNA from historical samples was conducted separately from contemporary samples, PCR was set up using separate reagents, and negative controls were used consistently to check for contamination.
Genetic variation and differentiation
Genetic variation was quantified by observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity, and by allelic richness (El Mousadik & Petit 1996), the latter based on the smallest sample size (N = 24 at Ssa156NVH in STO-47). Deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were tested by permutation tests measuring if Fis was significantly higher or lower than expected by chance (i.e. significant heterozygote deficit or excess). We put particular emphasis on the tests for heterozygote deficits, as we would a priori suspect null alleles or allelic dropouts as causes of Hardy–Weinberg disequilibria. These analyses were conducted using FSTAT 2.9.1 (Goudet 1995). Genetic differentiation among populations was estimated with Weir & Cockerham’s (1984) estimator of FST with confidence intervals determined by bootstrapping 10 000 times over loci. The software MSA was used for these analyses (Dieringer & Schlotterer 2003). All tests for HWE and significance of pairwise FST were corrected for multiple tests by applying a false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini & Yekutieli 2001).
The possibility of recent bottlenecks was assessed using the simulation based test by Cornuet & Luikart (1996), assuming a two-phase model of mutation with 90% stepwise mutations, and the graphical test by Luikart et al. (1998), which detects shifts from the L-shaped allele frequency spectrum expected at equilibrium. The software Bottleneck 1.2.02 (Piry et al. 1999) was used for these analyses.
Analysis of possible selection
Outlier tests for identifying loci under possible hitchhiking selection can be categorized into tests for significantly high or low differentiation and tests for reduced variability (selective sweeps) (Storz 2005). We applied three tests procedures representing two of these categories. We used a Bayesian simulation-based test by Beaumont & Balding (2004), which has been further developed and implemented in the software Bayescan 1.0 (Foll & Gaggiotti 2008). Briefly, the method is based on population-specific FST values, which integrate population-specific and locus-specific (selection) effects. In Foll & Gaggiotti’s (2008), fully Bayesian implementation, the posterior probability of a locus being under selection is calculated by assuming two alternative models, one including selection and another excluding it. Hence, the strength of evidence favouring one model (selection) over the other (neutrality) can be evaluated by calculating the Bayes factor. The test uses population-specific FST values, which allow for asymmetries in population structure, such as deviation from classical island models. This is particularly relevant for this study, where no gene flow occurs from wild populations to hatchery strains. We based our analyses on 10 pilot runs each consisting of 5000 iterations, followed by 100 000 iterations. Repeated analyses showed that this was sufficient to achieve convergence.
Although the methods by Beaumont & Balding (2004) and Foll & Gaggiotti (2008) allow for population structure asymmetries, it has recently been demonstrated that the presence of strong hierarchical population structure may bias results and lead to increased numbers of false positives (Excoffier et al. 2009). We therefore conducted a hierarchical analysis of genetic differentiation among the groups of wild historical (STO47, SKJ47), wild contemporary (STO01, SKJ02, KON06) and hatchery (HAR, VOR) populations. We furthermore applied the test by Excoffier et al. (2009) (in the following denoted hierarchical island model test), which is based on Beaumont & Nichols (1996) method but takes a hierarchical population structure into account. Outlier loci are detected in terms of FST across all populations and in terms of FCT, differentiation among groups of populations. Confidence limits are determined by simulating a large number of loci, assuming a hierarchical island model with genetic differentiation among groups and among populations within groups corresponding to the genetic differentiation observed in the empirical data set. In cases where no hierarchical structure is present, the method is identical to that of Beaumont & Nichols (1996). We conducted tests for the full data set and for subsets of the data. We assumed a model of five groups each

consisting of 50 populations and based the tests on 100 000 simulated loci. For subsets of the data with no hierarchical structure we assumed a model of 50 populations. The software Arlequin 3.5 (Excoffier et al. 2005) was used for these analyses.
Furthermore, we used the lnRH test (Kauer et al. 2003), which specifically tests for selective sweeps; reduced variation at a locus because of positive selection for one or a few alleles. In contrast to bottlenecks, which lead to loss of variation at the genome level, selective sweeps specifically affect the genes that are under selection along with their flanking regions. The lnRH test aims to separate selective sweeps from demographic effects, such as bottlenecks, by calculating the logarithm to the ratio of H for each locus for a pair of populations. H is defined as [1⁄(1 – He)]2 – 1, where He denotes expected heterozygosity (Kauer et al. 2003). The lnRH estimates for individual loci are approximately normally distributed, and loci that are outliers in the distribution are candidates for selective sweeps.
In the case of the hierarchical island model and lnRH tests, we applied FDR correction for multiple tests (Benjamini & Yekutieli 2001), but provide both adjusted and unadjusted results. FDR corrections are not valid for the Bayesian P-values of the Bayescan analyses (Beaumont 2008), but we compensated for this by applying stringent thresholds for considering results significant.
Finally, outlier tests do not by themselves indicate if specific loci found to be under potential selection in historical wild vs. hatchery strain comparisons are also under selection in contemporary populations. We therefore analysed admixture proportions in contemporary populations using historical samples and hatchery strains as baseline samples, in order to determine if significantly lower admixture occurred at loci suggested to be under diversifying selection using outlier tests. We first estimated admixture proportions for putatively neutral loci. Next, we estimated admixture proportions individually for the loci potentially under selection and compared admixture proportions to those obtained for the putatively neutral loci. For these analyses, we used the estimator of admixture proportions by Chakraborty et al. (1992), implemented in Admix 1.0 (Bertorelle &
Excoffier 1998). Standard deviations of admixture proportions were estimated based on bootstrapping 10 000 times over loci.
Results
Genetic variation and differentiation
Genetic variation ranged from two and three alleles observed at Hsp and Ssa14DU, respectively, to 51 alleles observed at CA058586. Numbers of alleles, allelic richness, observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity for individual samples are listed in Table S2 (Supporting Information). The tests for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium assuming an alternative hypothesis of heterozygote excess yielded only six significant outcomes among 421 tests (data not shown). Conversely, assuming an alternative hypothesis of heterozygote deficits yielded a total of 47 significant outcomes (Table S2, Supporting Information). Four loci (UBA, Str11INRA, Ssa161NVH, Onel107) accounted for 18 of the significant outcomes, suggesting that null alleles were present at these loci, which was also indicated by analyses using Microchecker (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004). This problem was by far most pronounced at UBA, where estimated null allele frequencies (using the ‘Van Oosterhout’ algorithm implemented in Microchecker) ranged from 0.088 to 0.285 in different samples. Allelic dropouts because of degraded DNA may also have caused significant heterozygote deficits in the two historical samples, as 21 significant outcomes were observed in SKJ47 and STO47. However, none of the three loci suggested to be under diversifying selection (CA060208, Ssa19NVH and Ssa63NVH; see below) showed significant heterozygote deficits in the historical samples.
Genetic differentiation, FST, among all samples was 0.035 (99% CI: 0.028–0.042). Pairwise FST values ranged from 0.010 between SKJ47 and STO01 to 0.061 between STO47 and HAR (Table 1). The two hatchery strains VOR and HAR showed close genetic relationships (FST = 0.019). Differentiation was higher between historical wild samples and hatchery strains (FST between

The tests by Cornuet & Luikart (1996) and Luikart et al. (1998) provided no evidence for recent bottlenecks in any of the samples (data not shown). This was also the case after excluding CA060208, Ssa19NVH and Ssa63NVH, which may be candidates for being under selection (see below).
Bayescan outlier tests
For the Bayescan analyses we considered loci as outliers if the hypothesis of selection as opposed to neutrality was supported by log10(Bayes factors) >1.5 or log10(Bayes factors) >2. This corresponds to ‘very strong’ and ‘decisive’, respectively, on Jeffreys (1961) scale of evidence. An initial analysis involving all samples provided evidence for diversifying selection at UBA (MHC Class I) along with five other loci (see below). However, we suspected that null alleles could have affected the outcome at UBA, although underdominance could in principle also explain the heterozygote deficits. We therefore recalculated allele frequencies assuming the presence of null alleles using Microchecker (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004) and repeated the analysis using this adjusted data set. Following this UBA was not an outlier, but there was evidence for diversifying selection at five loci: log10(Bayes factors) >1.5 at Onel107 and Hsp, and log10(Bayes factors) > 2 at Ssa19NVH, Ssa63NVH and CA060208 (Fig. 2). Moreover, there were indications of balancing selection at five other loci: log10(Bayes factors) >1.5 at Ssa24NVH and Ssa52NVH,

and log10(Bayes factors) >2 at Ssa94NVH, SsOSL32 and Ssa41NVH. These loci were characterized by very high expected heterozygosity (He values from 0.836 to 0.962; Table S2, Supporting Information), except for Ssa24NVH (He from 0.762 to 0.826; Table S2, Supporting Information).
As the full set of samples represented both spatial and temporal samples as well as hatchery and wild populations, we conducted subsequent analyses aimed at detecting diversifying selection associated with specific selection regimes (Table 2). There was no evidence for loci being under diversifying selection between the two hatchery strains. Two loci, Onel8 and BS-131 were outliers in a test between the historical samples. Onel8 and CA060208 were outliers in a comparison involving all three contemporary samples. Three loci, Ssa63NVH, Ssa19NVH and Onel8 were outliers between pooled wild historical and pooled wild contemporary samples, and Ssa63NVH, Onel8, CA060208 were outliers in pooled hatchery strain samples vs. pooled historical samples. Finally, Ssa63NVH was suggested to be under diversifying selection in pooled hatchery strain trout vs. pooled wild contemporary samples.
In total, Ssa19NVH, Ssa63NVH and CA060208 were outliers in several different comparisons consistent with diversifying selection. It is more questionable if the outlier status of Hsp and Onel8 should be interpreted as diversifying selection. Both loci showed low variation, with frequencies of the most common allele (166 bp) at Hsp ranging from 0.88 to 1, and the most common allele (175 bp) at Onel8 ranging from 0.82 to 0.93 among samples. In contrast, the frequency of the most common allele at CA060208 (168 bp) ranged from 0.31 to 0.68, and at Ssa19NVH the most common allele (109 bp) showed frequencies from 0.30 to 0.63.

 For the hierarchical island model tests, outliers across all populations (FST) and between groups of populations (FCT) are listed. In subsets of samples without hierarchical structure, outliers in terms of FCT cannot be calculated and the test is identical to that by Beaumont & Nichols (1996). Loci denoted by bold are outliers that remain significant after false discovery rate correction (only applicable for the hierarchical island model and lnRH tests).

Hierarchical island model outlier tests
A hierarchical analysis showed that genetic differentiation between the groups of historical, contemporary and hatchery samples, FCT was 0.017 (P = 0.020), whereas differentiation among samples within groups, FSC was 0.019 (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, despite this hierarchical structure application of the hierarchical island model outlier test by Excoffier et al. (2009) identified the same three loci as outliers that showed log10(Bayes Factor) >2 in the Bayescan analysis: Ssa19NVH, Ssa63NVH, CA060208 and additionally the
loci Ssa408 and Ssa103NVH (Table 2; Fig. 3). However, it should be noted that only CA060208 remained significant after FDR correction. Four loci were candidates for being under balancing selection: Str15, Ssa14DU, Ssa41NVH and Ssa24NVH, the latter two of which were also outliers in the Bayescan analysis. In terms of differentiation among groups of populations, FCT, three loci were candidates for being under diversifying selection: Ssa103NVH, Ssa19NVH and CA060208 (Table 2).

historical or wild contemporary samples vs. hatchery trout (Table 2), although none of the results for Ssa19NVH remained significant after FDR correction. The patterns for Ssa63NVH were much less pronounced as compared with the Bayescan analyses. Ssa103NVH and Ssa408 were also outliers in comparisons of wild historical and contemporary vs. hatchery trout samples, but neither of these loci were outliers in the BAYESCAN tests.
lnRH outlier tests
We tested for selective sweeps by conducting lnRH tests between samples within the groups of hatchery strains, wild historical populations and wild contemporary populations. Furthermore, we pooled samples within groups and tested for selective sweeps between wild historical vs. contemporary populations, hatchery strains vs. wild historical populations and hatchery strains vs. wild contemporary populations (Table 2). In a few cases, some of the same loci were suggested to be under selection as were identified in several of the Bayescan and hierarchical island model tests (Ssa19NVH, Ssa63NVH, Ca060208). Overall, however, there were no obvious patterns in the results, particularly when considering the outcomes that remained significant after FDR correction, and limited concordance with the outcomes of the other tests.
Patterns of differentiation at outlier loci
The Bayescan and hierarchical island model tests provided relatively consistent evidence for diversifying selection at CA06020, Ssa19NVH and Ssa63NVH. In order to further assess in which populations and environments these loci could be under diversifying selection, we plotted pairwise FST for the individual loci along with pairwise FST and 99% confidence intervals for the remaining loci (Fig. 4). The results showed highly distinct patterns of differentiation at CA060208.
 The locus showed lower than average differentiation between the two hatchery strains, VOR and HAR, but highly elevated differentiation in comparisons between historical samples (SKJ47 and STO47) and hatchery strains. Similarly, elevated differentiation was observed between the contemporary wild samples KON06 and STO01 vs. the hatchery strains, but not between the strongly introgressed SKJ02 sample and the hatchery strains. Moreover, the locus showed elevated differentiation in comparisons between SKJ02 vs. the historical SKJ47 and the contemporary STO01 and KON06 samples. In total, we interpret these results as reflecting diversifying selection at CA060208 in hatchery strains vs. wild trout populations.
Differentiation at Ssa19NVH showed a qualitatively similar picture as observed for CA060208. However, this locus only showed elevated differentiation in comparisons involving HAR and not the other hatchery strain, VOR. Finally, Ssa63NVH showed elevated differentiation in comparisons involving the hatchery strain VOR and wild historical and contemporary samples. The patterns were less distinct than for CA060208 and Ssa19NVH.
Admixture proportions at outlier loci
In order to further assess if contemporary selection takes place at loci suggested to be under diversifying selection in historical wild vs. hatchery samples, we estimated admixture proportions in SKJ02 and STO01, using ADMIX 1.0. The hatchery strain HAR and the historical samples SKJ47 and STO47, respectively, were used as baseline samples. We omitted VOR from the analyses as trout from this strain had not been stocked into these two rivers.
The admixture proportion (±2.58 SD, corresponding to a 99% confidence interval) of HAR in STO01 for putatively neutral loci (all loci excluding CA06020, Ssa19NVH and Ssa63NVH) was 0.245 (0.146–0.344). However, the estimated admixture proportion at

 Ssa19NVH was 0.008 and at CA060208 0.072, suggestive of selection at these loci against alleles introduced by HAR strain trout.
In SKJ02 the admixture proportion of HAR for putatively neutral loci was 0.536 (0.435–0.638). The admixture proportion of Ssa19NVH was 0.458, implying that no selection had occurred at this locus following introgression. At CA060208 the estimated HAR admixture proportion was 0.790, thus in fact suggesting selection in the direction of alleles favoured in HAR.
Discussion
Our results are suggestive of diversifying selection at three loci, CA06020, Ssa19NVH and Ssa63NVH. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that selection acts at the genetic level against stocked hatchery strain trout. First, the three loci were primarily outliers in comparisons between wild and hatchery strain trout. Second, the patterns of differentiation were relatively consistent over time, that is, between historical wild–hatchery and contemporary wild–hatchery comparisons. Third, the analysis of admixture proportions of historical and hatchery strain trout in the contemporary STO01 sample suggested significantly lower
introgression of hatchery-derived alleles at CA06020 and Ssa19NVH as compared with putatively neutral loci. Below we discuss these points in detail.
Evidence for selection
Results of outlier tests for identifying loci under possible selection must be evaluated critically. The problems include (i) deviations from the demographic models assumed in the tests (Excoffier et al. 2009), (ii) inclusion of severely bottlenecked populations leading to high numbers of false positives (Teshima et al. 2006; Foll & Gaggiotti 2008), (iii) differences in mutation rates among loci (Beaumont 2008) and (iv) general problems of extensive multiple testing (Beaumont 2008).
Clearly, (i) the analysed populations exhibited highly asymmetric gene flow, as migration is unidirectional from hatchery strains to wild populations. The use of population-specific FST values in Bayescan should compensate for this problem (Foll & Gaggiotti 2008). However, there was also a hierarchical structure among the population samples, potentially inflating the number of detected outliers (Excoffier et al. 2009). Employing the hierarchical island model test by Excoffier et al. (2009) to the total set of samples also led to the identification

of Ssa19NVH, Ssa63NVH and CA060208 as significant outliers, thus suggesting that hierarchical structure was not a major problem. It should be noted, however, that the test assumes a geographical hierarchical structure, whereas the hierarchical structure in the present data set was both geographical and temporal, thereby complicating the interpretation of results. (ii) Tests for recent population bottlenecks provided no significant outcomes. Mean expected heterozygosity across loci was slightly lower in hatchery strains (0.693–0.720) than wild populations (ranging from 0.731 to 0.762), but not to an extent indicating strong bottlenecks (Table S2, Supporting Information). (iii) Similar to Ma ̈kinen et al. (2008), we found that several loci suggested to be under balancing selection also exhibited very high expected heterozygosity. It is possible that low FST values at these loci could be artefacts due to high mutation rates (Beaumont 2008). We did not attempt to estimate mutation rates, but this may warrant further consideration in future studies. (iv) Finally, the many tests conducted undoubtedly led to a number of false positives. For instance, if only results were considered that were significant after FDR correction, then only CA060208 would be considered a consistent outlier in the hierarchical island model tests (Table 2). However, the patterns of outlier status and differentiation at the three most pronounced candidate loci were in accordance with expectations for diversifying selection in hatchery and wild environments, and for two of the loci this was further confirmed by comparing admixture proportions at candidate loci and presumptively neutral loci.
One common solution to uncertainties with test outcomes is to apply conceptually different tests and compare the results (Vasema ̈ gi et al. 2005; Ma ̈ kinen et al. 2008). We therefore applied both tests for selective sweeps (Kauer et al. 2003) and FST-based outlier tests (Foll & Gaggiotti 2008; Excoffier et al. 2009). However, the lnRH tests yielded few consistent results and there was limited overlap with the results of the other tests. The lnRH test does not allow for detecting selective sweeps that have occurred in both populations of a tested pair (Storz 2005). This could be the case if opposite selective sweeps have occurred under hatchery and wild selection regimes. Conversely, this would lead to high differentiation at the loci under selection and likely be detected using FST-based outlier tests.
Footprints of selection between wild and hatchery strain trout
Studies of genetic interactions between domesticated and wild organisms have generally found negative fitness consequences for the wild populations (Allendorf et al. 2001; Edmands 2007). In salmonids, farmed and
wild fish have been shown to differ at a number of traits of potential ecological importance, such as growth rate, spawning time, spawning behaviour and aggressiveness (Fleming et al. 2000; McGinnity et al. 2003; Jonsson & Jonsson 2006; Hansen & Mensberg 2009). Recent studies have also documented disruption of gene expression profiles in farmed-wild crosses (Roberge et al. 2006; Normandeau et al. 2009), possibly reflecting outbreeding depression. Notably, Roberge et al. (2007) used a ‘transcriptome scan’ approach for identifying candidate loci showing adaptively different gene expression between wild and farmed fish. However, to our knowledge this study is the first to directly investigate selection at the molecular level in farmedwild salmonid fish interactions in natural environments.
The three loci most consistently showing evidence of being under diversifying selection exhibited patterns of differentiation in accordance with our initially stated expectation that diversifying selection should primarily be evident between wild populations vs. hatchery strains. CA060208 showed elevated differentiation in comparisons involving both hatchery strains, whereas the two other loci only showed strong differentiation in comparisons involving either the HAR (Ssa19NVH) or VOR (Ssa63NVH) strains. Although these results may indicate that differentiation at the loci has occurred as a result of diversifying selection, they nevertheless do not provide evidence for contemporary selection against alleles introduced by stocked trout. A locus may be an outlier showing very high FST in a comparison between wild historical and hatchery strain trout. After stocking, genetic differentiation across all loci between the wild and hatchery population decreases by a proportional factor determined by the admixture that has occurred. The locus showing significantly higher FST than other loci in the historical wild–hatchery comparison may therefore still be an outlier in a comparison of contemporary wild–hatchery strain trout, even if no contemporary selection has occurred. Such evidence, however, is provided by the estimation of admixture proportion of the HAR strain in the contemporary STO01 sample; admixture proportions were significantly lower for Ssa19NVH and CA060208 than for putatively neutral loci.
Why were no indications present of selection in the contemporary SKJ02 sample? This population is strongly introgressed by stocked HAR strain trout, and it is possible that the ‘immigration rate’ (m) of stocked HAR trout has been sufficiently high such as to overcome selection pressures (m > s). Indeed, we ascribe the outlier status of CA060208 between wild contemporary and historical samples (see Table 2 and Fig. 4) to the strong introgression of the SKJ population causing its genetic composition to shift towards that of the HAR strain. The high HAR admixture proportions at the locus CA060208

might in fact suggest positive selection for hatchery-specific alleles. Since 2003 only stocking with offspring of local populations has been allowed in Denmark. In most rivers, this is conducted exclusively by rearing and stocking offspring of wild-caught trout, but in SKJ a permanent gene bank is maintained, which is occasionally supplemented by wild-caught individuals. Hence, the possibility exists that a major proportion of the trout sampled in SKJ have experienced a hatchery rather than a wild selection regime and that inadvertent adaptation to a hatchery environment is still ongoing.
The question remains whether the suggested footprints of selection reflect maladaptation of stocked trout in wild environments due to adaptation to hatchery environments, or adaptive differences between the local wild populations and the wild populations from which the hatchery strains were originally founded. The two hatchery strains were founded more than 50 years ago (􏰠12–15 generations) from populations in Eastern Jutland (Hansen et al. 2001). Resolving this issue would therefore require analysis of the original source populations in order to assess if diversifying selection had occurred after founding of the strains. Such data are, however, not available. Yet, two factors make this scenario plausible and are commensurate with our results of adaptation to hatchery environments. First, a recent study has suggested that adaptation to hatchery environments and fitness loss in the wild can occur surprisingly fast (Araki et al. 2007) and certainly within the time span that these strains have existed. Second, studies of stocked brown trout populations in other parts of Denmark and across different environmental conditions have shown reduced performance of the hatchery strains (Hansen et al. 2001, 2009; Hansen 2002; Ruzzante et al. 2004), suggesting that general adaptation to hatchery environments and maladaptation to wild environments has occurred.
Loci involved in selection
The 61 analysed loci encompassed nine loci that were either EST-linked or QTLs in other salmonids. Only one of them, the EST-linked CA060208 was suggested to be a strong outlier, whereas Ssa63NVH and Ssa19NVH were anonymous loci. BLAST searches based on flanking region sequences did not establish homologies to known genes for any of the loci. However, even if homologies had been determined there is a long step from analysing hitch-hiking selection, as in this study, to identifying the actual functional gene under selection, which could be located further apart on the same chromosome (Vasema ̈gi & Primmer 2005; Nosil et al. 2009).
It is noteworthy that CA060208 was also found to be a strong outlier in a genome scan of wild Atlantic sal-
mon populations (Vasema ̈gi et al. 2005). In this case, the locus was an outlier in comparisons involving landlocked (freshwater) and anadromous (saltwater) populations. The hatchery strains analysed in the present study were originally founded from anadromous populations, but have since then been kept exclusively in freshwater. This raises the intriguing possibility that CA060208 is a marker of a chromosomal region associated with saltand freshwater adaptation, a hypothesis that could be tested by analysing more hatchery strains and wild landlocked freshwater populations.
Conclusions
Although several previous studies have found that salmonid fishes of farmed origin exhibit reduced performance in the wild, it has often been unclear whether this reflects strictly nongenetic effects, such as circumstances of stocking and juvenile experience in hatchery environments or genetic maladaptation (Hansen 2002). Our results provide evidence that farmed and wild salmonid fish populations may indeed exhibit footprints of diversifying selection at the molecular level, possibly reflecting adaptation to hatchery and wild environments, respectively. Moreover, evidence is presented suggestive of selection against hatchery-specific alleles after admixture between hatchery and wild trout has occurred. Finally, our study demonstrates the usefulness of analysing historical and contemporary samples, not only for comparing past and present population structure but also for analysing possible selection at the genomic level at a temporal scale (Nielsen & Hansen 2008).
