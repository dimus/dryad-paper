Past geological and climatological processes shape extant biodiversity. In the Hawaiian Islands, these processes have provided the physical environment for a number of extensive adaptive radiations. Yet, single species that occur throughout the islands provide someof the best casesfor understandinghow speciesrespondtothe shiftingdynamicsofthe islandsinthe contextof colonization historyand associateddemographicand adaptive shifts. Here, we focusonthe Hawaiianhappy-face spider,a single color-polymorphic species, anduse mitochondrialand nuclear allozyme markersto examine(1) how themosaicformationof the landscape hasdictated population structure, and(2) how cyclesof expansion and contraction of the habitat matrixhave been associatedwithdemographic shifts, includinga “quantum shift”inthegenetic basisofthe color polymorphism.Theresults show amarked structureamong populations consistentwiththeageprogressionofthe islands.The .ndingoflowgenetic diversityat theyoungest sitecoupled with the veryhighdiversityofhaplotypesonthe slightly oldersubstratesthatare highlydissectedby recent volcanism suggeststhatthe mosaic structureofthe landscape mayplayan importantrolein allowing differentiationofthe

KEY WORDS: Adaptive shifts,foundereffects, phylogeography. 

The Hawaiian archipelago was formed de novo by volcanic ac­tivity, with the islands generated in a chronological sequence as the Pacific plate moved over a “hot spot” in the earth’s crust (Fig. 1). This temporal arrangement, coupled with its isolation (3200 km from the nearest continent), and the diversity of geo­logical processes and microclimates within each island, renders the archipelago an ideal location for the study of evolution. Iso­lation has allowed the development of some of the most dramatic known examples of adaptive evolution. Although many of these are involved with species proliferation (Cowie and Holland 2008; Rundell and Price 2009), there are some cases in which pop­ulation differentiation has occurred without speciation (Givnish 1997), for example, molecular diversification of the land snail Succinea caduca within and among six of the Hawaiian Islands (Holland and Cowie 2007), and complex population structuring in the damselflies Megalagrion xanthomelas and M. pacificum (Jordan et al. 2005). These latter cases provide a unique oppor­tunity to examine the role of the dynamic landscape in fostering genetic differentiation and adaptive stasis (Carson et al. 1990). 

The biogeographic pattern that predominates in Hawaiian taxa, for both species and populations, is a step-like progression down the island chain from older to younger islands (Wagner and

Funk 1995) often with repeated bouts of diversification within islands and with limited gene flow between islands (Roderick and Gillespie 1998). However, the progression is complicated by historical connections between some of the islands. In particu­lar, the islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kahoolawe—often referred to as Greater Maui (Maui Nui)—were formed (1.2–2.2 Ma) as a single landmass and remained as such until subsidence started causing separation of the islands (0.6 Ma), with intermit­tent connection since that time during low sea stands (Price and Elliot-Fisk 2004). Likewise, the repeated episodes of extinction and recolonization resulting form active volcanism, currently ev­idenced on Hawaii Island, were presumably also operating on the older islands during their formation. 

Carson et al. (1990) highlighted the role of genetic admix­ture in the initiation of population and species differentiation. They suggested that within species, the juxtaposition of differ­ent genetic combinations would be frequent during the growth phase of each of the Hawaiian volcanoes, declining as each volcano becomes dormant, with the result that the youngest is­lands serve as evolutionary crucibles. This idea has been supported by small-scale studies in fragmented populations of flies (Carson and Johnson 1975; Carson et al. 1990) and spiders (Vandergast et al. 2004). However, because most of these examples have, over the longer history of the islands, also been associated with species proliferation, it has been impossible to tease apart the importance of such genetic effects within species from the process of spe­ciation itself. The current study focuses on a single species, the Hawaiian happy-face spider Theridion grallator Simon (Araneae: Theridiidae), in which the genetic basis for adaptation to the en­vironment differs between islands (Oxford and Gillespie 1996a) despite the ecological and phenotypic similarity of populations. As such, this species provides one of the best opportunities for examining the role of fragmentation and a shifting mosaic land­scape in shaping the genetic structure of a taxon over the entire chronology of the archipelago. 

Theridion grallator is a small spider that is largely restricted to wet and mesic forest on four of the Hawaiian Islands: Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. The similarity in genitalic charac­ters with no obvious differences across islands and the viabil­ity of offspring from crosses between individuals from different islands (Oxford and Gillespie 1996b) together imply that this is a single species. The spider exhibits a dramatic color poly­morphism for which more than 20 distinct color morphs have been described (Gillespie and Tabashnik 1989; Gillespie and Ox­ford 1998; Oxford and Gillespie 2001). Laboratory rearing ex­periments have indicated that this polymorphism is inherited in a Mendelian fashion through alleles at one (possibly two—see below) genetic locus, with the phenotypes exhibiting a domi­nance hierarchy that reflects the extent of expressed pigmentation (Oxford and Gillespie 1996a,b,c). In virtually all populations, the polymorphism comprises a common cryptic Yellow morph and numerous rarer patterned morphs, and appears to be main­tained by balancing selection (Gillespie and Oxford 1998). In­terestingly, a fundamental change occurred in the mechanism of inheritance of the color polymorphism on the island of Hawaii compared to Maui. On Hawaii, rather than being controlled by a single locus as on Maui, there is good evidence of a second locus being involved together with sex-limitation affecting sev­eral morphs (Oxford and Gillespie 1996a). In particular, the Red Front morph on Hawaii is restricted to males; females of the same genotype are Yellow (Oxford and Gillespie 1996a,b). This find­ing, together with data indicating high levels of differentiation among populations (Gillespie and Oxford 1998), suggests that the color polymorphism, or at least many of the rarer patterned morphs, may have been “reinvented” several times within the species. 

The genetically based adaptive changes that have occurred between the highly structured populations of the Hawaiian happy-face spider present a model system for examining evolutionary process within a shifting mosaic of isolation. Here, we set out to examine the effects of two processes on spider population struc­ture. First, we explore the effect of population isolation, and the extent to which this is dictated by the mosaic structure of the landscape both within and among islands. Second, we assess the extent to which cycles of expansion and contraction of the habitat matrix are associated with population expansion and contraction in T. grallator. These two processes are explored with mitochon­drial and nuclear markers, classical population genetic estimates of diversity, Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic and dating analy­ses, and coalescent-based inferences of likely migration models. The population genetic structure is examined in the context of the known genetic bases for color polymorphism in the different populations. 





Materials and Methods 

SAMPLE COLLECTION 

Theridion grallator was collected directly from the undersides of broad-leaved plants such as Broussaisia arguta (Saxifragaceae) and Clermontia arborescens (Campanulaceae). Collection loca­tion details are given in Figure 1. For numbers of individuals collected and subject to different analyses see Table 1. Through­out this article, sites are referred to by their location numbers, for example [3]. Specimens were collected in 1998 (allozyme samples) and between 2008 and 2010 (mtDNA samples, except Kamakou, Molokai [2] and Puu Kukui, West Maui [3] from al­lozyme extractions). 

The analysis was conducted at two levels. We distinguished the samples by the volcano on which they were collected. We also examined subpopulations on Waianae, Oahu (Puu Kaua [4d], and from three areas on Mt. Kaala [4a–c]), and on Haleakala, East Maui (Lower Waikamoi [4b], Upper Waikamoi [4a], Auwahi [4c]). Because populations of T. grallator are very patchily dis­tributed and often at low densities, sample sizes were limited for sites [1d, 2, 3]. 

Sequences from T. kauaiensis and T. posticatum were em­ployed as outgroups in the phylogenetic analysis as these were shown to be sister species to T. grallator (Arnedo et al. 2007). 



ALLOZYME ELECTROPHORESIS 

In a previous study (Gillespie and Oxford 1998), seven enzyme systems, yielding eight putative loci, were determined and scored in 107 specimens of T. grallator (four specimens from Kamakou, Molokai [2], 48 from Haleakala, Waikamoi, East Maui [4], 16 from Mt. Kohala, Hawaii [5], 24 from the Saddle, Hawaii [6], and 15 from Kilauea, Hawaii [7]—see Fig. 1) using cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis, as part of a test for selection

Here, we reanalyze these data, together with previously unan­alyzed data from this collection (an additional eight specimens from Puu Kukui, West Maui [3] and 11 specimens from Waianae, Oahu [Mt. Kaala Boardwalk {1a}]). Enzymes and allele frequen­cies are documented in Table S1. 



DNA ISOLATION AND SEQUENCING 

DNAwas extracted from 331 specimens of T. grallator and two fragments of the mtDNA were sequenced: a 658-bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene and a 612-bp re­gion encompassing part of the large ribosomal subunit (16SrRNA), the tRNAleuCUN gene, and 407 bp of the NADH subunit 1 (ND1) gene. (For full PCR and sequencing conditions see Supporting Information.) 



STATISTICAL ANALYSES 

DNA sequence analysis 

DNA sequence traces were edited using SEQUENCHER version 

4.6 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI) and aligned and manipulated using MESQUITE version 2.73 (Maddison and Maddison 2009) and CLUSTAL X version 2.0 (Larkin et al. 2007). All sequences were examined to ensure that they were not pseudogenes. Sum­mary statistics of genetic diversity among mtDNA haplotypes within populations were calculated using ARLEQUIN version 3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010). These included haplotype diversity . (Nei 1987) and nucleotide diversity averaged over all sites pn (Tajima 1983). 

Population structure among islands, volcanoes, and among subpopulations within volcanoes was analyzed in two ways. First, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Excoffier et al. 1992; Excoffier and Smouse 1994) was performed using ARLEQUIN version 3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010) to apportion genetic variation into within-and among-population, and among-island components. Second, pairwise genetic differentiation among pop­ulations was examined using AMOVA, as implemented by AR­LEQUIN to estimate FST and  ST—an analogue of Wright’s FST that takes the evolutionary distance between individual haplotypes into account (Excoffier et al. 1992; Excoffier and Smouse 1994). For analyzing mtDNA subpopulation differentiation within Oahu 

[1] and East Maui [4], we chose to calculate FST (based only on haplotype frequencies), rather than  ST, as new mutations were unlikely to have reached appreciable frequencies and ge­nealogical relationships among haplotypes may be more likely to reflect historical events rather than extant population fragmen­tation (Vandergast et al. 2004). For all AMOVA-based analyses, significance was determined by 10,000 replicates, randomizing individuals over populations. Pairwise estimates of FST and  ST were visualized through two-dimensional principal coordinates analysis (PCoA or multidimensional scaling) using the CMDSCALE function of R (R Development Core Team 2008). In addition, ARLEQUIN was used to estimate the “number of migrants per gen­eration,” Neme according to the classic relationship with FST of Wright (1951). The possible evolutionary relationships among the mtDNA haplotypes were reconstructed by generating phylo­genetic networks using statistical parsimony (TCS version 1.13; Clement et al. 2000). 

To identify the most likely routes of migration and colo­nization among islands and volcanoes, we followed a Bayesian framework for model choice that uses MIGRATE-N (Beerli and Felsenstein 2001; Beerli 2006) to choose among migration mod­els on the basis of their ln marginal-likelihood. To manage the large number of possible models, we employed a modified step­wise approach (see Supporting Information). 

Gene trees for the mtDNA data were constructed using BEAST version 1.6.0 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007). BEAST was used to simultaneously reconstruct gene trees and infer divergence times and mutation rates using the known ages of the Hawaiian Islands (Clague 1996, see Fig. 1) as node constraints. BEAST was also employed to examine the historical demography of each volcano population and island using Bayesian skyline plots (Drummond et al. 2005). (For full details see Supporting Information). 

Recent departures from a constant population size were ex­amined using the mtDNA data and the summary statistics Fs (Fu 1997) and Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989). Large negative values of Fs indicate population growth. Tajima’s D not only has good power to detect population growth (Ramos-Onsins and Rozas 2002) (or departures from neutrality), but offers a two-tailed test: signifi­cantly negative values of Tajima’s D indicate population expan­sion (following a population bottleneck or a selective sweep) and significantly positive values indicate population contraction or genetic subdivision (or diversifying selection) (Eytan and Hell-berg 2010). Statistical significance was assessed by comparing the observed values to the distribution of 10,000 coalescent simu­lations in ARLEQUIN version 3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010). Fi­nally, the moment estimator of time since a sudden demographic expansion t was estimated from the mtDNA mismatch distribu­tion using ARLEQUIN version 3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010), with 95% confidence intervals estimated from 10,000 bootstrap replicates. This was used to estimate t,using themutationratein­ferred by BEAST, as an additional indicator of initial colonization times. 

Allozyme analysis 



For each population, allozyme allele frequencies per locus, the mean allelic richness (A), based upon the rarefaction method of El Mousadik and Petit (1996), the observed heterozygosity (Ho), the expected heterozygosity (He) corrected for small sample size (Nei 1978), and Wright’s inbreeding coefficient (FIS) corrected for small sample size (Kirby 1975) were calculated using FSTAT ver­sion 2.9.3.2 (Goudet 1995). Tests for genotypic disequilibrium be­tween pairs of loci and tests for deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for each population and locus were performed us­ing randomization tests (10,000 realizations) as implemented by FSTAT with sequential Bonferroni-type correction (Rice 1989). 

AMOVA analyses of the allozyme data (FST-based) were calculated as for the mtDNA sequence data except that estimates were averaged across loci. Pairwise estimates of FST were also similarly visualized through PCoA. 

Bayesian clustering analyses were applied to the allozyme data using STRUCTURE version 2.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000) to detect differentiated populations without the need to define populations a priori. The admixture model (k) with uncorrelated allele fre­quencies was employed, with sampling locality as a prior (Hubisz et al. 2009). The use of this prior does not lead to a tendency to find population structure when none is present, but can im­prove the ability of the algorithm to detect structure when data are limited (Hubisz et al. 2009). Allele frequencies tended to be skewed toward low/high frequencies in each population, therefore an optimal value for ., the allele frequency prior, was inferred by running 10 replicate analyses at k = 1, yielding . = 0.6466. Ten replicate runs were then performed for k values between 1 through to 15. All runs employed a burn-in of 100,000 iterations and a sample of 100,000 iterations. STRUCTURE HARVESTER (Earl 2009) was used to summarize the ln probability of the data for each replicate at each value of k (ln Pr(X|K)). Output files for the optimum estimate of k were merged in CLUMPP (Jakobsson and Rosenberg 2007) and graphed using DISTRUCT (Rosenberg 2004). 

The most likely routes of colonization among islands and volcanoes were evaluated using MIGRATE-N-based model-choice (Beerli and Palczewski 2010), similar to the mtDNA analyses (see Supporting Information). 

BOTTLENECK (Piry et al. 1999) was employed to look for evi­dence of recent bottlenecks from the within-population allozyme allele frequency data. This test is based upon the theoretical ex­pectation that in a recently reduced population, the number of alleles is reduced more quickly than the expected heterozygosity (He). Hence, following a recent bottleneck, He should exceed the equilibrium heterozygosity (Heq), as estimated by a coalescent process from the observed number of alleles, under the assump­tion of mutation–drift equilibrium (Cornuet and Luikart 1996; Luikart and Cornuet 1998). As recommended for allozyme data and a small number of loci (Piry et al. 1999), the data were an­alyzed under the Infinite Alleles Model (IAM) and employed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to evaluate significance. To evalu­ate Heq, 100,000 coalescent simulations were run. For compar­ison, this test was also applied to the mtDNA haplotype data, ignoring evolutionary distances between haplotypes and sim­ply using the within-population haplotype frequencies as allele data.

Results 

ALLELIC AND HAPLOTYPIC VARIATION 

Of the eight allozyme loci, the number that was polymorphic per population ranged from four to eight. A total of 38 alleles were detected: 6Pgdh (four alleles), Mdh-1 (four alleles), Idh-1 (three alleles), Pgm-1 (five alleles), Pgi-1 (eight alleles), Gpdh-1 (four alleles), Gpdh-2 (two alleles), Mpi-1 (eight alleles). Allele frequencies per enzyme and population are given in Table S1. No linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci was found af­ter sequential Bonferroni-type correction. Mean values for the estimates of within-volcano population genetic variation for the allozyme data are given in Table 1. Allelic richness (A) ranged from 1.50 (Waianae [1abc], see Fig. 1) to 2.00 (Haleakala [4ab]), and observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.34 (Kilauea [7]) to 0.55 (Kamakou [2]) and 0.49 (Waianae [1abc]). Expected het­erozygosity (He, corrected for small sample size) ranged from 

0.40 (Mt. Kohala [5]) to 0.53 (Kamakou [2]). Wright’s inbreed­ing coefficient FIS ranged from –0.09 (Waianae [1abc]) to 0.31 (Kilauea [7]). Only two populations (Haleakala [4ab] and Kilauea [7]) showed significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg expec­tations and in both cases they exhibited significantly positive FIS values (i.e., deficiency of heterozygotes), however neither remained significant after Bonferroni-type correction. No indi­vidual loci showed significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg expectations after Bonferroni-type correction. 

A total of 73 mtDNA haplotypes (1270 bp of CO1 and 16S­ND1 sequences combined) (Table S2) were identified among a sample of 331 T. grallator specimens. Alignment to database se­quences indicated no stop-codons, insertions, or deletions that would indicate evidence of pseudogenes. A total of 44 substitu­tions were observed of which 38 were transitions and six were transversions. The sequences were AT rich (75.61%). Overall, 42 (57.53%) of the haplotypes were observed only once. The nine most common haplotypes (observed 10 or more times) ac­counted for 61.14% of the individuals. No haplotypes were shared among Oahu, Greater Maui, or Hawaii, and no haplotypes were shared among the volcanoes of Greater Maui, with the exception of one (MA_05) common to Kamakou [2] and Haleakala: Lower Waikamoi [4b]. Within Hawaii, only four haplotypes (HA_01, HA_02, HA_03, HA_06) of 32 were shared among populations (see Table S2). Even so, haplotype diversity was generally high within individual volcano populations, whereas nucleotide di­versity was low (Table 1). Maximal haplotype diversities were observed in Haleakala: Lower Waikamoi [4b] . = 0.90 (pn = 0.009), and on Mt. Kohala [5], . = 0.90 (pn = 0.006). The low­est haplotype diversity was on the youngest volcano, Kilauea [7] where only five haplotypes were observed in 55 individuals (. = 0.24; pn = 0.001), with one (HA_01) accounting for 48 (87.27%) of the individuals. 



POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE 

Table 2 shows the results of AMOVA analyses of population structure, pairwise estimates of FST and  ST and corresponding estimates of Neme. For the mtDNA data, AMOVA analyses using 

 ST among islands and among volcano populations (Table 2A) revealed extremely strong structuring with 61.37% of mtDNA variation occurring among islands, 14.20% of variation occurring among populations within islands, and 24.44% occurring within populations. When the analysis was performed using only hap­lotype frequencies (traditional FST-based approach—excluding the among island category as no haplotypes were shared among islands), significant structure was still evident with 28.82% of the variation occurring among populations and 72.74% occurring within populations (Table 2A). The relative differences in the pro­portions of variation between the  ST and FST estimates (within populations:  ST = 24.44%, FST = 72.74%;  ST among all pop­ulations: [among islands + among population within islands] = 75.57%, FST = 28.82%) result from the evolutionary distance information used in the calculation of  ST and the lack of shared haplotypes among islands. Overall  ST (0.76) and FST (0.29) esti­mates were highly significant (P < 0.00001). Pairwise estimates of  ST were also generally very high, with all values (exclud­ing comparisons among the populations within Hawaii and with the exception of Haleakala [4]–Molokai [2] [ ST = 0.37]) ex­ceeding 0.55. Pairwise values of  ST among the populations on Hawaii were lower, notably that between the Saddle [6] and Mt. Kohala [5] ( ST = 0.09, P = 0.0071). With the exception of the latter, P-values for all comparisons were less than 0.001. Corre­spondingly, estimates of Neme were also extremely low, with all values <1 with the exception of Saddle [6] and Mt. Kohala [5] (Neme = 5.26), suggesting very little movement between volcano populations. 

AMOVA analyses of the allozyme data (Table 2B) revealed a similar picture to that of the FST-based mtDNA AMOVA, with 20.60% of variation occurring among islands, 12.65% occurring among populations within islands (i.e., 33.25% among all popu­lations), and 66.75% occurring within populations. Overall FST was highly significant (FST = 0.33, P < 0.00001). Pairwise es­timates of FST were also high with most comparisons yielding values greater than 0.40 and P-values less than 0.001. Again, estimates among the populations on Hawaii were much lower, notably between Mt. Kohala [5] and Kilauea [7] (FST = 0.04, P = 0.0428) and between the Saddle [6] and Kilauea [7] (FST = 0.03, P = 0.0311). Pairwise estimates of FST between Haleakala [4ab] and all other volcano populations were intermediate (range 0.14–0.34) with corresponding estimates of Neme > 1(with the ex­ception of Haleakala [4ab]–Mt. Kohala [5], Neme = 0.97), which might suggest an intermediary role for Haleakala (East Maui) in the colonization of other islands. In general, though, estimates of Neme were less than one.

Relationships among the volcano populations, based upon the matrices of FST (allozymes) and ST values (mtDNA), are graphically summarized using two-dimensional PCoA plots in Figure 2A and Figure 2B, respectively. The genetic relationships among the populations broadly reflect the geographical arrange­ment of the Hawaiian Islands. The allozyme data however suggest that Puu Kukui [3] is genetically distinct from the rest of Greater Maui (Haleakala [4ab] and Kamakou [2]—although note the small sample size (n = 8) for Puu Kukui [3]). 

AMOVA analyses, based upon mtDNA, among the subpop­ulations on Haleakala [4abc] and among the Waianae [1abcd] subpopulations yielded surprisingly similar results to the among-volcano population analyses with 26.88% of variation on Haleakala [4abc] (Table 2C), and 20.32% of Waianae [1abcd] variation (Table 2D) occurring among populations. Pairwise esti­mates of FST among the Haleakala [4abcd] subpopulations were all highly significant (P < 0.001), although there was some evi­dence of more recent genetic exchange between Lower Wakamoi [4b] and Upper Waikamoi [4a], with an FST of only 0.09 and a corresponding estimate of Neme = 4.83; this may not be sur­prising given the short distance (~4 km) and the continuous for­est between these sites. Pairwise estimates of FST among the

Waianae [1abcd] subpopulations, indicated that Puu Kaua [1d] was quite distinct from the other subpopulations [1abc] (FST = 0.4528–0.8724). Although the Mt. Kaala Boardwalk [1a] and Sub­station [1c] subpopulations were not significantly differentiated (FST = 0.02, P = 0.1977), these subpopulations were significantly differentiated from the Camp [1b] subpopulation (FST = 0.14, P = 0.0259 and FST = 0.16, P = 0.0124, respectively). Each Mt. Kaala subpopulation [1abc] was <1 km apart (Fig. 1). 

Plots of the ln probability of the data (ln Pr(X|K)) for each replicate at each value of k in the STRUCTURE analyses of the al­lozyme data clearly indicated a peak in ln Pr(X|K)at k = 5. This value was therefore chosen as the best estimate for the number of genetic subpopulations among the volcano populations. The results of the STRUCTURE analysis at k = 5, averaged over 10 replicate runs, are given in Figure 3. These results concur with the ordination in Figure 2A, illustrating the genetic similarity between Haleakala [4abc] and Kamakou [2]. These in turn show some affinity with the Waianae populations [1abc]. Puu Kukui [3] is genetically distinct from the other Greater Maui populations. Overall, the Hawaii populations are genetically distinct from the Greater Maui and Oahu populations. The Mt. Kohala [5] popula­tion is quite distinct from that on the Saddle [6] whereas the Ki­lauea [7] population appears to be intermediate between the two. 





MITOCHONDRIAL HAPLOTYPE RELATIONSHIPS 

Figure 4 shows mtDNA haplotype networks for Oahu (Fig. 4A), Greater Maui (Fig. 4B), and Hawaii (Fig. 4C). Networks were con­structed separately for each island system for clarity and because no haplotypes were shared among islands. The outgroup taxa, T. positicatum and T. kauaiensis were included in the Oahu network as they were most similar to the Oahu T. grallator haplotypes. The outgroups connect with the Puu Kaua [1d] haplotype (OA_11), suggesting that this haplotype may be more ancestral than the other Waianae haplotypes. Overall, the Waianae: Mt Kaala [1abc] haploypes show little structuring, as expected given that they rep­resent subsites within a single locality. Within Greater Maui (Fig. 4B), most haplotypes came from Haleakala: Waikamoi [4ab], and with the exception of the distinct Kamakou [2] and Puu Kukui [3] haplotypes, again show little obvious structure. The single haplo­type from Auwahi [4c] (MA_01, labeled “A” in Fig. 4B) is most similar to the common Waikamoi [4ab] haplotype MA_06 from the same volcano (Haleakala). In Hawaii (Fig. 4C), numerous haplotypes from the Saddle [6] and Mt. Kohala [5] are scattered throughout the network. The Kilauea [7] haplotypes were more clustered, perhaps reflecting a recent origin from few founding haplotypes. 



COLONIZATION AND MIGRATION MODELS 

MIGRATE-N was employed to determine the most probable models of colonization among the seven T. grallator volcano populations. Previous phylogenetic analyses (Arnedo et al. 2007) and the struc­ture, network, and phylogeographic analyses presented here (see below) all indicate that Oahu was the most likely source of all extant T. grallator populations and that colonization most likely occurred from Oahu to Greater Maui to Hawaii. Furthermore, the extremely high estimates of FST and ST, and correspondingly low estimates of Neme, among islands (Table 2) suggest that very little exchange has occurred among islands. The MIGRATE-N anal­yses strongly supported this pattern and the most likely full mi­gration model (allowing both unidirectional and back-migration), together with MIGRATE-N-based Neme estimates, is illustrated in Figure 5. (The top five models for the mtDNA and allozyme data, together with their corresponding LBFs are illustrated in Fig. S1.) Both the mtDNA data and the allozyme data yielded similar models (Figs. 5 and S1). The only differences were that the best allozyme model did not support migration from Puu Kukui [3] to Kamakou [2], or from Kilauea [7] to the Saddle [6] (as indicated by the best mtDNA model), and the mtDNA data did not support migration from the Saddle [6] to Mt. Kohala [5], or from the Sad­dle [6] to Kilauea [7] (as indicated by the best allozyme model). Estimates of Neme, computed for the combined mtDNA and al­lozyme model (Fig. 5) using MIGRATE-N, were low, as expected from the AMOVA-based estimates. Estimates of Neme between Oahu and Greater Maui and between Greater Maui and Hawaii were particularly low.

The split between Greater Maui and Hawaii was placed at 0.56 (0.37–0.75 Ma), an interval that overlaps extensively with the split between Oahu and Greater Maui (and slightly exceeds the oldest current age estimate for Hawaii of 0.43 Ma)—suggesting that the colonization of Greater Maui and Hawaii happened within a similar time-period. 



DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES 

Summary statistics that aim to detect recent population changes are given in Table 3. For the allozyme data, BOTTLENECK revealed an excess of loci showing greater than expected levels of het­erozygosity (He > Heq) under IAM in six of the seven popula­tions analyzed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank tests achieved statis­tical significance for two of the populations: Kamakou [2] (P = 0.047) and the Saddle [6] (P = 0.037). The Waianae [1abc] pop­ulation also came close to significance (P = 0.063). When the P-values for the independent populations were combined using Fisher’s method (Fisher 1932), the overall test was significant (.2 = 26.09; df = 12, P = 0.0104), suggesting that some, if not most, of the populations have undergone a recent decline in effec­tive population size. The mtDNA data suggested a different story. BOTTLENECK analyses, treating the mitochondrial haplotype as al­leles, suggested that six of the seven volcano populations showed a deficit of heterozygosity (He < Heq) under IAM. Significance testing (the probability of the observed difference in heterozygos­ity divided by the SD, tested against the neutral model because there was only one locus) indicated that this deficit was signifi­cant for Waianae [1] (P = 0.044), the Saddle [6] (P = 0.005), and Kilauea [7] (P = 0.030). Fisher’s combined P-value was highly significant (.2 = 31.37; df = 12, P = 0.0017). The Kilauea [7] population also showed a significantly negative value of Tajima’s D (Tajima’s D = –1.77, P = 0.019). Although six of the seven volcano populations also exhibited negative values of Tajima’s D, none of these achieved significance. Fisher’s combined P-value was however significant (.2 = 23.30; df = 12, P = 0.0253). Three of the seven volcano populations exhibited negative values of Fu’s Fs, however none of these approached significance and the Fisher’s combined P-value was not significant (.2 = 8. 63; df = 12, P = 0.7346). These demographic summary statistics from the allozyme and mtDNA data therefore appear to con­tradict each other, with the allozyme data generally suggesting recent population declines and the mtDNA data suggesting recent demographic expansions. The implications of this are discussed below. 

Estimates of time since a “sudden demographic expan­sion” (suggestive of initial colonization times), inferred from the mtDNA mismatch distribution, are also given in Table 3 (both as t and time, t, inferred as t = t/2µ, using the muta­tion rate µ = 3.546 × 10-8 substitutions/site/year as inferred by BEAST). The confidence intervals were broad and overlapping, especially for the smaller samples. Nonetheless, these estimates supported the logical progression of colonization in Hawaii from Mt. Kohala [5] (t = 0.12 [0.045–0.175] mya) to the Saddle [6] (t = 0.080 [0.008–0.192] mya) and then to the youngest vol­cano Kilauea [7] (t = 0.033 [0.004–0.039] mya).

supported. The colonization of Oahu appeared younger but with very broad confidence intervals (t = 0.071 [0.003–1.027] mya), probably reflecting the low haplotype diversity recorded from Waianae [1]. 

Bayesian coalescent skyline plots of the mtDNA data for Oahu, Greater Maui, and Hawaii are shown in Figure 7 (A–C). A complete set of plots for all populations is given in Figure S3. The plots for individual populations within Greater Maui and Hawaii were qualitatively very similar to the combined plots, perhaps because the mtDNA haplotypes within the major island systems (Oahu, Greater Maui, and Hawaii) tend to coalesce prior to the subpopulations on each island. No skyline plot showed statisti­cally significant changes in effective population size. However, some interesting trends can be observed. First, in all populations a notable decline in effective population size occurs around 10 Ka. In Greater Maui and Hawaii, this population decline is followed by a recent apparent increase in population size. The Hawaii plot (Fig. 7C) also shows a marked increase in population size begin­ning around 100 Ka. The same trend, albeit much weaker, is also evident in Greater Maui (Fig. 7B—note lower 95% CI) and to some extent in Oahu (Fig. 7A).

major island groups, suggesting extremely little current exchange of individuals among islands. The order of colonization fits the “progression rule” (Funk and Wagner 1995), with younger islands being colonized sequentially from older islands. This order of events was confirmed through Bayesian migration model choice using both the mtDNA and allozyme data and also indicated by the estimates of initial colonization time inferred from the mtDNA mismatch distributions. 

The relaxed molecular clock estimates suggest that T. gralla­tor diverged from its ancestors approximately 4.22 Ma (0.95–8.25 Ma) (Fig. 6). Although our chronology suggests an older date for the colonization of Greater Maui from Oahu (0.78 Ma) than for the colonization of Hawaii from Greater Maui (0.56 Ma), the confidence intervals for these estimates overlap. These dates sug­gest that the colonization of Greater Maui and subsequently of Hawaii, from Oahu, occurred rapidly and recently relative to the age of the islands. Rapid colonization of Greater Maui would not be unexpected because Greater Maui would still have com­prised a single landmass at the time of colonization. Naturally, the estimates of divergence times are subject to the assumptions of using island ages as calibration points and are entirely based upon mtDNA. Although more (nuclear) loci would lead to greater precision in both the phylogeny and dating, this would not allevi­ate the errors introduced by assumed island ages and the lack of a calibration point external to the phylogeny. However, the rela­tive timing of these events is likely to be consistent and the order of events agrees with that inferred from both the model choice analyses of the allozyme data and the mtDNA mismatch distri­butions. Indeed, the degree of agreement between the mtDNA and allozyme data in both colonization routes and migration esti­mates (AMOVA) is quite remarkable and strongly indicates that colonization of the different Hawaiian Islands by T. grallator has occurred through very rare and possibly extreme founder events. 

Similar patterns of extreme structuring of populations within species that occur across multiple islands of the Hawaiian chain have been found in several other groups, including the spider Tetragnatha quasimodo (Roderick and Gillespie 1998). The ele­paio flycatcher shows a comparable pattern with phylogenetic analyses indicating reciprocally monophyletic groups for each island on which it occurs (Vanderwerf et al. 2010).Likewise, Drosophila grimshawi (Piano et al. 1997) and two species of dam­selfly, Megalagrion xanthomelas and M. pacificum, are all highly structured between major island groups (Jordan et al. 2005), al­though show considerably more mixing of populations within islands (including Maui Nui). The land snail Succinea caduca also has populations that are structured across the islands, but evidence indicates somewhat more gene flow linking populations both within, and to some extent between, islands (Holland and 

P. J. P. CROUCHER ET AL. 

Cowie 2007). That populations within species in the Hawaiian Islands show a similar progression rule as is found at the species level suggests that niche pre-emption by already present members applies to populations as well as to species. 



HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHY AMONG VOLCANOES WITHIN ISLANDS 

Among volcano populations, with the exception of some compar­isons among those on Hawaii, all estimates of FST or ST were large and highly significant, with correspondingly small estimates for the “number of migrants per generation,” Neme. Similarly, es­timates of Neme from MIGRATE-N were also low. Although the as­sumptions of migration-drift equilibrium required for meaningful estimation of Neme are almost certainly violated in these analyses, the exact values are not important. The estimates strongly suggest that there is negligible gene flow among islands and little among volcano populations within islands. Even among subpopulations on the same volcano (Fig. 1; some < 1 km apart), gene flow is limited. BOTTLENECK analyses of the allozyme data suggest that most populations have undergone a recent decline in effective population size. The same test, treating mtDNA haplotypes as alleles, together with Tajima’s D suggests that many populations may have recently increased in size—in particular the Waianae [1], Saddle [6], and Kilauea [7] populations. For the latter two populations, this might reflect population growth following forest recovery from recent volcanic activity. The apparent discrepan­cies between the two types of data warrant further discussion. The deficit of heterozygotes against coalescent equilibrium expecta­tions (He > Heq) revealed by the allozyme analyses reflects the slightly positive FIS values also observed in these data (significant prior to Bonferroni correction for Kilauea [7] and Haleakala [4]; Table 1). Rare colonization events and associated strong founder effects lead to the rapid loss of allelic diversity and an excess of ex­pected heterozygosity. For T. grallator, this process is supported not only by between-island monophyly but also by the obser­vation that within-population haplotype diversity was generally high, whereas nucleotide diversity was low (Table 1). This implies that independent founder effects result in unique populations that generally remain isolated long enough to accrue substitutions through mutation and drift (Holland and Cowie 2007). Successful founder events are followed by demographic expansion leading to a corresponding reduction of expected heterozygosity com­pared to neutral expectations. The smaller effective population size and higher mutation rate of the mtDNA data imply that it may track recent demographic changes more efficiently (but see below): with the mtDNA summary statistics tracking the post-founder effect population growth. That both the largest positive FIS (Table 1) and the most significantly negative Tajima’s D (Ta­ble 3) were both recorded for the youngest population, Kilauea [7] (t = 0.033 [0.004–0.039] mya) is indicative of this process. How­ever, T. grallator populations have also been shaped by current (on Hawaii) and historical volcanic activity, year-to-year fluctua­tions in precipitation, and long-term climatic changes (see below). Consequently, demographic oscillations, in conjunction with the differing effective population sizes and mutation rates of the nu­clear and mtDNA markers, means that drift is likely to obfuscate these signals and decouple them so that neutral expectations are not met and demographic inferences from each type of marker are likely to disagree. Very similar patterns and processes have been described in the Hawaiian land snail S. caduca (Holland and Cowie 2007). However, it should be noted that the discrepancy between the allozyme and mtDNA data could also be the result of natural selection. Both allozymes (e.g., Nevo et al. 1986) and mtDNA (see Meiklejohn et al. 2007) may be subject to selection. For mtDNA, it has been suggested that frequent selective sweeps in larger populations may counteract the expected increase in ge­netic diversity, rendering mtDNA a poor indicator of population size (Meiklejohn et al. 2007). 

Longer term demographic changes were assessed using Bayesian coalescent skyline plots. Although none of these showed “significant” changes in effective population size over time, they indicated a sudden drop in effective population size within the last 10,000 years. Although it is possible that these results are simply an artifact due to limited sampling of coalescent time points in recent history, the replicated appearance in plots for all three island systems, and in the plots for individual populations (Fig. S3), suggests that this is not likely. The observed drop in effective population size could be the result of several factors. First, and most interestingly, the decline coincides with a period of Holocene aridification in which C3 plants were replaced by C4 plants in the islands (Uchikawa et al. 2010). During cooler periods in the past, montane forest in Hawaii experienced drier conditions, whereas during warmer periods, montane forests were wetter, as evidenced by the high number of xerophytic plants at the end of the last glacial period 10,000 years ago and increasing hydrophytes during the temperature maximum 4000–6000 years bp (Nullett et al. 1998). In addition, the Hawaii plot (Fig. 7C) shows a marked increase in population size beginning around 100 Ka years, perhaps associated with the decreasing volcanic activity on the island, with associated increase in available habitat through vegetational succession. However, this time also agrees with the possible colonization time for Hawaii as indicated by mismatch distributions (t = 0.086 [0.022–0.172] mya), and may simply re­flect expansion of the new population. Interestingly, this pattern matches that of other forest-dwelling spiders in Hawaii, in par­ticular Tetragnatha anuenue and T. brevignatha. In both species, recent and rapid population expansion was found and suggested to reflect past fragmentation caused by lava flows followed by pop­ulation expansion as individuals recolonized areas where forests had regenerated (Vandergast et al. 2004). 



PATTERNS OF COLOR POLYMORPHISM INHERITANCE 

Oxford and Gillespie (1996a,b) demonstrated that the mode of inheritance of the color polymorphism in T. grallator was mod­ified subsequent to colonization of the youngest island, Hawaii. The changes are complex, involving a single locus (or linkage group) on Maui but two on Hawaii and two pairs of morphs that are sex-limited on Hawaii (Red Front males/Yellow females, and Red Ring males/Red Blob females) but not on Maui. The genetics of the polymorphism among the different Maui Nui populations seems to be identical (Oxford and Gillespie 1996c) while the situation on Oahu has yet to be explored in detail. 

Results from the phylogenetic analyses and migration mod­els using both mtDNA and allozyme data strongly suggest colo­nization from older to younger islands down the Hawaiian chain and also indicate powerful founder effects reducing variation on newly colonized islands. These analyses support previous conclu­sions based upon allozymes alone (Gillespie and Oxford 1998) that the Hawaii population was established from Maui, and that current migration between islands is extremely limited. Both the Bayesian phylogenetic and the MIGRATE-N analyses indicated that Mt. Kohala [5] might represent the area where T. grallator first colonized Hawaii, with subsequent spread to Kilauea [7] and the Saddle [6]. In the populations of Kilauea [7] (and perhaps also Mt. Kohala [5]), Yellow and Red Front morphs appear to be en­tirely sex-limited suggesting that this “quantum shift” (Oxford and Gillespie 1996a) in the genetic control of the polymorphism may have originated soon after arrival in Hawaii, probably in the small founder population. The Red Ring and Red Blob sex-limited morphs identified in the Kilauea [7] population are generally rare and their genetics elsewhere on Hawaii has not been established. The congruent signals emerging from these analyses support the argument outlined above, that rare founder events established T. grallator populations on successively newer islands with, in one case at least, major upheaval in the genetic architecture of an adaptive trait. 

Within the Saddle [6] area, two mechanisms of inheritance for the Yellow and Red Front morphs are present in the same populations (Oxford and Gillespie 1996a). The typical Hawaii pattern of sex-limited morphs predominates but the presence of some Red Front females suggests that a genetic “reversal” of the sex-limitation has occurred in this area. To date, no Yellow males have been identified. That such a reversal may have occurred in the Saddle [6] region rather than elsewhere may not be surprising given the geological activity and shifting-mosaic of fragmented habitat patches (kipuka) in this area, leading to repeated founder effects (Carson et al. 1990), a scenario supported by the genetic data, as described above. 

The demonstration of a lack of contemporary gene flow among islands, and the colonization of islands through appar­ently strong founder events, raises an interesting question regard­ing the nature of the color polymorphism. As mentioned earlier, this comprises a common Yellow morph and a plethora of “pat­terned” morphs (Oxford and Gillespie 2001) on all islands. Most of the “patterned” morphs are very rare and yet many are found across different islands and populations. Although it is unknown what the diversity of alleles underlying the color morphs would have been at founding, our results suggest that genetic diversity for color may have been reestablished on each island subsequent to the founding event (Oxford and Gillespie 2001). Recent mod­eling has shown that selection by predators such as leaf-gleaning birds can lead to many different color morphs (Franks and Oxford 2009). Such selection might explain the resurgence of visible ge­netic diversity in newly established populations that might lack the full complement of color morphs. The reappearance of identi­cal morphs likely results from constraints in pattern development (Oxford 2009). Thus, it appears that the present genetic struc­ture of T. grallator populations in Hawaii is best explained by a combination of strong between-island founder events and limited within-island gene flow, leading to stochastic modification of the gene pool, and subsequent selection on the likely depauperate visible variation to recover high levels of genetic polymorphism. 

In conclusion, we have focused on the historical biogeog­raphy of a single species found on four islands in the Hawaiian archipelago. We have demonstrated a step-like progression down the island chain similar to that shown by suites of closely re­lated species in other lineages (Funk and Wagner 1995), as well as a high level of isolation between populations both between and within volcanoes. Island colonization for T. grallator seems to have been a very infrequent event involving few individuals, which fits well with the known quantum shift in genetics under­lying the color polymorphism when Hawaii was colonized from Greater Maui (Oxford and Gillespie 1996a). The complexity of population relationships and demographic changes within the dy­namic landscape of the youngest island of Hawaii suggests that repeated fragmentation and environmental shifts driven by vol­canism and climate change, may have facilitated genetic reshuf­fling, an argument initially developed by Carson et al. (1990). This study highlights the effects of chance and contingency in evolution, and the interaction of intermittent drift and balancing selection. Drift, presumably “facilitated” the quantum leap in the genetics between Maui and Hawaii, and selection for color vari­ation then built on this to generate the observed (parallel) genetic diversity.
