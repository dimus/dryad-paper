Abstract
Recently, 454 sequencing has emerged as a popular method for isolating microsatellites owing to cost-effectiveness and
time saving. In this study, repeat-enriched libraries from two southern African endemic sparids (Pachymetopon blochii and
Lithognathus lithognathus) were 454 GS-FLX sequenced. From these, 7370 sequences containing repeats (SCRs) were identified. A brief survey of 23 studies showed a significant difference between the number of SCRs when enrichment was performed first before 454 sequencing. We designed primers for 302 unique fragments containing more than five repeat units
and suitable flanking regions. A fraction (<11%) of these loci were characterized with 18 polymorphic microsatellite loci
(nine in each of the focal species) being described. Sanger sequencing of alleles confirmed that size variation was because
of differences in the number of tandem repeats. However, a case of homoplasy and sequencing errors in the 454 sequencing
were identified. These newly developed and four previously isolated loci were successfully used to identify polymorphic
markers in nine other economically important species, representative of sparid diversity. The combination of newly developed markers with data from previous sparid cross-species studies showed a significant negative correlation between
genetic divergence to focal species and microsatellite transferability. The high level of transferability we described (48%
amplification success and 32% polymorphism) suggests that the 302 microsatellite loci identified represent an excellent
resource for future studies on sparids. Microsatellite marker development should commonly include tests of transferability
to reduce costs and increase feasibility of population genetics studies in nonmodel organisms.

Introduction
Microsatellite markers are neutral, highly variable,
codominant loci that are found in all eukaryotic genomes
(Ellegren 2004). They have been extensively used as they
are relatively easy to develop in nonmodel organisms and
provide insight into current demography of the species
studied, which has broad applications in evolutionary,
population and conservation genetics (Ellegren 2004;
Selkoe & Toonen 2006; Waples & Gaggiotti 2006).
Microsatellite loci are generally identified de novo
through time-consuming and relatively expensive methods in nonmodel organisms. There are numerous development processes, including creating selective
hybridization partial genomic libraries enriched for
repeat fragments (Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences
Containing repeats (SCRs), FIASCO, Zane et al. 2002),

mining expressed sequence tags (ESTs, Ellis & Burke
2007) and primer extension protocols (Ostrander et al.
1992; Paetkau 1999). With the advent of next-generation
sequencing, the time of cloning and Sanger sequencing
partial genomic libraries may be saved. Compared with
conventional de novo methods, it is an improved method
for identifying repeat-containing fragments in species
with low microsatellite density such as birds (Csencsics
et al. 2010), bats (McCulloch & Stevens 2011) or inbred
species (Buehler et al. 2011).
Recent studies have used 454 LifeSciences ⁄ Roche
GS-FLX sequencing either for partial genome sequencing
to identify SCRs (Abdelkrim et al. 2009; Allentoft et al.
2009; Castoe et al. 2010), or to first enrich for repeat-containing sequences before 454 sequencing (Santana et al.
2009; Malausa et al. 2011; Muths & Bourjea 2011) when
isolating microsatellites. This high-throughput sequencing procedure leads to the recovery of thousands of
repeat-containing sequences and dramatically reduces
the costs per sequence (Malausa et al. 2011). It also allows

for more stringent choices of repeat sequence for marker
development and ultimately more effective genotyping
(Guichoux et al. 2011).
An alternative to de novo microsatellite isolation is
cross-species amplification, that is, testing microsatellites
isolated from a focal species in closely related species.
This is possible owing to the potential conservation of the
flanking regions and thus the priming sites (FitzSimmons
et al. 1995). Cross-species transfer of microsatellite loci
has been successful in many species, including animals
(vertebrates and invertebrates), fungi and plants (Barbará
et al. 2007). Microsatellites identified in cetaceans, turtles
and marine fish have shown extensive flanking region
conservation in some of the markers (Schlötterer et al.
1991; FitzSimmons et al. 1995; Rico et al. 1996). For
instance, one locus has been amplified in a number of different fish families, suggesting that it has been conserved
over 470 Myr of evolution (Rico et al. 1996).
Other studies have identified clear negative correlations between genetic distance and transferability of loci
(amplification success and polymorphism) in several taxa
of vertebrates, including birds, amphibians and fish
(Primmer et al. 2005; Carreras-Carbonell et al. 2008;
Hendrix et al. 2010). Carreras-Carbonell et al. (2008) used
previous microsatellite data from cross-species studies of
fish and investigated a relationship between marker
transferability in targeted species and the genetic divergence to focal species based on the 16S or 12S mitochondrial rRNA genes. They showed that among members of
several fish families (63 species; nine families) microsatellite transferability depended on genetic divergence
between species. The equation obtained, defining this
regression model, may be used to predict the degree to
which the microsatellites from a focal fish species will be
polymorphic in a species of interest (Carreras-Carbonell
et al. 2008). Many fish studies have reported markers that
amplify in other closely related species, also in the Sparidae where a number of cross-species amplification studies have been conducted (Chen et al. 2005; Piñera et al.
2006, 2007; Liu et al. 2007; Roques et al. 2007a).
The Sparidae is one of the most economically important marine fish families of temperate regions globally,
with 115 described species (Chiba et al. 2009) of which 41
(36%) are commonly found around the southern African
coast (Heemstra & Heemstra 2004). Although sparids are
a prominent feature to the South African fishery, microsatellite markers have only been developed for one species, the roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (Teske et al. 2009).
The aim of our study was to develop a set of de novo
microsatellite markers using a combination of FIASCO
enrichment (Zane et al. 2002) and 454 GS-FLX sequencing
for two focal sparid species, the hottentot seabream (HS)
Pachymetopon blochii and the white steenbras (WS) Lithognathus lithognathus, but with applicability for a number

of other sparids. From the SCRs, we implemented stringent selection criteria when choosing loci for further
characterization with only a fraction being tested for
polymorphism. The polymorphic markers isolated were
tested with four previously isolated microsatellites from
other studies, (Piñera et al. 2006; Teske et al. 2009), across
nine additional species. First, they were tested on the two
focal species (HS and WS) to improve the number of
polymorphic markers. Second, these loci were tested on
nine additional sparids of research and economic importance to South African fisheries which also showed a
spread across the sparid phylogeny (Chiba et al. 2009).
This provided a good indication of the cross-species utility of the newly developed markers across a wide range
of sparids. Finally, genetic divergences based on 16S
were recovered for all targeted and focal taxa as well as
those from previous cross-species studies to identify
trends in the transferability of these microsatellites across
the Sparidae.

Materials and methods
Sampling and DNA extraction
For characterization of the de novo developed microsatellite markers, a sample of 50 individuals of HS were
extracted with the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen):
These included samples from Sewejaarskop se mond and
Danger Point (Table S1, Supporting information). Fifty
WS individuals from three locations (Knysna, Woody
Cape and Sundays Estuary; Table S1, Supporting information) were extracted with the Wizard Genomic DNA
Purification Kit (Promega). For cross-species amplification tests, samples from various locations for nine additional sparid species were used (Table S1, Supporting
information). Species occurring around South Africa
were chosen to represent correctly the diversity of the
Sparidae according to their position in the recent comprehensive phylogeny (Chiba et al. 2009): The chosen species
were scattered among the two major clades (A and B)
and represented seven of the 11 subclades. Sixteen individuals each of Acanthopagrus berda, Cheimerius nufar,
Chrysoblephus laticeps, Chrysoblephus puniceus, Diplodus
cervinus hottentotus, Diplodus sargus capensis, Polysteganus
undulosus, Rhabdosargus globiceps and Rhabdosargus holubi
were extracted using the Qiagen kit.

Preparation of repeat-enriched fractions and 454
sequencing for focal species
A repeat-enriched genomic fraction was generated for
both the HS and WS using the FIASCO protocol developed by Zane et al. (2002). In each species, a simultaneous
digestion ⁄ ligation reaction was performed with 250 ng of

742 K . R E I D , T . B . H O A R E A U a n d P . B L O O M E R
genomic DNA using the MseI restriction enzyme (New
England Biolabs) and MseI AFLP adaptors (5¢-TACT
CAGGACTCAT-3¢ ⁄ 5¢-GACGATGAGGTCCTGAG-3¢; Zane
et al. 2002). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was prepared with primers specific to the MseI adaptors (MseI-N;
5¢-GATGAGTCCTGAGTAAN-3¢) as described by Zane
et al. (2002). A biotinylated probe combination containing
tetranucleotide repeats of CAAA6, GAAA6 and GATA6
was hybridized with the amplified DNA fragments to
enrich for repeat motifs in each species as these are some
of the most common tetranucleotide repeats found in vertebrates (Tóth et al. 2000). The repeat-containing DNA
was then captured with streptavidin-coated beads
(Roche).
Five nonstringent washes were performed by washing
the DNA-probe-bead complex with TEN1000 (10 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, pH 7.5). This was followed
by five stringent washes (0.2· SSC, 0.1% SDS) and heat
(TE and 95 C) and chemical (0.15 M NaOH) denaturation to separate the DNA fragments containing repeats
from the streptavidin-coated beads and probes. The
enriched DNA was precipitated and PCRs were carried
out as described by Zane et al. (2002) to amplify approximately 2 lg of DNA. The enriched DNA was purified
using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit
(Roche).
The repeat-enriched DNA was sequenced using a 454
LifeSciences ⁄ Roche Genome Sequencer FLXTM with
GS-FLX titanium reagents (Inqaba Biotechnical Industries,
Pretoria, South Africa). Each of these species had approximately one-fifth of a single pyrosequencing lane of a 1 ⁄ 16
plate allocated and each probing for each species’
sequences were individually labelled through a molecular
multiplex identifier (MID) so that the sequences could later
be separated. The 454 sequencing was carried out with
standard library preparation methods except for the nebulization with nitrogen, which was omitted as the DNA had
already been fragmented using the MseI enzyme. The
DNA fragments were labelled with the specific MID adaptors before the GS adaptors (A & B) were attached. These
fragments were ligated to beads and an emulsion PCR was
performed following manufacturer’s specifications. The
beads containing the amplified sequences were transferred
to a PicoTiterPlateTM for sequencing on the Genome
Sequencer FLXTM (Droege & Hill 2008).

Mining and primer development of 454 sequences for
microsatellite loci
The MID and MseI adaptors were removed from the
obtained sequences before further analyses were conducted. The program MSATCOMMANDER VERSION 0.8.2 (Faircloth 2008) was then used to identify sequences
containing repeat motifs (di-, tri-, tetra- and pentanucleo-

tides) from the 454 sequences of both species. Sequences
containing five or more repeats were detected and then
aligned to eliminate any duplicated repeat fragments
using CLUSTAL X VERSION 1.64b (Thompson et al. 1997). The
remaining sequences were selected for primer development with PRIMER 3 VERSION 1.1.1 (Rozen & Skaletsky 2000).
From this, a stringent selection process was implemented
where only pure tri- or tetranucleotide repeats of more
than eight repeats were chosen for characterization in HS
and WS. Tri- and tetranucleotide repeats were chosen
over dinucleotide repeats as there is less slippage during
the PCRs that would lead to more accurate genotype
scoring (Edwards et al. 1991).

Microsatellite characterization in the two focal species
A panel of 16 individuals of each focal species was used
to optimize PCR amplification and identify polymorphic
loci in each species. PCRs were prepared in 10 lL volumes with approximately 50 ng of genomic DNA,
1· PCR buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM KCl, pH 8.4),
0.4 U Supertherm Taq polymerase (Southern Cross Biotechnologies), 1.5–2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 pmol of the forward
and reverse primers (Inqaba Biotec) and 0.2 mM dNTPs
(Promega). The PCR conditions were the following: 94 C
for 5 min followed with 94 C for 30 s, 50–61 C for 30 s
and 72 C for 45 s for 35 cycles and a final elongation step
of 72 C for 20 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed through 2% agarose gels and visualized with
GelRedTM Acid stain (Biotium). For optimized loci (those
with good and consistent amplification), the PCR was
repeated with 0.02 pmol fluorescently labelled ChromaTide Rhodamine GreenTM-5-dUTPs (Invitrogen); these are
labelled dNTPs that are incorporated during the PCR
allowing PCR fragment separation and visualization on an
automated sequencer. Genotyping was carried out using
GeneScan software on an ABI 3100 automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the
GeneScan LizTM 500 Size Standard (Applied Biosystems).
For all polymorphic loci, the forward primer was fluorescently labelled with the G5 dye set including 6-FAM,
VIC, NED and PET (Applied Biosystems). These loci
were genotyped in 50 individuals of each species (HS
and WS) using the Quantitect Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen)
following the criteria recommended by the manufacturer.
Approximately 20 ng of genomic DNA, half the final volume of Quantitect multiplex master mix and 0.2 pmol of
each labelled forward and reverse primer for each primer
set were included in the multiplex PCR (10 lL). The PCR
amplification protocol entailed 95 C for 15 min followed
by 45 cycles of 94 C for 60 s and 60 C for 90 s. Forty HS
and 20 WS samples were amplified twice for all microsatellite loci to determine genotyping error. The multiplex
combinations for these species are indicated in Table 1.

Sequencing of homozygotes
Homozygotes for a selection of alleles from the de novo
developed microsatellite markers were amplified using
the protocol mentioned previously (using unlabelled
primers) and then sequenced to confirm repeat motif variation and allele scoring. The precipitated DNA product
was sequenced in the forward orientation only. The ABI
PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready
Reaction kit VERSION 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) was used to
perform the cycle sequencing reaction on an ABI GeneAMP 9700 PCR system. The reactions contained
20–80 ng of purified template DNA, 1 lL of the BigDye
reaction mix, 3.2 pmol primer and 0.5· BigDye sequencing buffer. These were cycle sequenced and precipitated
using the manufacturer’s recommended conditions. The
sequencing reaction products were electrophoresed on
an ABI 3130 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
The chromatograms were visualized with BIOEDIT VERSION
7.0.2 (Hall 1999).

Cross-species amplification and correlation testing
Markers identified to be polymorphic in the HS and WS
were used to verify the transferability of the microsatellite
markers to other sparid species. Additional microsatellite
loci were included to increase the number of cross-species markers (Table 1). However, these were not included
when testing for a correlation between marker transferability and genetic divergence. First, primers were
designed for two unpublished repeat loci identified
through a GenBank search (Table 1, SA043 & PA535).
Moreover, two published microsatellites Pb-OVI-D106
(Piñera et al. 2006) and Clat11 (Teske et al. 2009) were
included. These loci were optimized as described earlier. The additional nine species included for cross-species testing were chosen as they are of economic and
current research importance and also represent a
spread across the two major clades of the sparid phylogeny (Chiba et al. 2009). Also, cross-species testing of
the additional markers was conducted in the focal
species to increase the total number of markers for
population genetics studies.
To test for a correlation between genetic divergence
and transferability of loci, sequences for the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene were downloaded from GenBank for
the species included in this study as well as those from
previous cross-species studies in the Sparidae (Brown
et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2005; Piñera et al. 2006, 2007; Roques
et al. 2007a,b). Sequences were not available for some species, thus species in the same genus were included to provide an estimate of sequence divergence. The species
names and GenBank accession numbers are included in
Table S2 (Supporting information). Sequences were aligned

in CLUSTAL X, and sequence divergence was estimated as
the percentage of haplotype sequence differences (Kimura
2-parameter model) in PAUP VERSION 4.0b10 (Swofford
2003). The percentage of polymorphic loci and amplification success for all species was obtained for the de novo microsatellites of the focal species in each case and was
plotted against the genetic divergence of the species of
interest to the focal species. Then, the significance of the
correlation was evaluated using a simple linear regression
and measuring and testing the Pearson R parameter using
the program STATEXT VERSION 1.4.2b (http://www.statext.com). This regression allowed for the identification of
whether the transferability of these microsatellites were
dependent on the genetic divergence of 16S among members of the sparid family as observed by Carreras-Carbonell et al. (2008) within multiple fish families.

Data analysis of microsatellites
Genotypes were scored using GENEMARKER VERSION 1.5 software (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA). Observed
heterozygosity (HO) and expected heterozygosity (HE)
were calculated with GENETIX VERSION 4.05 (Belkhir et al.
1996–2004). Individuals were pooled from all locations
where the species were collected and deviations from
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and tests for linkage disequilibrium between loci were calculated with
GENEPOP VERSION 4.0 (Rousset 2008) for the loci that amplified in each species. The incidence of null alleles, scoring
errors owing to stuttering and evidence of large allele
dropout were determined using MICRO-CHECKER VERSION
2.2.3 (van Oosterhout et al. 2004). A Mann–Whitney test
was carried out between the number of alleles of HS and
WS from the de novo developed loci to compare levels of
polymorphism between the two species. This analysis
was conducted as a one-tailed test with the program
STATEXT.

Results
Isolation of SCRs through FIASCO and 454 sequencing
The number of sequences obtained from the HS and WS
libraries was 11076 and 7148, respectively, with a total of
4.5 Mbp sequenced. Of these, 4531 (41%) HS and 2839
(39%) WS sequences contained di-, tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide repeats with more than four repeat units.
Although only tetranucleotide repeats were probed for,
the enriched fraction contained di- to pentanucleotide
repeat types and base variations (Table S3, Supporting
information). The fragments ranged from 40 to 600 base
pairs (bp) in length with the majority of sequences being
between 120 and 400 bp for both species (Fig. S1,
Supporting information). The 7370 sequences were exten-

sively mined and a total of 494 unique SCR with sufficient flanking region were identified. Primers could be
designed for 302 of these sequences (149 from WS and
153 from HS) of which 193 sequences contained more
than eight repeat units (63%). The sequence name, repeat
type, number of repeats, primers and expected PCR fragment size are summarized in Table S3 (Supporting information; It should be noted that this table excludes the
sequences further characterized in this study). To summarize, from the 302 potential loci (149 WS and 153 PB),
there were a total of 139 dinucleotides, 47 trinucleotides,
115 tetranucleotides and one pentanucleotide that met
the criteria for primer design.
Twenty sequences containing tetranucleotide repeats
for HS and 40 sequences containing either tri- or tetrarepeats for WS were selected for further characterization.
Twelve potential loci amplified the expected fragment
size for the HS (60%) with nine of these loci being polymorphic (75%). Nineteen loci in the WS (48%) amplified
the expected fragment size with nine being polymorphic
(47%, Table 1). The loci that did not amplify require
either further optimization effort or redesigned primers.
Of the 302 potentially polymorphic markers identified in
this study, we successfully characterized 31 loci (11%).
Of these loci, 58% were polymorphic. The regenotyped
individuals in HS and WS showed no evidence of genotyping errors indicating that the multiplexes were robust.
No linkage disequilibrium was identified between these
loci in both species, suggesting that they can all be considered as unlinked and informative. Some microsatellite
loci in HS (PBt006, PBt018) and WS (LLt005, LLt024)
significantly deviated from HWE. The program MICROCHECKER detected the presence of null alleles at these four
loci, with frequencies estimated as 25.73%, 6.54%, 11.43%
and 33.24%, respectively. There was no evidence of scoring error owing to stuttering or large allele dropout for
the HS microsatellites. Locus LLt024 showed scoring
errors in the WS which could be explained by its inconsistent amplification and the presence of stuttering. The
general summary statistics for these markers are detailed
in Table 2. The Mann–Whitney test showed a significant
difference between the number of alleles identified at the
de novo developed microsatellite loci between the focal
species (U-value = 10.5; P-value = 0.002) which potentially indicates a difference in genetic diversity of these
endemic sparids.

Sequencing of homozygotes
A selection of the homozygous alleles was Sanger
sequenced for the microsatellite loci of HS and WS.
Sequencing was not performed for PBt006 and LLtr024
because of inconsistent amplification and the high
percentage of null alleles at these loci. From the Sanger

 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

sequencing of alleles, almost all markers showed conserved flanking regions and the varying lengths of the
alleles were because of variation in the number of repeats
(Table S4, Supporting information). The exception was
marker PBt012, which showed a high level of variability
in the flanking region and the allele length did not fully
match the tetranucleotide repeat unit length. This mismatch may be explained by both the presence of a polymorphic region with mononucleotide variants and an
indel immediately upstream of the repeat region
(Table S4, Supporting information). Also, sequencing
errors were identified in the 454 sequencing when compared to multiple Sanger sequences of several microsatellite loci. Most of these errors were found at A ⁄ T repeats;
this included either a single base missing (PBt001,
PBt013, PBt014, LLt007, LLt011 & LLtr004) or one extra
base added (PBt018 & LLt011) in the 454 sequencing.

Transferability of loci in the Sparidae
The eighteen newly developed markers and four previously identified microsatellites (PA535, SA043, Pb-OVID106 and Clat11) were tested in nine sparid species and
the focal species. The characteristics and summary statistics including NA, HO, HE, allele size range and deviation
from HWE for each species are given in Table 2. The
cross-species transferability is summarized in Table 1.
The mean amplification success for cross-species amplification from this study was 48% (10 loci on average) and
the mean polymorphism success was 32% (seven loci).
The number of polymorphic loci identified ranged from
five in Chrysoblephus puniceus to 11 in Diplodus sargus capensis. For the two focal species (HS and WS), a total of 13
polymorphic markers were identified in the WS (nine de
novo developed and four through cross-species amplification) and 16 in the HS (nine developed and seven
through cross-species amplification).
Table 3 summarizes the sequence divergence based
on mtDNA 16S rRNA between the species as well as the
percentage of loci that amplified and were polymorphic
based on markers of the focal species in the present study
as well as previously conducted studies. Only the percentage of polymorphic loci was further characterized as
not all of the previous studies accurately indicated how
many markers amplified. In each case, the analysis only
includes the markers developed in the focal species, that
is, HS, WS or focal species from previous studies and 16S
genetic divergence from that focal species. From this
combined data set, there was a significant negative correlation between genetic distance and percentage of polymorphic loci (Fig. 1) for the Sparidae (Pearson R = )0.66;
P-value £ 0.001; y = )7.3336x + 84.634). When only the
two focal species from this study were analysed, there
was no significant correlation between genetic distance

Discussion
In this study, we used a newly implemented approach
(Santana et al. 2009) of combining the FIASCO protocol
(Zane et al. 2002) and 454 LifeSciences ⁄ Roche GS-FLX
sequencing to isolate de novo microsatellites in two
focal sparid species (HS and WS). From these data,
we were able to identify 302 unique loci that are
likely to provide an excellent resource for identifying
polymorphic microsatellite loci in all sparid species.
The loci selected for further characterization together

with four previously isolated loci (22 markers in total)
were tested through cross-species amplification on a
total of 11 sparid species. This panel of markers was
shown to have a high cross-taxon utility for members
of the Sparidae. Also, by combining data from previously developed microsatellites that were tested for
cross-species utility, we were able to identify a significant negative correlation of transferability vs. genetic
distance in the Sparidae. For sequence divergences
<4%, there is high cross-taxon utility, whereas above
this divergence, the cross-taxon utility decreases and
becomes relatively unpredictable. Given our results
and those of Carreras-Carbonell et al. (2008), which
identified a similar trend using mtDNA 16S rRNA in
nine fish families, we are confident that this is

valuable information applicable to sparids and other
fish families, but it may not apply across all vertebrates and other taxa.

Development of microsatellites with 454 GS-FLX
sequencing
The protocol followed in this study (FIASCO ⁄ 454)
allowed for the identification of a large portion of SCRs
(41% in HS & 39% WS) and from this, identification of a
total of 302 potentially polymorphic microsatellite markers for the Sparidae. Using only a small fraction of SCRs
(<11%), we were able to identify nine polymorphic loci in
each of the two focal species (HS and WS; Table 1). Markers developed in the HS were highly variable with an
average of 17 alleles per locus compared with the WS that
had an average of 10 alleles per locus. Through this efficient protocol, we were able to identify a suitable number
of high-quality microsatellites in two endemic sparids.
Our specific protocol yielded a high percentage of
SCRs and proved to be highly efficient in comparison
with recently published 454 data that did not enrich for
repeats (Table S5, Supporting information). A brief survey (summarized in Table S5, Supporting information)
which included 23 studies and 41 species that used 454
sequencing directly (20 species; average 4.6% SCRs) or
following enrichment (21 species; average 21% SCRs)
showed a significant difference when the percentage of
SCRs were compared using a simple linear regression
(Fig. 2, Mann-Whitney U-test: U = 50.0, P < 0.001,
http://www.statext.com). Our results indicate that with
substantially less 454 sequencing effort (1 ⁄ 5th of a single
454 sequencing lane, i.e. lower costs) we were able to
achieve a sufficient number of sequences containing
potential loci by enriching first (40% SCRs; Table S5,
Supporting information).

Enrichment

Fig. 2 Average pecentage of sequences containing repeats in
454 sequencing studies that enriched before sequencing and
those that did not. Significant differences were obtained between
the studies (Mann–Whitney test, U = 50.0, P < 0.001).

The success of identifying SCRs depends on the targeted taxa, which in turn will affect the amount of effort
needed to identify a sufficient number of markers. Marine fish, for instance, present higher frequencies of SCRs
and polymorphic loci than other groups such as reptiles,
birds and bats (Neff & Gross 2001). This is also reflected
when comparing our sequencing results to species such
as inbred tree lines (Arabis alpine; 0.8% SCRs; Buehler
et al. 2011) and bats (Artibeus lituratus; 10% SCRs; McCulloch & Stevens 2011) which are both known to be challenging when it comes to developing microsatellite
markers. In the study by Malausa et al. (2011), no significant difference was found when comparing the percentage of SCRs obtained between an enriched fraction (15%
SCRs) and nonenriched fraction (14% SCRs) from Apis
mellifera. Also, a study by Abdelkrim et al. (2009)
predicted that sequencing a 1 ⁄ 16 plate should identify
approximately 6000–7000 SCRs without enrichment for
repeat-containing sequences. Using this prediction, we
would expect approximately 2800 SCRs in our study
(2 ⁄ 5ths of a single 454 sequencing lane of a 16 lane plate).
By doing the enrichment protocol first, we were able to
achieve 2.6 times more sequences (7370). Our results
indicate that spending a small amount of time and effort
to enrich for repeats substantially increase the number of
repeats found even with considerably less 454 sequencing effort.
The advantages of using this combined protocol are
numerous. First, the enrichment for repeat-containing
sequences allows for the sequencing of more potentially polymorphic microsatellite loci. Second, using 454
LifeSciences ⁄ Roche GS-FLX sequencing instead of cloning is time efficient and cost-effective as has been
shown by recent studies (Abdelkrim et al. 2009; Santana
et al. 2009; Csencsics et al. 2010). The number of
sequences generated with 454 sequencing is more than
is feasible with cloning, which provides more options
for selecting high-quality sequences and higher success
rates in isolating microsatellite repeat-containing loci

750 K . R E I D , T . B . H O A R E A U a n d P . B L O O M E R
(Malausa et al. 2011). Also, with cloning, to identify
approximately 300 unique loci with sufficient flanking
region (as in our study), it would cost two to three
times more than with the 454 method and also take a
considerably longer time.
There are some potential disadvanges to using 454
sequencing to develop microsatellite markers; however,
they are all relatively easy to overcome. There are always
a large portion of the sequences obtained that do not contain repeats; however, these are still useful as they may
contain nonrepeat intervening DNA or gene-associated
fragments (Burrell et al. 2011), which may be further
developed into molecular markers. Those fragments containing repeats may not always have enough flanking
region for primer design but many sequences are
obtained, thus there are still often hundreds of SCRs with
sufficient flanking region which allows for more stringent
selection of sequences for optimization and genotyping
(Gardner et al. 2011; Guichoux et al. 2011). Also, alternative methods, such as genome walking exist, that allow
for the recovery of extended flanking regions of potentially polymorphic loci, for example, the APAgene GOLD
genome walking kit (BioS&T). There are also some known
sequencing discrepancies (insertions or deletions of false
bases) that occur with 454 sequencing at A ⁄ T homopolymer runs (Moore et al. 2006). These are normally identified and compensated for when there is more than a
onefold coverage and the same region is sequenced multiple times. Owing to the small fractions used in this study
(only 1 ⁄ 5th of a 454 sequencing lane per species), there
was generally only a onefold coverage of each repeat locus
identified.
Sanger sequencing of a selected set of homozygotes
(Table S3, Supporting information) showed a number of
sequencing errors (50% of loci) in the 454 sequencing
data, mainly consisting of insertions or deletions of A ⁄ T
repeats. Also, through Sanger sequencing, we identified
some variation in the flanking region (homoplasy) of a
locus (PBt012) that could potentially affect its suitability
in population genetics studies. With the exception of this
locus, Sanger sequence data confirmed the reliability and
suitability of the other markers developed in this study
(Table S4, Supporting information).

Transferability of microsatellites in the Sparidae
Identifying polymorphic microsatellite loci through
cross-species amplification allows for the detection of
loci in nonmodel organisms without the cost and time
of developing a de novo set (Zane et al. 2002). Through
cross-species amplification of the polymorphic loci
included in this study, we were able to establish a
panel of 22 microsatellites (18 newly developed and
four additional markers) that showed polymorphism

across various sparids which are representative of the
two major clades of Sparidae (Chiba et al. 2009). These
sparid species are all of current economic or research
importance to South African fisheries and for a number
of these species no additional microsatellite loci would
be required.
In the two focal species, we were able to increase the
number of polymorphic loci through the cross-species
amplification. Therefore, seven additional loci were identified in the HS (total 16) and four in the WS (total 13).
For the nine additional sparid species included, crossspecies amplification identified on average seven polymorphic loci per species.
Gathering data from multiple cross-species amplification studies on sparids (21 species from 14 genera in
total), a negative correlation was found between genetic
divergence (based on mtDNA 16S rRNA) and microsatellite transferability (polymorphism; Fig. 1). The divergence data ranged from approximately 1–11%, with
divergence of <4% showing high transferability success
(75–88%) and divergence >10% with very low transferability. For divergence higher than 4%, it was not possible to predict accurately which focal species would
provide the most polymorphic loci in a species of interest. Carreras-Carbonell et al. (2008) observed that high
transferability is only observed when genetic divergence
of 16S is <5% across the 63 fish species. Taking into
account only the microsatellite loci from this study, we
found that there was a 48% chance to amplify a microsatellite locus in another sparid species and a 32% chance
that it would be polymorphic, which is slightly higher
than was suggested across different fish studies (25%)
reviewed by Barbará et al. (2007). Using these estimates,
we can infer that on average there is the potential to
identify 96 polymorphic loci in any sparid species
from the 302 loci identified in this study. A study by Liu
et al. (2007) identified 16 polymorphic markers for
Acanthopagrus schlegeli after cross-species tests using 68
loci from six sparid species (24% success). This indicates
that other species-specific biological factors (e.g. bottlenecks, expansions, life history traits) might also influence
the transferability of loci when species are genetically
divergent (>4%).
This study showed the usefulness of using
FIASCO ⁄ 454 sequencing for de novo microsatellite marker development in marine fish. Although there are
some limitations to using 454 sequencing instead of
cloning, these are only a few and can be easily overcome. The microsatellite loci identified as polymorphic
in the two focal species will be used in current populations genetic studies as both species are of commercial
and ⁄ or conservation importance to South African fisheries. Moreover, the broad level of applicability of these
newly developed markers across a large number of spe-

cies shows that the 302 potentially polymorphic microsatellite markers we developed provide an important
resource for future population genetics studies in other
members of the Sparidae. Developing large numbers of
microsatellite markers from sequencing partial (as with
small-scale 454 sequencing) or whole genomes and
assessing their level of transferability in closely related
taxa will greatly reduce the costs of population genetics
studies by removing the marker development step in
the near future.
