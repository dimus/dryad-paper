from the ant subfamily Formicinae. Evidence for the monophyly of this group is provided by morphological characters (LaPolla et al., 2010a) and molecular phylogenetic analyses (Brady et al., 2006; Moreau et al., 2006; LaPolla et al., 2010a). Prenolepis genus-group species are generally smallto-medium sized ants, possessing roughly triangular mandibles with between four and seven teeth, and 12-segmented antennae. Many species are generalist omnivores that inhabit the soil, leaf litter and rotten wood on the ground, where they form large

Abstract. The ant genus Prenolepis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is the nominal member of the recently established Prenolepis genus-group within the subfamily Formicinae. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses using fragments from five nuclear genes (arginine kinase, carbomoylphosphate synthase, elongation factor 1-alpha F1, elongation factor 1-alpha F2, wingless) and one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome oxidase I ) indicate that this genus is polyphyletic. Although the majority of Prenolepis species was found to belong to the same monophyletic group (Prenolepis sensu stricto), a smaller subset of Prenolepis species, all found in either Central America or the Greater Antilles, was robustly inferred to comprise a distinct lineage that is sister to the Old World genus Paraparatrechina. Here we describe this newly discovered lineage within the larger Prenolepis genus-group clade. The genus Zatania, gen.n. is composed of five extant species (Zatania albimaculata, Zatania cisipa, Zatania gibberosa, Zatania gloriosa, sp.n. and Zatania karstica) and one Dominican amber fossil species (Zatania electra†, sp.n.). These are medium-sized ants (generally between 2.5 and 3 mm in total length) that are characterized by having long scapes and legs, and elongated mesosomata. A reliance on worker-based taxonomy has previously prevented the discovery of this new lineage because of worker convergence consisting of various combinations of elongated mesosomata, long scapes and legs, and a constriction immediately behind the pronotum, observed in several distinct lineages within the Prenolepis genus-group. However, we did find that male morphology complements our molecular results in revealing important diagnostic and potentially phylogenetically informative characters. Our study highlights the value for ant systematics to expand beyond its traditional foundation of worker-based morphology and embrace character systems from other castes and molecular data.

nests. LaPolla et al. (2010a) provide a comprehensive review of the general morphology and biology of the group.
Efforts to understand the phylogenetic relationships within the Prenolepis genus-group led to the possibility that the genus Prenolepis might not be monophyletic. LaPolla et al. (2010a) found that Greater Antillean Prenolepis species may represent a distinct lineage that is sister to the Old World Paraparatrechina rather than to other species within Prenolepis, including the widespread North American species Prenolepis imparis. At the time of that study, there was only one representative species of this putative new lineage in the molecular phylogeny, so no taxonomic actions were taken.
To explore the identity of this Greater Antillean lineage, we generated molecular data from additional taxa, expanded our data to include several more gene fragments and conducted a detailed morphological examination. We conclude that not only does the Greater Antillean Prenolepis truly represent a separate lineage (the first suggestion that these species formed a monophyletic group came from Fontenla, 2000), but a species presently placed in Nylanderia also belongs to this lineage, as does a previously undescribed species from Central America. Additionally, a recently examined Dominican amber fossil species was also found to belong to this newly discovered lineage.
Here we describe this lineage as a new genus of ants found in the Greater Antilles and Central America (Fig. 1). We also argue that reliance on worker-based taxonomy has previously hindered the discovery of this new lineage because of repeating morphological forms in this caste shared by several distinct lineages within the Prenolepis genus-group. Our study thus highlights the value for ant systematics to expand beyond its traditional foundation of worker-based morphology and embrace character systems from other castes as well as molecular data.

Molecular work
We tested the monophyly of Zatania using molecular phylogenetic data from 34 Prenolepis genus-group species and four outgroup genera. Multiple representatives from all Prenolepis genus-group genera were included. We sampled four of the five extant species of Zatania (only Zatania karstica is missing). We included two exemplars of the only known New World species of Prenolepis (P . imparis ) sampled from opposite longitudinal ends of North America (Arizona and Maryland) and seven Old World species from this genus.
Sampled ants were preserved in ethanol or pinned dry prior to extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole ants (except from Zatania gibberosa, which was sampled
nondestructively) using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, U.S.A.), following the manufacturer’s standard protocol. Vouchers consisting of nestmate specimens from the same collection event are deposited in the National Museum of Natural History and the California Academy of Sciences (Table 1).
We generated DNA sequence data from five nuclear protein coding genes – arginine kinase (ArgK ), carbomoylphosphate synthase (CAD ), elongation factor 1-alpha F1 (EF1αF1 ), elongation factor 1-alpha F2 (EF1αF2 ) and wingless – and from the mitochondrial protein-coding gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI ). Primers and PCR protocols follow Brady et al. (2006) and LaPolla et al. (2010a), except that the current study also includes an extended fragment from CAD and the new gene ArgK. Primers for these new fragments are from

Ward et al. (2010). Sequence chromatograms were assembled and edited using sequencher 4.10 and combined into a phylogenetic matrix using macclade (Maddison & Maddison, 2000). All intron sequences were removed from all analyses; the resulting exon-only matrix was easily and unambiguously aligned in macclade. The final data matrix contained a total of 4332 nucleotide characters (1011 of which were parsimony informative, PI) from the following gene fragments: ArgK, 673 characters (144 PI); CAD, 924 characters (183 PI); EF1αF1, 776 characters (110 PI); EF1αF2, 517 characters (77 PI); wingless, 400 characters (101 PI); and COI, 1042 characters (396 PI). GenBank accession numbers are reported in Table 1.
We used Bayesian inference (BI) to estimate tree topologies and branch lengths using mrbayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck, 2003) parallelized over eight Mac G5 processors. The data were partitioned by gene and, within each gene, by codon positions (1 + 2) and 3, for a total of 12 partitions. The best-fitting model for each partition was selected using jmodeltest (Posada, 2008) under the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). All parameters were unlinked across partitions except branch lengths and topology. Partition-specific branch length rate multipliers (m) were unlinked and initially assigned a Dirichlet prior (ratepr = variable). Four independent runs were initiated using random topologies with branch length priors of brlenspr = Unconstrained:Exponential(100) to avoid becoming trapped in parameter space with distorted branch lengths and partition rate multipliers (Marshall, 2010). Each run was distributed across four chains with a heating parameter of 0.05 (compared with the default setting of 0.2): this was to increase mixing among chains. Runs were conducted for 50 million generations with a burn-in of 10 million generations. Convergence between independent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs was verified using potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) values (1.00 for all taxon bipartitions), the average standard deviation of split frequencies (0.001 by 10 million generations) and by plotting likelihood values across generations using tracer 1.5 (Rambaut & Drummond, 2007). The resulting post burn-in trees from all four runs (a total of 160 million generations) were combined to infer posterior probabilities of clades and branch lengths.
We also conducted bootstrap analyses under maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) criteria. We used garli 2.0 (Zwickl, 2006) to infer 1000 partitioned ML bootstrap replicates using the same partitioning scheme and models as the BI analyses. MP bootstrap values were calculated using paup* 4.0a114 (Swofford, 2002). We performed 1000 bootstrap replicates, with each round consisting of 20 randomaddition sequence replicates, with ten trees held at each step, with tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and no limit to maxtrees.
We translated our nucleotide matrix using macclade to create a concatenated amino acid matrix in order to identify potential synapomorphies for Zatania at the amino acid level. Both concatenated matrices (nucleotide and amino acid) are archived and publically available through the Dryad digital repository (http://datadryad.org) under doi:10.5061/dryad.2408n.
New ant genus from the Greater Antilles and Central America 203 Results
Molecular phylogeny
The four Zatania species included in the molecular phylogeny (Fig. 2) together are monophyletic with strong support under all analytical methods: BI posterior probabilities (PP) = 1.0; ML bootstrap proportions (BP) = 100; MP BP = 100. Within this genus, Zatania albimaculata and Z. gibberosa are sister species with strong support (BI PP = 1.0; ML BP = 100; MP BP = 100); the species Zatania cisipa resolves as sister to (Z. albimaculata + Z. gibberosa) with strong support under BI (PP = 0.99), but with weaker bootstrap support (ML = 79 and MP = 59). Examination of the translated amino acid matrix identifies two unique amino acid residues found in all four Zatania species and no other taxa in our matrix: proline in wingless (position 82 in our concatenated amino acid matrix) and methionine in EF1αF1 (position 896). Furthermore, all Zatania species except Zatania gloriosa exclusively possess isoleucine in ArgK (position 1261).
The genus Zatania resolves as the sister group to Paraparatrechina with strong support from BI (PP = 0.98), but with weaker bootstrap support (ML = 71 and MP = 61). Prenolepis is recovered as a monophyletic unit (after the taxonomic removal of Z. albimaculata and Z. gibberosa; see below) with strong support: BI PP = 1.0; ML BP = 100; MP BP = 100. The only known New World species, P. imparis, is nested well within a grade of Old World Prenolepis species. All other Prenolepis-group genera are also reconstructed as monophyletic with robust support (Fig. 2). The genus Prenolepis is sister to all other genera within the Prenolepis genus-group.

Description of Zatania, gen.n.
Type species of the genus: Zatania cisipa (Smith &
Lavigne, 1973)
Etymology. The derivation of the genus name is a combination of the Greek prefix za (very) and tany (long), in reference to the long scapes, mesosomata and legs of species in this genus; it is a feminine noun.
Worker . Monomorphic, medium-sized (2 – 3 mm in total length) formicine ants, ranging in colour from brownish yellow to brown and reddish brown. Head with pubescence, and erect setae found along head margin; medially erect setae roughly

paired, extended through medial portion of clypeus. Cuticle sculpturing variable; in some species opaque and slightly rugose, as in Z. albimaculata; in other species cuticle smooth and shining as in Z. cisipa and Z. gloriosa.
Antennae 12-segmented; scapes long (Fig. 3A), surpassing posterior margin by at least the length of the first four funicular segments. Scapes with either a dense layer of short erect setae and/or a layer of appressed setae that in some species is fairly scattered. Head longer than wide [cephalic index well below 100 (our recorded range, 75–87)].
Eyes medium to large, relative to head size; in Z. cisipa and Z. gloriosa eyes distinctly convex; three small, indistinct ocelli present.
Mandibles typical for a Prenolepis genus-group taxon, with five or six teeth: Z. albimaculata, Z. gibberosa and Z. karstica have five teeth; Z. cisipa and Z. gloriosa have six teeth; however, the tooth between the basal tooth and tooth 4 is much smaller than the other teeth, and is often missing, leaving a diastema between the basal tooth and tooth 4, effectively making the mandible five-toothed. Palps 6:4 segmented and long (at least as long as head).
Mesosoma distinctly elongated; in profile pronotum and mesonotum long; pronotum rises at less than 45◦ angle to mesonotum; in profile roughly triangular in shape at segment dividing pronotum and mesonotum; in some species mesonotum constricted immediately behind pronotum (Z. albimaculata and Zatania electra† possess the most extreme example of this character state); between 4–10 pronotal setae present.
Propodeum variable: in Z. albimaculata, Z. electra † , Z. gibberosa and Z. karstica, propodeum dorsal face dome-like
and higher than remainder of mesosoma; in Z. cisipa and Z. gloriosa dorsal face gently rounded and not higher than remainder of mesosoma. In Z. gibberosa dorsal face with abundant short erect setae; in other species, dorsal face with only scattered or no erect setae. Petiole cuneate, broadly rounded dorsally and not surpassing height of propodeum.
Legs notably long; in darker coloured species, tarsi lighter in colour than remainder of leg.
Gaster robust, densely covered with erect setae and in some species with layer of pubescence.
Queen. Queensgenerallyhavethesamecoloration(although they are typically darker), setation and pubescence patterns as seen in workers.
Male. (males only examined in Z. cisipa, Z. electra†, Z. gibberosa and Z. gloriosa)
Coloration similar to workers, but generally lighter overall. Cuticle surface, pubescence and setation patterns generally follow worker morphology.
Antennae 13-segmented; scapes long, as in workers, with similar pubescence and setation patterns.
Head shape variable; in Z. cisipa and Z. gloriosa compound eyes very large and convex, taking up most of lateral margin, with three very large ocelli; in Z. gibberosa compound eyes and ocelli considerably smaller, and head more similar to worker in general shape.
Mandibles in Z. cisipa and Z. gloriosa with prominent, pointed apical tooth; remainder of masticatory margin smooth, with indistinct, rounded basal angle that seamlessly blends into inner mandibular margin. In Z. gibberosa mandible also with prominent, pointed apical tooth, but masticatory margin serrated into generally indistinct denticles, most prominent and tooth-like immediately behind apical tooth; basal angle rounded, but more distinct than observed in Z. cisipa and Z. gloriosa; as in workers, palps 6:4 segmented and long.
Mesosoma robust, with small collar-like pronotum, overarched by rounded and prominent mesonotum; dorsal and declivitous faces of propodeum difficult to distinguish; propodeum linear in profile, at approximately a 45◦ angle.
Legs long as in workers.
Gaster generally similar to workers. Genitalia variable by species, but with some generally similar characteristics: parameres elongate and narrow; digiti and cuspi meet dorsally; digiti and cuspi shorter than aedeagal valves; digiti and cuspi very similar in overall shape and conformation (see Figs 28, 38).

[Figs 4–7 (worker)]
Prenolepis gibberosa albimaculata Santschi, 1930: 81 (worker described). Type locality: Cuba: Piedra Gorda, Baracoa (depository of type specimens unknown). Fontenla, 2000: 81, raised to species (here confirmed).
Worker diagnosis. Head and mesosoma reddish brown, with darker gaster; head with scattered erect setae and only sparse pubescence; scapes with dense layer of short, erect setae; head cuticle slightly rugose; mesosoma with scattered short, erect setae and sparse pubescence; strong constriction immediately behind pronotum; dorsal face of propodeum convex with only very scattered erect setae and pubescence.
Measurements (n = 2): TL 2.20 – 2.40 mm; HW 0.66 – 0.68 mm; HL 0.78–0.85 mm; EL 0.17–0.2 mm; SL 1.30– 1.40 mm; PW 0.42–0.47 mm; WL 1.43–1.47 mm; PrFL 0.98– 1.10 mm; PrFW 0.14 mm; GL 0.98–1.1 mm.
Indices: CI 80–85; REL 22–23; SI 201–205.
Notes. Workers of this species most closely resemble Z. gibberosa with regards to coloration, but Z. albimaculata is smaller, less robust and possesses much less pilosity. We have not seen males of Z. albimaculata, but based on Fontenla (2000) there appears to be significant differences in male genitalic characters that also separate these two species. Fontenla (2000) reported that this species mostly forages in trees.

Worker diagnosis. Overall brownish yellow, with darker gaster; head with layer of pubescence and distinctly convex eyes; scapes with dense layer of short, slender, decumbent setae; mesosoma with scattered erect setae on pronotum and mesonotum; dorsal face of propodeum gently rounded; gaster with dense layer of pubescence.
Measurements (n = 6): TL 2.50 – 2.70 mm; HW 0.6 – 0.63 mm; HL 0.76–0.78 mm; EL 0.24–0.26 mm; SL 1.00– 1.20 mm; PW 0.46 – 0.50 mm; WL 1.10 – 1.33 mm; PrFL 0.83–0.88 mm; PrFW 0.16–0.18 mm; GL 1.22–1.40 mm. Indices: CI 78–81; REL 30–33; SI 154–176.
Notes. This is the only yellow species known in the genus, and is therefore easy to identify. The yellow coloration is probably an adaptation, reflecting the fact that workers are nocturnal foragers (J.S. LaPolla, personal observation). At El Verde Field Station in Puerto Rico, during the day no workers were ever seen foraging, but at night it was one of the most commonly encountered ant species, often observed in large foraging trails with hundreds of individual workers moving on the forest floor. This appears to be a tree hollow-nesting species, as nests were observed by both Smith & Lavigne (1973) and J.S. LaPolla in living tree hollows at a height of about 1–1.5 m from the ground.

  Fig. 30. Zatania electra†: A, photograph of holotype worker; B, illustration of holotype worker.
Etymology. The species epithet is in reference to the fact that this is a fossil species found in amber (electra is Greek for amber).
Notes. This is the only fossil species known in the genus. The workers, with respect to some morphological features, resemble the workers of Z. albimaculata and Z. karstica, especially with regards to the relatively small size of the compound eyes and the constriction of the mesosoma immediately behind the pronotum. The dome-like propodeum is most similar to Z. gibberosa and Z. karstica. The apparently uniform body colour of the fossil species is only shared with Z. karstica among extant species. Interestingly, however, despite the similarities of the workers to the three mentioned extant species, the narrow male parameres most closely resemble those of Z. cisipa and Z. gloriosa. The narrow head of the Z. electra worker is most similar to what is observed in Z. gloriosa † . It therefore appears that Z. electra † has an interesting combination of morphological features observed among all of the known extant species.

see below) with abundant erect setae and pubescence; scapes with very dense layer of suberect pubescence; dorsal face of propodeum distinctly dome-like and with abundant erect setae.

Indices: CI 82–87; REL 20–24; SI 180–189.
Notes. This species has the largest and most robust workers within the genus; the large, pilose workers of this species effectively separate it from other species. It possesses abundant erect setae on the head and mesosoma, including the propodeum, which is in contrast to Z. albimaculata, the species most likely to be confused with Z. gibberosa. Mann (1920) described a variety of Z. gibberosa (var. rogeri, then in Prenolepis) based on the gaster being shiny as opposed to opaque. Fontenla (2000) stated that this character was variable and that the morphological division between opaque and shiny gasters was unclear. In fact we have seen specimens in which the gaster is both shiny in some places and opaque in other places. There is also some variation in the size of workers (suggesting workers might be slightly polymorphic), worker coloration and mesosomal setation (Fontenla, 2000), but with the fairly low number of specimens available for this study we cannot correlate these morphological characters in such a way that suggests there is more than one species present (as opposed to geographical variation). However, this species is reported from across Cuba and into Haiti (although interestingly it has not be collected from the Dominican Republic), and a more detailed study is needed to determine if cryptic species are present. For now we maintain the synonymy established by Fontenla (2000), until additional data suggest otherwise. Both Mann (1920) and Fontenla (2000) report Z. gibberosa from forests; Mann observed nests in decayed logs. Where it occurs, it is apparently an active (workers move about quickly) and abundant species.

Species description
Worker. Overall coloration brown, with areas of brownish yellow across body; cuticle smooth and shining. Head distinctly longer than wide (CI 76–78) and strongly oval in shape; mandibles brownish yellow, typically with six teeth (although in some specimens fifth tooth between basal tooth and fourth tooth small and sometimes abraded away or otherwise missing); posterolateral corners of head indistinct and rounded; posterior margin short; erect macrosetae concentrated medially, where they are roughly paired and along head margins; head with layer of pubescence. Scapes surpass posterior margin by length of first five funicular segments; scapes lacking erect setae, but layer of pubescence present; antennae lighter than head, becoming brownish yellow to yellow around torulae and proximal end of scapes and funiculus.

Queen. Generally matches worker description, with modifications expected for caste. Coloration pattern generally similar to workers, but darker brown and more white found on funiculus, mesosoma, legs and gaster than in workers.
Male. Overall coloration with yellowish brown head, yellow antennae and remainder of body golden brown.

setae on scapes, mesonotum or propodeum; whitish pubescence scattered across body; dorsal face of propodeum distinctly dome-like.
Notes. The workers of this species are the only extant species that is uniformly coloured, making them relatively easy to identify. Fontenla (2000) discussed the interesting behaviour of Z. karstica workers. In other Zatania species workers are fast-moving individuals (not surprising given the long legs observed in workers), but in Z. karstica the workers are slower (although Fontenla did not qualify this), and they often display what he termed a frozen pose as they moved along. Fontenla (2000) suggested that this behaviour was related to the fact that the species is putatively restricted to living on limestone mogotes, and that the coloration of Z. karstica mimics Temnothorax ants (Temnothorax gundlachi and T. poeyi), with which it lives sympatrically. It has been suggested that the coloration of the Temnothorax ants is aposematic (Wilson, 1988; Fontenla, 1995), and therefore Fontenla (2000) speculated that Z. karstica is engaged in some kind of convergent mimicry to protect them against Anolis lizards, presumably one of their main predators. We have not personally observed this species in the field, but Z. karstica may be an interesting candidate for the study of adaptations (morphological and behavioural) of ants to living on limestone mogotes.
Discussion
Fontenla (2000) provided an initial attempt at a morphological phylogeny for Prenolepis. This phylogeny contained relatively few taxa (12 species included), and was inferred using solely worker-based morphology. It uncovered a monophyletic group containing Z. albimaculata, Z. gibberosa and Z. karstica (all three were then classified as Prenolepis), and he was the first to suggest that Prenolepis might not be monophyletic. He cites oval pronotal shape and nesting behaviour (arboreal or limestone nesting) as the two synapomorphies for these three species. We are not certain as to what he meant by the oval pronotum character, but the pronotal shape of Zatania workers is different from many Prenolepis species (see below), especially the North American P. imparis. Zatania gloriosa seems to nest at least occasionally in the ground, so the genus is not exclusively restricted to arboreal or limestone nest sites (but the other four extant species are putatively not ground nesting). However, based on our phylogeny, arboreal and limestone nesting species do form a monophyletic group within the genus, and interestingly these are all from the Greater Antilles.
Our molecular phylogeny confirms that Zatania represents a lineage of ants distinct from Prenolepis and all other genera within the genus-group. The three new Zatania species we added to our phylogenetic analyses cluster together with Z. albimaculata from LaPolla et al. (2010a) with high posterior probabilities (1.0) and bootstrap values (100), strongly supporting the monophyly of this genus. Inspection of our molecular matrix also identifies several amino acid changes that are unique within Zatania. Although our sampling within the Prenolepis genus-group is by no means comprehensive at
the species level, these amino acid characters may serve as synapomorphies for Zatania within the group.
The molecular data also suggest a sister-group relationship between Zatania and Paraparatrechina, although not all forms of phylogenetic analyses provide high support for this conclusion. Compared with LaPolla et al. (2010a), support for this relationship is considerably stronger in the current study, which includes additional taxa and molecular characters. Support values changed from BI PP = 0.79, ML BP < 50 and MP BP < 50 in LaPolla et al. (2010a) to BI PP = 0.99, ML BP = 71 and MP BP = 61 in the current study. Even given this trend, however, the current molecular data must still be viewed as reflecting some uncertainty concerning this relationship. We can also identify two morphological features of males that perhaps unite these two genera: narrow parameres and a similar-shaped aedeagal valve (LaPolla et al., 2010b). The aedeagal valves in the two genera share similarities with respect to a distinctly rounded ventral margin, with teeth present and a dorsal margin with a triangular section extending past the apodeme. Interestingly, a similarly shaped aedeagal valve is also observed in most species of Myrmecocystus (Snelling, 1976), which may indicate that this condition is pleisomorphic, or that it has evolved at least two times within the group.
In keys to the workers of New World formicine genera (Bolton, 1994; Fisher & Cover, 2007; LaPolla et al., 2010a), the species placed here in Zatania would key to the genus Prenolepis, in which three Zatania species were previously classified. There are several morphological features that provide a means to distinguish between these two genera. In the New World the only known Prenolepis species is P. imparis. Zatania species possess very long scapes, heads that are distinctly longer than wide (P. imparis has a head that is nearly as a wide as it is long), an elongated, linear pronotum in profile (in P. imparis the pronotum is short and distinctly rounded in profile) and distinctly long legs (especially the femur and tibia).
We provide a modified key that will allow Zatania workers to be distinguished from other genera within the Prenolepis genus-group. Zatania workers are most likely to be confused with Old World Prenolepis workers. At present, Zatania is only known from the Greater Antilles and Central America, and Prenolepis is absent from these areas, so Zatania workers could seemingly be separated from Prenolepis workers based on geography. As other ant genera, however, have been found to have a disjunct distribution between Asia and Central America (e.g. Longino & Hartley, 1994), it is possible that Zatania does in fact occur in Asia. The Asian tropics, where Prenolepis reaches highest species diversity, have been poorly collected, and as new collections are made, the discovery of Zatania in Asia would not be surprising. The main diagnostic features that separate Zatania and Prenolepis workers are found in the head and mesothorax. Prenolepis workers generally have a round head, with very indistinct posterolateral corners, whereas Zatania workers have a rectangular head, with more distinct posterolateral corners. The one exception is found in Z. gloriosa, which has a rectangular head, but also has very indistinct posterolateral corners. Prenolepis also always

have a mesothorax that is constricted immediately behind the pronotum. This condition is observed among the extant members of Zatania in Z. albimaculata, Z. gibberosa and Z. karstica (the fossil species Z. electra† also has constricted mesothorax). In these Zatania species, however, the eyes are small relative to the size of the head, and they are relatively flat, whereas in most Prenolepis the eyes are larger relative to the size of the head and distinctly convex. In species such as P. imparis, where the eyes are not distinctly convex, their head is still distinctly rounded, thereby placing it within Prenolepis (with other features noted in the previous paragraph).
The main difficulty in distinguishing between the various lineages within the Prenolepis genus-group at the morphological level arises from the fact that, in several groups, a similar morphological form is observed among workers, confounding the use of worker morphology as a basis for generic level recognition. An elongated worker mesosoma is present in Euprenolepis, Paratrechina and Prenolepis, as well as in the new genus described here. Accompanying this elongated mesosoma are elongated scapes and legs, and typically a distinct constriction of the mesosoma behind the pronotum. To a lesser degree, this suite of morphological traits is seen in a few species of Pseudolasius and Nylanderia as well. The reliance on worker-based taxonomy has hindered the discovery of this new lineage, and it remains a possibility that other lineages are currently undiscovered within the Prenolepis genus-group, based on the level of worker morphological convergence observed. Upon closer inspection, differences in worker morphology can usually be observed, but it is often difficult to ascertain their relative phylogenetic importance a priori. An example can be seen in separating Pseudolasius and Euprenolepis, as both are distinct lineages based on molecular data. With closer examination it was found that the mandalus of the mandible in each genus was different (LaPolla, 2009), but without the molecular phylogenetic results it would have been difficult to assess if this morphological difference represented a true synapomorphy for Euprenolepis.
The males of Zatania, however, do provide a series of diagnostic morphological features for the genus. A notable difference between males of P. imparis and Zatania is observed in the antennal scapes. Zatania males possess long scapes compared with the short scapes of P. imparis. Zatania males possess long, narrow parameres, digiti and cuspi that meet dorsally, digiti that are shorter than the aedeagal valves (in P. imparis the digiti are much longer than the aedeagal valves), and robust, distinctly shaped digiti (see Figs 28 and 38). These genitalic characters are putatively morphological synapomorphies for the genus. It is encouraging that male-based morphology provides a means to indentify some clades within the Prenolepis genus-group that are highly supported by our molecular data. The problem of course remains that for many species males are unknown. Zatania males are distinctive in several ways, the most obvious being their elongated scapes and legs, and the structure of the genitalia. It would be prudent for future morphologically based research of this genus-group to include males whenever possible.
Other studies have also illustrated the value of male characters to ant systematics. Wild (2007) gives an excellent example in which male characters provide critical information towards delimiting species-groups within Linepithema. Male morphology can also provide robust phylogenetic information in cases where taxa are known only from males (e.g. Aenictogiton; Brady & Ward, 2005). Recent efforts to construct comprehensive diagnoses (Bolton, 2003) and identification keys (see the summary in Yoshimura & Fisher, 2011) for males will also serve to increase the applicability of this character system. Unfortunately, in some ant groups, males are either too rare in collections (e.g. African ponerines; Bolton & Fisher, 2008) or are even undiscovered as yet (e.g. Lachnomyrmex; Feitosa & Branda ̃o, 2008), and thus cannot yet provide significant systematic information. An increase in targeted collecting activities and male-worker association via molecular diagnostics may increase the utility of male morphology in these cases (e.g. Fisher & Smith, 2008).
Our results support the notion that continued reliance on worker-based morphology may impede progress in higherlevel ant systematics. It is true that some groups previously established using worker morphology have maintained their integrity with the addition of new character systems, especially molecular data; the most notable example is the strong molecular support for the vast majority of ant subfamilies established using morphology (Brady et al., 2006; Moreau et al., 2006). However, molecular data are rapidly uncovering robust clades that worker-based characters have failed to identify. For example, molecular data (Ward & Brady, 2003; Brady et al., 2006; Moreau et al., 2006) consistently and robustly indicate a formicoid clade that includes several taxa previously identified as belonging to a separate group (the ponerines) by using worker characters. Ward (2011) summarizes examples of long-established ant genera that molecular data have revealed to be non-monophyletic. He outlines a new strategy in ant systematics consisting of the following steps: (i) the generation of a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis, with taxon sampling guided by existing taxonomic knowledge; (ii) the re-examination of morphology in light of any novel molecular results; (iii) the production of new morphology-based diagnoses. The current study, along with LaPolla et al. (2010a), provides two examples of how this newly emerging paradigm promises to increase our understanding of the systematics of ants and other insect groups.
