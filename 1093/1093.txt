Chromosomal rearrangements are proposed to promote genetic differentiation between chromosomally differentiated taxa and therefore promote speciation. Due to their remarkable karyotypic polymorphism, the shrews of the Sorex araneus group were used to investigate the impact of chromosomal rearrangements on gene .ow. Five intraspeci.c chromosomal hybrid zones char­acterized by different levels of karyotypic complexity were studied using 16 microsatellites markers. We observed low levels of genetic differentiation even in the hybrid zones with the highest karyotypic complexity. No evidence of restricted gene .ow between differently rearranged chromosomes was observed. Contrary to what was observed at the interspeci.c level, the effect of chromosomal rearrangements on gene .ow was undetectable within the S. araneus species.

The role of chromosomal rearrangements (such as Robertsonian [Rb] fusions and fissions, translocations, and inversions) in spe­ciation is much debated (e.g., White 1978; Coyne and Orr 2004). Two main categories of models were developed to explain how re­arrangements may promote genetic differentiation and therefore facilitate speciation (Ayala and Coluzzi 2005). First, the “hy­brid dysfunction” models suggest that changes in the karyotype (i.e., chromosome number, chromosomal morphology) can cause meiotic problems when heterozygous that will reduce the fertil­ity and the reproductive fitness of heterozygous hybrids (White 1978; King 1993). Second, the “recombination suppression” mod­els propose that recombination is reduced or suppressed in the vicinity of the rearrangement (Noor et al. 2001; Rieseberg 2001; Navarro and Barton 2003a,b). This reduction could favor spe­ciation by reducing gene exchange in the region of the rear­rangement, whereas gene flow in the rest of the genome is unre­stricted. Although recombination models were mainly developed thinking about inversions, they can also be applied to other cat­egories of rearrangements such as Rb fusions, which are known to reduce or suppress recombination in heterozygous Rb chromo­some pairs (Davisson and Akeson 1993; Haigis and Dove 2003). Although chromosomal speciation models have been addressed in a variety of taxa (see for reviews Ayala and Coluzzi 2005; Hoffman and Rieseberg 2008), the conclusions of these studies are often questionable (Noor and Bennet 2009; Faria and Navarro 2010). 
The shrews of the Sorex araneus group constitute a fascinat­ing model to study the impact of chromosomal rearrangements on gene flow. This group is characterized by extensive variation in the autosomal karyotype, mainly attributed to Rb fusions, and the chromosome arms are labeled from a to v according to a nomenclature defined by Searle et al. (1991). In particular, al­most 70 chromosomal races have been described in S. araneus sensu stricto (W´
ojcik et al. 2003). These races share three pairs of metacentrics (af , bc, and tu) and a sex chromosome trivalent (X,Y1,Y2) whereas the remaining chromosome arms can be dif­ferently rearranged among races. Thus, when comparing races, chromosomes can be similarly arranged, or rearranged differently into distinct metacentrics and acrocentrics (later designated “com­mon” or “rearranged” chromosomes, respectively see Fig. 1). 
Several hybrid zones between species or races have been de­scribed within the S. araneus group (Searle and W´ojcik 1998). The karyotypic complexity encountered in hybrids is expected to vary according to the level of differences between the two species or races involved. For example, the hybrids produced in some zones will carry only trivalents (i.e., simple heterozygotes) whereas hy­brids in others will carry long chain of up to 11 chromosomes (i.e., complex heterozygotes). In such situations, according to chromosomal speciation models, gene flow should be lower in situations with the highest chromosomal complexity and lower in the proximity of rearranged regions (Basset et al. 2006a; Yannic et al. 2009). Using microsatellite markers mapped at the chromo­some level, these predictions were empirically confirmed in two hybrid zones between S. araneus and S. antinorii (Bassetetal. 2006a; Yannic et al. 2009) and in pairwise comparisons between karyotypically distinct taxa with different levels of evolutionary divergence (Basset et al. 2008). Yet no study has compared the im­pact of chromosomal rearrangements on the gene flow in multiple intraspecific hybrid zones of S. araneus. Such comparisons would be of primary importance to further estimate the role of the rear­rangements in the genetic diversification of the S. araneus group. 
In this study, we investigated the impact of chromosomal re­arrangements on gene flow in five hybrid zones with increasing levels of karyotypic complexity due to different combinations of rearrangements. The impact of rearranged chromosomes might change according to the chromosome. Moreover, the position within chromosomes is likely an important factor because the re­combination rate varies along chromosomes (Borodin et al. 2008). Nevertheless, although both of these factors could add noise to our analyses and similarly to previous shrew studies (Basset et al. 2006a, 2008), we considered the rearranged chromosomes as a group. Our general predictions were thus, that if chromoso­mal rearrangements affect genetic isolation: (1) gene flow should be lower in the zones that present the most complex heterozygous karyotypes and (2) gene flow between rearranged chromosomes should be reduced compared to common chromosomes. 


Material and Methods 
SAMPLING AND HYBRID ZONES IDENTIFICATION 
Five European intraspecific hybrid zones of S. araneus were ana­lyzed in this study, for a total of 876 samples genotyped. Hybrid zones were named according to the two different races involved (Table 1). Samples were collected in the last decade and kary­otypes were obtained for all shrews (except some individuals from England). Each population was described as containing one or two races. 
Hybrid zones were characterized according to the meiotic configurations expected in the hybrids (see Fig. 1). The most simple hybrid zone was that with heterozygous individuals that showed only meiotic “trivalent” configurations (formed when the arms of three chromosomes pair during meiosis). The level of complexity increased when configurations involved a higher number of chromosomes (e.g., meiotic chain of five to 11 chro­mosomes in hybrids; see Fig. 1). 


DNA EXTRACTION AND MICROSATELLITE ANALYSIS 
DNA was acquired from previous samplings or was newly ex­tracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA),

following the manufacturer’s protocol. Sixteen microsatellite loci were chosen among those unambiguously mapped at the chromo­some level by Basset et al. (2006c), the letter in parentheses in­dicating their chromosome localization: L69(f ), B3(f ), D107(a), D112(a), L9(c), L68(b), C117(b), L13(de), C171(de), L57(de), L62(g), D24(jl), D106(h), L99(n), B30(o), D109(o). No infor­mation was available regarding the exact localization of the loci within a chromosome. Each locus was part of either the common or rearranged group depending on its chromosome localization and the hybrid zone under study (Table 1; Fig. 1). When the same metacentric was present in both races but polymorphic in at least one race, the corresponding loci were classified as rearranged. 
DNA was amplified according to protocols described in Wyt­tenbach et al. (1997); Balloux et al. (1998); Lugon-Moulin et al. (2000); and Basset et al. (2006a,b) in a final volume of 20 µl. One primer of each pair was labeled with a fluorescent dye on the 5. end. The amplified products were detected on an ABI 3100 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and allele sizes were analyzed using GeneMapper (Applied BioSys­tems) followed by manual proofreading. 

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
The following analyses were performed for each hybrid zone independently. 
Genetic variability 
Allele frequencies, allele numbers, observed heterozygosities (HO), expected heterozygosities within (HS), and between (HT) samples following Nei (1987) were calculated for each hybrid zone using FSTAT version 2.9.4 (updated from Goudet 1995). Heterozygote deficit within populations (FIS > 0) was tested using a permutation procedure (10,000 randomizations) to infer random mating. The exact G-test (Goudet et al. 1996), as implemented in FSTAT 2.9.4, was used to assess the significance of genetic differ­entiation. Comparison of number of alleles located on common or rearranged chromosomes in each hybrid zone was performed

GENETIC STRUCTURE OVER EACH HYBRID ZONE 
We analyzed genetic structure using estimates derived from F-statistics according to Weir and Cockerham (1984), using FSTAT version 2.9.4. Populations were then separated into single races according to their karyotype (i.e., populations sharing indi­viduals from the two races were divided into two populations of a single race and hybrids or individuals with unknown karyotypes were removed from the dataset) to assess structure within and between the different taxa. Differentiation of populations within taxa (intraracial, FSC) and between populations of the two taxa (interracial, FCT; Weir 1996) was obtained using the software package ARLEQUIN version 3.1 (Excoffier et al. 2005). 
Estimates of FST and hierarchical FSC and FCT were mea­sured across all loci but also across common and rearranged chro­mosomes using FSTAT and ARLEQUIN, respectively. Differences of genetic structure between common and rearranged chromosomes were tested by a permutation test. A distribution of difference between the two groups of chromosomes was generated by car­rying out of 10,000 permutations of microsatellite loci between the two groups and the observed difference was compared to this distribution. 
To test whether the interracial structure FCT was influenced by the degree of hybrid zone complexity CX or the type of chromo­somes CHR (i.e., common or rearranged), we compared several mixed models as follows: a null model (Model 1), with no effect of CHR and CX on FCT; the Model 2 tested the effect of CHR on FCT; the Model 3, the effects of CHR and CX on FCT; the Model 4, the effects of CHR in interaction with CX on FCT; and finally the Model 5 tested the effect of CX on FCT. Mixed models were performed using the nlme package in R (Pinheiro et al. 2011) and the five models were compared using a model selection proce­dure based on corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) as implemented in the AICcmodavg package in R (Mazerolle 2011). Analyses of variances were also used with R software to assess whether the effects tested by each model were significant.

GENETIC STRUCTURE OVER EACH HYBRID ZONE 
Low but highly significant FST values were obtained in each hy­brid zones (Table 2), suggesting a weak genetic structure. When estimating hierarchical F-statistics (FSC and FCT), we found sig­nificant FSC values that ranged from 0.013 to 0.036 (Table 2). Genetic structure between races (FCT) was weak and nonsignifi­cant in most hybrid zones (Table 2; Fig. 2). The detailed results of hierarchical F statistics are shown on Table S2. 
Values of FST estimated across rearranged or common chro­mosomes were highly significant (Table 2; P < 0.001). In some hybrid zones, the genetic structure estimated over rearranged and common chromosomes gave contrasting results but differences were never significant (Table 2). When measuring hierarchical

Discussion 
Our study of five karyotypic S. araneus hybrid zones exhibit­ing increasing levels of karyotypic complexity showed that these zones exhibit similarly low levels of gene flow even in the zones with the highest level of complexity. Moreover, no difference be­tween common and rearranged chromosomes could be detected in any of the zones. These results suggest that chromosomal rear­rangements do not have a strong impact on the structure of these zones and contrast with previous observations in the same group of shrews (Basset et al. 2006a; Yannic et al. 2009) and in various taxa such as sunflowers, flies, or house mice (e.g., Rieseberg et al. 1999; Machado et al. 2002; Franchini et al. 2010). Several nonexclusive factors could explain the differences between our results and theoretical expectations. 
First, although several studies in S. araneus showed levels of nondisjunction or germ cell death high enough to affect the fertility of heterozygotes (e.g., Jadwiszczak and Banaszek 2006), the data suggest that Rb heterozygotes do not suffer from infertil­ity as substantially as other taxa (Searle 1993; Narain and Fredga 1997; Banaszek et al. 2000) and that hybrid individuals forming long chain of chromosomes are not sterile (Jadwiszczak and Ba­naszek 2006). Thus, the impact of chromosomal rearrangements in S. araneus might be less important than in other taxa. 
Second, demographic, geographic, or historical factors might have a stronger effect than chromosomes in structuring the hybrid zones. In agreement with previous studies (Andersson et al. 2004; Jadwiszczak et al. 2006; Lundqvist et al. 2011; Moska et al. 2011), we observed a low genetic differentiation among chromosomal races of S. araneus. This low genetic differentiation might be explained by the recentness of chromosome differentiation, as karyotypic evolution was proposed to occur between 15,000 and 7000 years ago in the S. araneus group (Searle 1984; W´ojcik 1993). Moreover, chromosome differentiation was hypothesized to be a fast process (Andersson et al. 2005; Lundqvist et al. 2011), which could be largely independent of the genetic differentiations acquired in allopatry during the last glaciations (e.g., Taberlet et al. 1994). In addition, recent common ancestry from a shared glacial refugium may also explain a low genetic differentiation (Jadwiszczak et al. 2006; Lundqvist et al. 2011). 
Third, we considered in our study that the impact of re­arrangements would affect globally all the rearranged chromo­somes. This is a rough proxy and rearranged chromosomes are certainly not affected identically by rearrangements. However, a similar approximation had already been used at interspecific level (Basset et al. 2006a, 2008; Yannic et al. 2009) and the results of these studies confirmed the impact of chromosomal rearrange­ments on the S. araneus group differentiation. Additionally, Rb heterozygotes (i.e., the presence of a chromosomal arm in ei­ther the acrocentric or metacentric state within the same race) may occur in each karyotypic race (W´
ojcik et al. 2002). These heterokaryotypes may have a nonnegligible impact on gene ex­change by diluting or increasing the divergence between races. This effect might be strong in zones with high frequency of Rb polymorphism (i.e., Ox–He hybrid zone, Hatfield et al. 1992) but it could be neglected in other hybrid zones with very low frequency of polymorphism (i.e., Dn–Bi, W´
ojcik et al. 2002). 
Fourth, the Sorex genetic markers are only mapped at the chromosome level and no information is available about local­ization within a chromosome. The position within chromosomes might be an important parameter because the recombination rate varies along chromosomes and according to the chromosomal configuration (acrocentric vs. metacentric; Borodin et al. 2008). The impact of the position within rearranged chromosomes has for example been confirmed in several house mouse chromoso­mal hybrid zones (Panithanarak et al. 2004; Franchini et al. 2010). Finally, at the low genetic differentiation observed in these hybrid zones, it might be necessary to have a larger microsatellite reso­lution to detect a subtle impact of chromosomal rearrangements. 
In conclusion, and in contrast to what was observed at the interspecific level (i.e., Basset et al. 2006a; Yannic et al. 2009), our data did not confirm the impact of chromosomal rearrangements on the genetic differentiation between the karyotypic races of 
S. araneus. Although equating a low FST or FCT with extensive gene flow should be done with caution (e.g., see Holsinger and Weir 2009), the effect of chromosomal rearrangements might be negligible—or at least undetectable—within the genetically homogeneous S. araneus species. Further studies are necessary to understand the real impact of chromosomal rearrangements on the genetic differentiation of the group.
