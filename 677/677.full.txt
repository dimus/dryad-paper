Abstract
Insular populations have attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists because of their morphological and ecological peculiarities with respect to their mainland counterparts. Founder effects and genetic drift are known to distribute neutral genetic variability in these demes. However, elucidating whether these evolutionary forces have also shaped adaptive variation is crucial to evaluate the real impact of reduced genetic variation in small populations. Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are classical examples of evolutionarily relevant loci because of their well-known role in pathogen confrontation and clearance. In this study, we aim to disentangle the partial roles of genetic drift and natural selection in the spatial distribution of MHC variation in insular populations. To this end, we integrate the study of neutral (22 microsatellites and one mtDNA locus) and MHC class II variation in one mainland (Iberia) and two insular populations (Fuerteventura and Menorca) of the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus). Overall, the distribution of the frequencies of individual MHC alleles (n = 17 alleles from two class II B loci) does not significantly depart from neutral expectations, which indicates a prominent role for genetic drift over selection. However, our results point towards an interesting co-evolution of gene duplicates that maintains different pairs of divergent alleles in strong linkage disequilibrium on islands. We hypothesize that the co-evolution of genes may counteract the loss of genetic diversity in insular demes, maximize antigen recognition capabilities when gene diversity is reduced, and promote the co-segregation of the most efficient allele combinations to cope with local pathogen communities.

Introduction
Reduced and bottlenecked populations are exposed to the effects of genetic drift and loss of genetic diversity. Loss of genetic diversity may increase the risk of extinction of small populations because of inbreeding depression and decreased adaptive potential (Mills, 2007). Understanding the mechanism determining the levels

of genetic variation in reduced and fragmented populations is therefore essential for their conservation (Frankham 2002). Islands are a particular case of reduced and bottlenecked populations and they are especially vulnerable to the effects of genetic impoverishment (Pimm et al. 1988; Frankham 1995). This vulnerability as well as their phenotypic, genotypic and ecological particularities has promoted their study and conservation (Whittaker & Ferna ́ ndez-Palacios 2007). In addition, their relatively simple, discreet and finite character facilitates the study of evolutionary mechanisms and genetic

variability in these populations (Aguilar et al. 2004; Miller et al. 2010).
Traditionally, studies of population genetics in threatened populations have used presumably neutral genetic markers, such as mtDNA or microsatellites (Frankham 2002). However, patterns of neutral genetic variation do not necessarily correlate with those in functionally important genes (e.g., Aguilar et al. 2004). Hence, the parallel study of adaptive genetic variation and the mechanisms underlying such variation is recommended, in order to enhance our understanding of the repercussions of decreased genetic diversity in threatened populations (Hedrick 2000; Kohn et al. 2006). Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are among the best-studied functional genes in wild populations and constitute one of the most important components of the vertebrate immune system. They are involved in the triggering of adaptive immune responses by coding for cell-surface glycoproteins that bind and present foreign peptides (antigens) to CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (Klein 1986; Iwasaki & Medzhitov 2010). The recognition of foreign antigens bound to MHC molecules by T lymphocytes initiates a series of immune mechanisms that includes the production of specific antibodies and the destruction of pathogeninfected cells. MHC genes encompass the most polymorphic coding regions of vertebrate genomes (e.g., Robinson et al. 2005). This variation is thought to determine the capability of individuals to respond to continuously evolving pathogens and parasites, and consequently, MHC diversity has been traditionally associated with individual fitness and outcome of infection (reviewed by Oliver et al. 2009; Radwan et al. 2009; Spurgin & Richardson 2010).
Demographic processes, population structure, sexual selection and selective pressures imposed by pathogens are expected to drive the evolution of MHC genes of adaptive significance (Hedrick et al. 2002; Piertney & Oliver 2006). However, empirical studies comparing neutral and adaptive loci have not provided unequivocal results with regard to the relative roles of neutral evolutionary forces and natural selection. In some cases, balancing selection has been invoked to explain the maintenance of high levels of MHC diversity and lower inter-population differentiation in comparison with neutral markers (Aguilar et al. 2004; van Oosterhout et al. 2006; Mona et al. 2008). Other studies, on the contrary, have pointed towards a predominant role for genetic drift in the distribution of MHC variation (e.g., Miller & Lambert 2004a; Mainguy et al. 2007; Babik et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2010). Both simulated and empirical data also suggest that the loss of genetic diversity can occur faster when genetic drift and directional selection occur simultaneously in small and isolated demes (e.g.,
Ejsmond & Radwan 2009; Alcaide et al. 2010). Finally, the role of pathogen diversity and virulence in shaping genetic variation at evolutionarily relevant MHC genes has been stressed by other studies (e.g., Prugnolle et al. 2005; Dionne et al. 2007; Alcaide et al. 2010).
The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of neutral evolutionary forces and selection on the distribution of functional variation in reduced populations. For this purpose, we integrate neutral (microsatellites and mtDNA) and adaptive (MHC class II) genetic information in insular and continental populations of the globally threatened Egyptian vulture (N, percnopterus; Accipitridae). This vulture is one of the few large raptors able to colonize oceanic islands and included insular populations in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean and Arabic Seas, though many of them are now extinct (Levy 1996; Gangoso et al. 2006; Sara` et al. 2009). Despite its broad distribution range (Fig. 1), it is estimated that only 30 000–40 000 mature individuals survive in the entire world and the species is considered ‘Endangered’ (BirdLife International 2008). In the Western Palearctic, the Iberian Peninsula (Iberia) holds the bulk of the European population and the two main insular demes are located in Menorca (Balearic Islands) and Fuerteventura (Canary Islands) (Fig. 1). All of these populations are sharply declining (De Pablo 2002; Dona ́zar et al. 2002; BirdLife International 2008).
We specifically assessed which among the following hypotheses is better supported by our empirical data: (i) patterns of MHC variation cannot be discerned from those occurring at neutral markers (i.e., equivalent extent of genetic divergence and similar loss of variability at neutral and adaptive loci), thus indicating a predominant role of neutral forces over selection, (ii) balancing selection counteracts genetic drift, and therefore, both population differentiation and loss of genetic diversity at MHC loci has been minimized and (iii) population divergence at the MHC exceeds that observed at neutral markers and this finding supports diversifying selection.
Methods
Sampling and nucleic acid extraction
This study was carried out with samples from the main continental (Iberia) and the two relic insular populations (Menorca in the Balearics and Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands) in the Western Palearctic (Fig. 1). Blood samples were obtained from vultures captured at their nests or with cannon nets at supplementary feeding areas between 1995 and 2006 in Iberia from

northern (Navarre; n = 40 and Aragon; n = 19), central (Segovia; n = 15) and southern (Cadiz; n = 22) locations. Samples were taken between 1998 and 2009 in Fuerteventura (n = 236) and between 1998 and 2002 in Menorca (n = 36). DNA extracts were obtained following Sambrook et al. (1989).
Genotyping of microsatellite and mtDNA markers
Estimates of neutral genetic variation were based on the survey of five non-specific (Bv6, 9, 13, 14 and 20; Gautschi et al. 2000) and 17 species-specific microsatellite loci (Np38, 39, 51, 78, 93, 140, 141, 155, 163, 166, 229, 238, 244, 249, 257, 259, 296; Agudo et al. 2008) accomplished in a recent study published by the authors (Agudo et al. 2011). We used GENALEX version 6 (Peakall & Smouse 2006) to calculate parameters of genetic variability, and differences between populations were tested using Wilcoxon sign-rank tests. In addition, we sequenced 403 bp of the mitochondrial control region (domain I) using primers THR-F and FBox-R and following the conditions described in Roques et al. (2004). PCR amplicons were directly sequenced according to the BigDye 1.1 technology (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California). Labelled fragments were analysed using an ABI 3130xl automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). DNA sequences were edited using BioEdit (Hall 1999), and polymorphism statistics were generated with DNASP 5.0 (Librado & Rozas 2009). Sample
sizes used for each kind of marker are given in Table 1.
Major histocompatibility complex genotyping and molecular cloning
The second exon of MHC class II B genes was PCR amplified using the primers Acc2FC and Acc2RC according to Alcaide et al. (2007). We performed capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) analyses to resolve MHC class II genotypes (e.g., Bryja et al. 2005; Alcaide et al. 2010). Fluorescently labelled PCR products were diluted 1:10 and denatured using Hi-Di formamide, and heated at 95 °C for 3 min. SSCP analyses were run on an ABI 3130xl automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using a polymeric matrix composed of a 5% of non-denaturing Conformational Analysis Polymer (CAP) (Applied Biosystems), 10% glycerol and 1· Genetic Analyzer running buffer. Samples were run at 33 °C with 0.7 ll of GeneScan 500-LIZ size standard, using the FragmentAnalysis36_POP4 run module. SSCP electropherograms were analysed using GENMAPPER 3.7 (Applied Biosystems).
Eight birds from each population suspected to host different alleles were re-amplified using non-labelled primers and cloned into bacterial plasmids using the PGEM-T easy vector system II (Promega). We randomly sequenced 8–12 positive clones per individual to isolate MHC class II B alleles. Samples representing all unique

Tests of selection
Frequencies of non-synonymous (dN ) and synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions were calculated using the software MEGA 4.0 (Kumar et al. 2008). An excess of dN over dS (dN ⁄ dS = x > 1) provides evidence of historical positive selection. Tests were run independently for those codons supposedly involved and not involved in antigen recognition, according to the crystallographic structure of the human MHC class II molecule (Brown et al. 1993). Deviations from neutral expectations of molecular evolution were also tested through a Tajima’s D-test (Tajima 1989) using DNASP ver 5.0 (Librado & Rozas 2009) with a sliding window of 25 nucleotides and a step size of five nucleotides.
Positive selection at every codon was also tested using the HyPhy package (http://www.datamonkey. org, Pond & Frost 2005; Pond & Muse 2005). We ran the GARD module (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006) to subdivide our alignment into different partitions on the basis of significant evidence of recombination breakpoints, as recombination is known to seriously overestimate positive selection (Anisimova et al. 2003; Richman et al. 2003). We selected the Random Effects Likelihood model to infer site-by-site positive selection (Kosakovsky Pond & Frost 2005) considering only Bayes factors larger than 100 (i.e., those supporting decisive evidence of positive selection) obtained independently with different nucleotide substitution models.
As there was not clear clustering of alleles according to locus and there were evidences that the two gene duplicates may be sharing the same set of alleles (see Discussion below), we included all exon two sequences in the analysis of positive selection.
Estimates of population differentiation
First, we used the nucleotide sequence-based estimator of population genetic differentiation KST (Hudson et al. 1992) to investigate genetic divergence at MHC and mitochondrial loci (P-values were calculated by running 1000 iteration permutation tests) using DNASP 5.0 (Librado & Rozas 2009). Second, we calculated pairwise FST values at MHC loci and at mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci using DNASP 5.0 and FSTAT 2.9.3 (Goudet 1995) respectively. For the microsatellites, 95% confidence intervals were assessed by bootstrapping over loci. For the calculation of KST and FST for the MHC genes, we first calculated the allele frequencies by considering the sequence of a particular allele as many times as the inferred number of copies of that allele in a given individual (including the two gene copies). FST was estimated using ARLEQUIN 3.1 (Excoffier et al. 2005). After that and based on the presence of clear groups of

Mean nucleotide diversity per site (p) and the average number of nucleotide differences among alleles (k) are indicated for mitochondrial and MHC loci. For the later, the overall number of alleles (Na), the total number of different genotypes (Ng), the mean number of alleles per individual (Na ⁄ ind) and the total number of segregating sites (S) in the alignment are also shown. Microsatellite diversity is measured in terms of allele richness (AR) and average expected heterozygosity (HE).
SSCP profiles were directly sequenced as well. MHC allele sequences were assigned to particular SSCP peaks through the comparison of those SSCP electropherograms that apparently shared alleles. For every SSCP genotype, we carefully examined whether the overlap of DNA sequences of the inferred alleles matched the nature of the polymorphic sites detected across sequencing chromatograms. Allele sequences and direct sequencing chromatograms were edited in BioEdit (Hall 1999). Polymorphism statistics were generated with DNASP ver 5.0 (Librado & Rozas 2009). The phylogenetic relationships among MHC alleles were visualized through Neighbor-net networks built with SPLITSTREE 4.0 (Huson & Bryant 2006).
Finally, we investigated the MHC allele segregation patterns from parents to offspring in 33 families of Egyptian vultures (n = 236 individuals) sampled from the Canary Islands. Kinship relations were reconstructed according to field observations and molecular data (Agudo et al. 2011). The observation of allele inheritance allowed us to (i) obtain information regarding the overall number of loci co-amplified, (ii) test whether or not they are linked and (iii) evaluate the possibility of assigning alleles to particular loci.

linked alleles within the islands, we also calculated the FST-value at MHC genes between the two insular populations by using the frequencies of the different pairs of alleles in linkage disequilibrium (LD) (rather than individual alleles) using GENETIX 4.04 (Belkhir et al. 2004) (see Results). MHC FST-values that did not overlap within the 95% confidence intervals of those based on microsatellites were considered significantly different (Weir 1996). All individuals used for population differentiation analyses based on both neutral and adaptive loci were presumably unrelated. Given that our main goal was to analyse the differences between the continental and the insular populations and as we did not find evidence of partial structure within Iberia, analyses of population differentiation were performed considering all continental individuals as a single cluster.
Results
Genetic variation at microsatellite, mitochondrial and MHC loci
The genotyping of 22 microsatellite markers reported higher levels of expected heterozygosity (HE) and allele richness (AR) in the mainland (0.57 and 3.06) than in the two insular demes (Fuerteventura: HE = 0.44, AR = 2.44 and Menorca: HE = 0.53, AR = 2.59; Wilcoxon signrank tests between Iberia and: (i) Fuerteventura HE: Z = 2.46⁄P = 0.01, AR: Z = 2.13⁄P = 0.03 and (ii) Menorca HE: Z = 1.86⁄P = 0.06; AR: Z = 2.03⁄P = 0.04) (data taken from Agudo et al. 2011). The analysis of 403 bp of the mitochondrial control region revealed a ratio of 0.80 haplotypes per individual in Iberia, 0.57 in Menorca and 0.38 in Fuerteventura (Table 1).
Overall, we discriminated among 17 MHC class II alleles in the Egyptian vulture (Fig. 2, GenBank acces-
sion numbers EF370893 and JF313924-39). All alleles were independently found in at least two individuals except for two alleles (Nepe14 and 17) that were only detected in two continental birds. Polymorphism statistics across the MHC class II data set revealed 37 segregating (variable) sites corresponding to 40 mutations, a nucleotide diversity among alleles (p per site = 0.042) and 11.35 nucleotide differences, on average, between alleles (Table 1). All alleles differed by at least one nonsynonymous substitution, which suggests that they might also differ in their antigen-binding properties. The individual survey of MHC variability reported two, three or four different alleles per individual which is in agreement with the simultaneous amplification of two gene duplicates in the Egyptian vulture.
The Iberian population exhibited the highest degree of MHC variability. We found 17 alleles and 28 MHC class II genotypes across the 30 individuals screened. Eleven alleles were observed in the three studied Iberian subpopulations, and the most abundant allele (Nepe1) was so for these three sampled demes independently. Only low-frequent alleles (n = 6) were not found in the three demes, suggesting a random effect linked to the small sample sizes (n = 10). In agreement with the relatively weak genetic differentiation observed at nuclear markers among these subpopulations (FST < 0.03, Agudo et al. 2011), our data do not suggest a strong genetic structuring at the MHC either. As a result, we herein consider the Iberian Peninsula as a whole.
Only 10 class II alleles and nine genotypes were found in Fuerteventura (n = 236), and five of them (G1– G5, Figs 1 and S1, Supporting information) accounted for nearly the 90% of the genotypic variation in this population (Table 2). Likewise, only nine alleles and 11 class II genotypes were inferred in Menorca (n = 36)

of two alleles were assumed to have two copies of each allele. In the case of genotypes with three alleles, duplicated alleles were deduced by observing the linkage groups involved in that particular genotype (e.g., G5 and G6, Fig. S1, Supporting information).
In Menorca, two genotypes were composed of only two alleles: Nepe3+ Nepe6 and Nepe9+ Nepe6, respectively (Fig. S2, Supporting information) and were considered as linkage groups in this population. We also observed three additional linkage groups already reported in Fuerteventura (Nepe8–9, Nepe3–7 and Nepe3–5). Other linkage groups occurred at very low frequencies (Fig. S2, Supporting information).
Averaged value of genetic divergence was higher between linked alleles (9.16 ± 3.25 amino acid differences), than across random allele associations in Fuerteventura, even after discarding self-allele comparisons (7.6 ± 3.26). Differences were even more remarkable when considering the four linkage groups that constituted 90% of the genotypes (G1–G7; 11.0±1.63, see Fig. S1, Supporting information). A similar trend was also detected in Menorca, where the two main linkage groups (Nepe3 + 6 and Nepe9 + 6) exhibit 13 and nine different amino acid substitutions between alleles, respectively (Fig. S2, Supporting information).
In the case of Iberia, the comparably larger number of genotypes prevented us from inferring putative linkage groups with confidence. When calculating individual allele frequencies, we kept on considering that those genotypes constituted by two alleles should include two copies of each particular allele. Only six of the 30 continental birds displayed three alleles. Following the experience collected from examples such as G5 and G6 genotypes in Fuerteventura (Fig. S1, Supporting information), we assumed that the allele emitting more fluorescence was occurring in two copies.
Historical selection at the MHC
Non-synonymous substitutions were significantly more frequent than synonymous substitutions in those codons presumably comprising the antigen-binding sites (dN = 0.145 ± 0.055; dS = 0.043 ± 0.031, Z-test statistic P = 0.046), but not outside these regions (dN = 0.028 ± 0.010; dS = 0.011 ± 0.008, Z-test statistic P = 0.23). A slidingwindow Tajima’s D-test revealed three coding regions with significant and positive Tajima’s D values (Fig. 4). This indicates an excess of high-frequency segregating (variable) sites and supports the idea of balancing selection.

(Figs 1 and S2, Supporting information). Mean number of MHC alleles per individual was also higher in the continent (3.37) than in the islands (2.93 for Fuerteventura and 2.96 for Menorca, Table 1).
The absence of specific allele combinations in Fuerteventura, not only in the offspring but also across the entire population, indicated that the two MHC gene duplicates are necessarily linked (Table 3, Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the observed allele segregation patterns suggest the existence of different alleles within the linkage groups (Fig. 3b–d). This result rejected the possibility that the two duplicates could hold identical exon two alleles mapped to the same chromosome, as previously shown in pheasants (Wittzell et al. 1999).

lihood method revealed evidence of positive selection (all Bayes factors > 100) in 12 amino acid positions and negative selection in two codons of the alignment (Fig. 5).
Patterns of population differentiation
Estimates of population differentiation were in agreement with a pattern of isolation by distance with the highest differentiation between the two insular populations regardless of the type of marker analysed. The distribution of the pairwise differences in the MHC allele frequencies between the mainland and insular populations was similar to that observed at neutral loci (Fig. 6). Pairwise FST values at MHC loci based on the inferred allele frequencies fell within the 95% confidence intervals reported for microsatellites
(Table 4). Rates of allele fixation at the MHC were about four times slower than those observed for mitochondrial haplotypes, which is in agreement with the four times higher effective population size of nuclear MHC loci. However, when using the frequencies of linkage groups rather than individual allele frequencies to calculate the MHC FST value between the islands, we found that it was significantly larger (FST = 0.272) than that at microsatellite loci (FST = 0.138; Table 4). Finally, nucleotide-based estimators of population differentiation suggested a comparably slower fixation of variable sites at MHC loci than at mitochondrial sequences. The fact that mitochondrial KST values between the two insular populations exceeded by one order of magnitude those reported for the MHC is exemplary in this regard (Table 4).

  Discussion
This study integrates neutral and MHC variation to disentangle the partial role of neutral evolutionary forces and selection on the distribution of adaptive variation in bottlenecked and geographically isolated populations. Overall, our findings suggest a major role of genetic drift in shaping the spectrum and frequencies of MHC alleles across island populations of Egyptian vultures. However, the most intriguing result of the present study is the putative co-evolution of gene duplicates in the Egyptian vulture. We hypothesize that this evolutionary mechanism may counteract allele fixation, maximize antigen-recognition capabilities and promote the co-inheritance of selectively advantageous alleles in genetically depauperate populations.

   MHC variation and population differentiation
Our results indicate the existence of two MHC class II gene duplicates in the Egyptian vulture, as previously suggested by Alcaide et al. (2007) in this and other Accipitridae species. Compared with other scavengers, the MHC class II of Egyptian vultures seems less variable than that of vultures from the genus Gyps (Alcaide et al. 2007) but more variable than the MHC class II of An-

dean Condors (Vultur gryphus) (Alcaide et al. 2010). We must recall, however, that the 30 studied continental individuals may not hold all the alleles presented in as large population as Iberia, and therefore, we may be underestimating the genetic diversity present in the species. Furthermore, SSCP and direct sequencing analyses might have also failed in discriminating among sets of closely related alleles. Although we did not perform gene expression analyses, several lines of evidence sustain the functionality of the loci we investigated. First, we did not detect stop codons or frame shift mutations in any coding region. Second, we found significant support for positive selection acting on functionally relevant codons (Fig. 2), and an excess of highfrequency segregating (variable) sites (Fig. 4) supports historical balancing selection acting upon antigen-binding sites.
As expected, we observed lower levels of genetic diversity in insular demes than in their continental counterpart (Yuhki & O’Brien 1990; Hedrick 2000). Furthermore, comparative analysis of population structure between presumably neutral and MHC loci does not suggest the occurrence of balancing selection counteracting genetic drift (e.g., Aguilar et al. 2004; van Oosterhout et al. 2006) or local selection accelerating allele fixation (e.g., Ejsmond & Radwan 2009; Alcaide et al. 2010) in the studied insular populations, when considering the distribution of individual allele frequencies alone. Therefore, our results remain in the same line as some previous studies that underscored a prominent role for neutral evolution over selection in small, bottlenecked and isolated populations (Miller & Lambert 2004a,b; Mainguy et al. 2007; Babik et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2010).
However, when estimating the MHC FST value between the insular populations based on the frequencies of linkage groups, we observed higher differentiation than expected under neutrality. Even though this result may suggest the action of diversifying selection between the insular populations (Bernatchez & Landry 2003), we cannot rule out the potential contribution of population bottlenecks in the increase of LD between different alleles (McVean 2002). Nevertheless, these islands are located thousands of kilometres apart and are close to different continents and consequently, spatial variations in the pathogen communities must be expected (e.g., de Bellocq et al. 2002; Blanco et al. 2007; Alcaide et al. 2010). We therefore speculate that the strong differentiation in the composition of the dissimilar linkage groups might be the result, in part, of spatial variations in pathogen-mediated selective regimes (Prugnolle et al. 2005; Dionne et al. 2007; Alcaide et al. 2010).
We must also recall though that the comparison between MHC and mitochondrial and microsatellite
markers is probably not the most appropriate. High rates of back mutation and homoplasy are expected to underestimate population differentiation when using microsatellites. Selective sweeps, on the other hand, may increase genetic divergence at mitochondrial DNA sequences (Galtier et al. 2009). Therefore, the use of anonymous loci could be more enlightening in these kinds of studies (Lee et al. 2008).
Putative co-evolution of MHC gene duplicates
The observed pattern of MHC allele distribution could be the result of divergent alleles displayed by evolutionarily independent genes. However, the finding of linkage groups (e.g., Nepe8 + Nepe9; Figs S1 and S2, Supporting information) comprised by very similar alleles on islands (although at the lowest frequencies) and the impossibility of assigning alleles to loci (Fig. S3, Supporting information) reinforce concerted evolution, as previously reported within the Accipitridae family (Alcaide et al. 2007). In fact, cloning of MHC genomic fragments has revealed an identical intron 2 and exon 3 sequences across the two gene duplicates in Egyptian vultures (GenBank acc. numbers EF370964.1 and JF313939, M. Alcaide unpublished). Furthermore, it is well documented that allele shuffling between gene duplicates can be facilitated by their physical proximity in the genome (Ezawa et al. 2006). The sharing of the same battery of alleles between two MHC gene duplicates has already been described in the pheasant (Wittzell et al. 1999) and found in other species within the Accipitridae family such as the Black Kite (Milvus migrans) (L. Lo ́pez and M. Alcaide unpublished). Nevertheless, elucidating whether different alleles have become fixed at different loci in the islands or, if on the contrary, genes are sharing the same battery of alleles require future research. In fact, both scenarios may be consistent with the observed patterns of genetic inheritance in the Canarian Egyptian vultures (see Fig. S3C, D, Supporting information). The design of locus-specific primers or the sequencing of the 5¢-UTR region (Miller & Lambert 2004b; Worley et al. 2008) could provide conclusive evidence in this respect.
Even though we are aware of the putative influence of population bottlenecks on the observed LD patterns (McVean 2002), we hypothesize that our findings may be in agreement with the co-evolution of gene duplications into MHC haplotypes, as previously described by Kaufman et al. (1999) in the domestic chicken Gallus gallus. This theory suggests that selectively advantageous allele combinations can be kept together in the genome over long periods of time. Certainly, positive selection of linkage groups containing divergent alleles guarantees the possession of at least two alleles with

contrasting antigen-binding properties. In this regard, gene duplication would allow not only acquiring new functions (Dittman & Liberles 2010), but also counteracting the deleterious effects of genetic drift and promoting the co-inheritance of selectively advantageous alleles. This evolutionary mechanism would be especially beneficial in bottlenecked and decimated island populations.
Implications in conservation
Even though we herein speculate about the importance of gene co-evolution to maximize MHC variation in island populations, our results highlight a prominent role of genetic drift in the distribution of adaptive variation. As a result, insular and bottlenecked populations present significantly less MHC variability than their continental counterparts. This limitation might compromise their capabilities to confront novel infectious diseases (but see Acevedo-Whitehouse & Cunningham 2006; Radwan et al. 2009). In fact, previous research has already shown that island Egyptian vultures present lower immune response capabilities and higher susceptibility to infection than their continental equivalents (Gangoso et al. 2009). Scavenger raptors are particularly at risk (Blanco et al. 2007; Lemus et al. 2008; Lemus & Blanco 2009a). An alarming increase in pathogenic burdens in both continental and insular populations of these species has recently been described (Blanco et al. 2007; Lemus et al. 2008; Lemus & Blanco 2009a). This increase has been related to the sanitary regulations associated with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis (Tella 2001), the consequent congregation of vultures around carcasses of stabled animals and the massive ingestion of veterinary-prescribed drugs used in the raising of stabled animals (Blanco et al. 2009; Lemus & Blanco 2009b). Therefore, this alarming increase in pathogen exposure may have important consequences on the survival of insular populations with lower adaptive flexibility against invading pathogens over the long term.
