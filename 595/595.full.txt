Abstract
The current distribution of Bantu languages is commonly considered to be a consequence of a relatively recent population expansion (3–5 kya) in Central Western Africa. While there is a substantial consensus regarding the centre of origin of Bantu languages (the Benue River Valley, between South East Nigeria and Western Cameroon), the identification of the area from where the population expansion actually started, the relation between the processes leading to the spread of languages and peoples and the relevance of local migratory events remain controversial. In order to shed new light on these aspects, we studied Y chromosome variation in a broad dataset of populations encompassing Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and Congo. Our results evidence an evolutionary scenario which is more complex than had been previously thought, pointing to a marked differentiation of Cameroonian populations from the rest of the dataset. In fact, in contrast with the current view of Bantu speakers as a homogeneous group of populations, we observed an unexpectedly high level of interpopulation genetic heterogeneity and highlighted previously undetected diversity for lineages associated with the diffusion of Bantu languages (E1b1a (M2) subbranches). We also detected substantial differences in local demographic histories, which concord with the hypotheses regarding an early diffusion of Bantu languages into the forest area and a subsequent demographic expansion and migration towards eastern and western Africa.

Introduction
The term Bantu refers to a family of languages which is widespread in most of the sub-Saharan continent and is currently spoken by almost 220 million people (Marten 2006). Despite their adoption by populations which are settled in a very wide territory encompassing a large portion of the continent from the equatorial belt to Southern Africa, Bantu languages are characterized by a

high degree of similarity even among the most geographically distant communities (Greenberg 1955, 1972; Oliver 1966a). As a result of almost a century of linguistic and archaeological studies, the distribution of Bantu languages is thought to be the effect of a population expansion (commonly referred to as the Bantu expansion) which started from the Benue River Valley, between South East Nigeria and Western Cameroon (Johnston 1919; Bakel 1981; Vansina 1984, 1995). This is mainly supported by the fact that Bantoid languages, regarded as being ancestral to the Bantu ones, are presently spoken in this area (Greenberg 1949; Guthrie 1962;

Oliver 1966a; b; Lwanga-Lunyiigo 1976). A relatively recent population growth and colonization (􏰁3–5 kya) of new territories is still accepted today by most scholars as the most reasonable explanation for the geographical dispersal and relative homogeneity of Bantu languages (Schoenbrun 2001). It has also been proposed that the first steps of migration could have followed two main routes which have been defined as the ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ streams (Vansina 1984, 1995; Schoenbrun 2001). An alternative scenario was proposed by Guthrie (1962). While agreeing with Greenberg and others about the centre of origin of Bantu languages, he proposed the Katanga region, in the South of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the middle of the equatorial forest, as the area from where Bantu-speaking populations spread towards Western and Eastern Africa. However, some authors have highlighted the reductionism of these hypotheses based on a single huge population migration linked to the spread of languages, and have underlined the relevance of local migration processes (Lwanga-Lunyiigo 1976; Ehret 2001; Schoenbrun 2001).
Population genetic studies may clarify the dynamics underlying the present distribution of Bantu-speaking populations at both regional and sub-continental levels (Mitchell 2010; Scheinfeldt et al. 2010). Unilinear transmitted polymorphisms of the Y chromosome are particularly useful for this purpose, since they may be used either to draw phylogeographic inferences or to detect signatures of male driven demographic processes. As an additional advantage, the widespread practice of patrilocality among Bantu-speaking populations makes the distribution of paternal lineages less prone to the confounding effect of recent gene flow than maternal lineages (Hammer et al. 2001; Destro-Bisol et al. 2004; Wilder et al. 2004a,b; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009; Coia et al. 2009).
Despite its potential, Y chromosome variation has been scantily explored in sub-Saharan Africa and has been studied even less than the other unilinearly transmitted marker, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (Salas et al. 2002; Pakendorf & Stoneking 2005; Destro-Bisol et al. 2010). In fact, previous Y-chromosomal studies have been carried out on a local geographic scale or have investigated a limited number of geographically dispersed Bantu-speaking populations (Beleza et al. 2005; Coia et al. 2005; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009), and even the broadest datasets do not contain certain areas of primary importance to test the hypotheses concerning the Bantu expansion (Hammer et al. 2001; Underhill et al. 2001; Wood et al. 2005; De Filippo et al. 2011). Nonetheless, there is a substantial convergence concerning the hypothesis that specific paternal lineages, defined using single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs), could be a genetic legacy of the Bantu expansion. This fact is supported by their distribution and prevalence among Bantu speakers (Thomas et al. 2000; Underhill et al. 2000, 2001; Cruciani et al. 2002; Pereira et al. 2002; Beleza et al. 2005; Wood et al. 2005; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009) and by estimates of time of expansion, as in the case of haplogroups E1b1a7 (defined by M191) and E1b1a (defined by M2), which have been dated back to between 3.4 and 5.2 kya (Zhivotovsky et al. 2006; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009). In general, previous studies regarded the low level of variation occurring at Y-chromosome, and other genetic systems among Bantu-speaking populations as a signature of a recent population expansion (Bandelt et al. 1995; Alves-Silva et al. 2000; Jobling et al. 2004; Plaza et al. 2004; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009; Tishkoff et al. 2009). On the whole, previous genetic investigations have highlighted the agreement between the genetic structure of Bantuspeaking populations and some generic predictions of linguistic theories (Jobling et al. 2004; Zhivotovsky et al. 2004; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009). However, genetic studies should be more fruitfully considered as an independent tool to clarify anthropological issues and explore their complexity, since they may provide information that can be compared and, eventually, integrated with data and inferences from other disciplines.
Here, we present a study of Y chromosome variation in a broad dataset encompassing Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and Congo, focusing on the haplogroup E1b1a (M2) and its sub-branches, which are the most frequent lineages in sub-Saharan Africa. Populations sampled are either native groups settled in the area where Bantu expansion is thought to have originated or in the regions located in the putative origin of the Western stream. The analysis of paternal lineages was based on recently discovered SNPs (Wilder et al. 2004a; Sims et al. 2007; Karafet et al. 2008), which make our level of resolution higher than in previous studies on the genetic legacy of Bantu expansion (Jobling et al. 2004; Beleza et al. 2005; Wood et al. 2005; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009).
The availability of a large and tailored population dataset together with a more-in-depth dissection of genetic variation made it possible to perform an analysis of the relationships between genetic variation, geographical, and linguistic factors in the Bantu area. Furthermore, we used genetic data to draw demographic inferences on the peopling processes in Central Western Africa. Both these approaches disclose greater complexity than highlighted by previous research on the genetic legacy of the Bantu expansion, showing different genetic patterns among the populations under study and signatures of ancient demographic events.

Materials and methods
Population sampling and Y chromosome genotyping
The dataset consists of a total of 505 unrelated male individuals from 17 sub-Saharan African populations, including both unstudied populations from Nigeria and previously partially investigated groups from Cameroon, Gabon and Congo (Berniell-Lee et al. 2009; Coia et al. 2009; Fig. 1a; Table S1). Pairwise distances between sample collection sites (measured as air distances) range from 69.4 km for the nearest villages
(Gran Zambe` and Kouambo, Cameroon) to 1 320 km for the furthest villages (Idah in Nigeria and Ollebi in Congo).
An appropriate consent form was signed by each DNA donor. DNA extraction from a cheek swab or from blood was performed with a phenol ⁄ chloroform standard protocol (Gill et al. 1985) and extraction products were quantified with the QuantifilerÒ Human DNA Quantification Kit (Applied Biosystems).
Twenty Y chromosome SNPs were genotyped in a hierarchical manner with two different methods: a probe hybridization approach with TaqManÒ SNP

Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems) and a multiple single-base extension reaction approach with the SNaPshotÒ Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems). Loci analysed with TaqMan probes include M96(E), M2(E1b1a), M191(E1b1a7), M207(R), M17(R1a1), P116 (E1b1a7a3), 50f2P(B2b). The real time PCRs were performed with a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using program default conditions and adapting the number of cycles to probe performances, from a minimum of 40 to a maximum of 60. The rest of the SNPs were typed using the SNaPshot technique performing three multiplexes [first: M91(A), M60(B), M150(B2a); second: M75(E2), P2(E1b1), M215(E1b1b), M154(E1b1a4); third: U175(E1b1a8), U174 (E1b1a7a), U209 (E1b1a8a), P9.2(E1b1a7a1), P115 (E1b1a7a2), U290(E1b1a8a1)]. The first PCR step was performed with a QIAGEN Multiplex PCR kit.
Seventeen Y chromosome STRs were typed using the AmpF‘STRÒ YfilerÒ PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems) designed for loci: DYS456, DYS389I, DYS390, DYS389II, DYS458, DYS19, DYS385 a ⁄ b, DYS393, DYS391, DYS439, DYS635, DYS392, Y GATA H4, DYS437, DYS438, DYS448.
SNaPshot and Y-filer products were run in a 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems) and analysed with GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems) to assign individual genotypes. Derived alleles for loci M154, M215, P9.2 and M17 were not observed. Y chromosome haplogroup classification was based on Karafet et al. (2008).
Statistical analyses
A graphical representation of the geographical distribution of Y chromosome haplogroup frequencies was drawn with Surfer 8.0 software (Golden Software Products).
A phylogenetic reconstruction of haplotype relationships was inferred using the reduced median network algorithm, whose output was used to calculate the median joining vectors, using the Network Software 4.5 (Bandelt et al. 1995, 1999). The network was built introducing both SNP and STR data for each individual. A weight of 99 was assigned to all the SNPs, while the weight of each STR locus (ranging from 5 for DYS635 to 57 for DYS392) was calculated on the basis of its sample variance according to Meyer et al. (1999). Sixteen individuals with missing loci were excluded. Loci DYS385 a ⁄ b and DYS389II were excluded due to their phylogenetic uncertainty. In fact, loci DYS385 a ⁄ b are amplified together in the same fragment and cannot be electrophoretically separated, which makes a correct alignment impossible. Similarly, locus DYS389II is co-amplified with DYS389I and its size could be calculated only indi-
rectly, by subtracting the DYS389I allele (which is also amplified separately) from the total fragment (see Gusma ̃o et al. 2006 for details on forensic applications).
In order to describe intrapopulation diversity, we calculated haplotype and haplogroup frequencies, haplogroup and haplotype diversity, and mean number of pairwise differences (MNPD), using Arlequin 3.11 (Excoffier et al. 2005). The weighted intralineage mean pairwise (WIMP) values were obtained subdividing the dataset of each region into lineages and calculating the MNPD within each lineage. In this way, it is possible to estimate the weighted average of the mean pairwise differences among lineages, using the formula of weighted mean based on variance (Sokal & Rohlf 1995). The weighted interpopulation mean pairwise (WPMP) is the weighted average of the mean pairwise differences among populations of the same region, calculated on the basis of MNPD variance for each population.
Interpopulation genetic distances were obtained according to Slatkin (1995) for STR haplotypes (Rst). A graphical representation of genetic distance matrix was performed through SPSS 15.0 (SPSS for Windows, Rel. 11.2006. Chicago: SPSS Inc.) with a metric multidimensional scaling method.
In order to carry out a simultaneous exploration of diversity among populations and the relative weight of genetic variables, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) for SNP haplogroup frequency data with the R software package ade4 (Dray & Dufour 2007; R Development Core Team 2008).
To detect signals of population structure, a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was carried out grouping the populations according to both geographical and linguistic criteria, with Arlequin 3.11 software (Excoffier et al. 2005). Geographical groups were defined on the basis of political borders, with the exception of the only population from Congo which was included in the Gabonese dataset. Linguistic groups are based on Ethonologue linguistic classification (Lewis2009. Ethnologue: SIL International. Online version: http: ⁄ ⁄ www.ethnologue.com ⁄ ) and have been divided into four main categories: (i) Benue-Congo nor Bantoid neither Bantu (Idoma and Igala); (ii) BenueCongo Bantoid (Tiv and Bamileke); (iii) Benue-Congo Bantoid Bantu family A (Bakaka, Bassa, Ewondo, Ngoumba, Fang, Makina and Benga); (iv) Benue-Congo Bantoid Bantu family B (Duma, Kota, Ndumu, Nzebi and Bateke) (Table S1, Supporting information).
To investigate the potential relationship between geographic distances and genetic variation, a spatial principal component analysis (sPCA) was carried out for SNP haplogroup frequencies using the algorithm implemented in the R software package adegenet (Jombart 2008; Jombart et al. 2008; R Development Core Team
Ó 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

2008). Basically, the method explicitly summarizes the spatial autocorrelation calculated on a set of allelic frequencies using Moran’s index (Moran’s I), with information regarding the genetic variance among entities (individuals or populations) in order to detect the presence of spatial patterns. The spatial information used for the computation of Moran’s I is stored in a symmetrical binary matrix where populations or individuals are assigned as neighbours and non-neighbours, that is 1 or 0, respectively. In our case, the inverse matrix of pairwise distances was considered, where all populations are neighbours and the spatial information is converted into a matrix of weights which are proportional to inverse spatial distances. Differently from the conventional PCA, the independent components found by sPCA are both positive and negative, since they optimize the product between the genetic variance among entities and their spatial autocorrelation. The most informative components are the most positive (associated to positive spatial autocorrelation) and the most negative (associated to negative spatial autocorrelation), which contain the information about the global and the local structure of the sample, respectively. A global structure implies that each sampling location is genetically closer to neighbours than randomly chosen locations, as it happens with spatial groups, clines or intermediate states. Conversely, a stronger genetic differentiation among neighbours than among random pairs of entities characterizes the local structure. The component to take into consideration is the one with the absolute highest eigenvalue. To evaluate the consistency of the detected geographical structures versus a random spatial distribution of the observed genetic variance, a Monte-Carlo based test is applied (Jombart et al. 2008). This test simulates a random distribution of the genetic variability (H0 or null hypothesis) on the connection network and calculates a p-value depending on the dataset. The simulated distribution represents the correlation of the randomized genetic variables with the vectors of the Moran’s I predicting for the global or local structure. If the value associated to the observed pattern is higher than the p-value, it means that the spatial distribution of the genetic variance is not random and the null hypothesis can be rejected. We applied the test with 100 000 iterations.
The BATWING software was used to estimate the following demographic and evolutionary parameters: ancestral effective population size, time of the beginning of the population demographic expansion, and time to the most recent common ancestor (Wilson et al. 2003). The software is based on the coalescent theory and can test three different demographic models with a Bayesian approach: constant population size, growing population size, and constant population size followed
by demographic growth. The last one seems to be the most reasonable for populations that have undergone an agricultural revolution. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that this model is the most appropriate for African populations (Laval et al. 2010). Consequently, the whole data set was tested using the above-mentioned model. Since the BATWING coalescent model was not designed to take gene flow into account (Wilson et al. 2003), which is likely to be intensive among the populations analysed (Destro-Bisol et al. 2004), we decided not to estimate the time of the splitting of the populations. Prior distributions were established to cover a range of expectations which is concordant with human population history (Wilson et al. 2003). For the effective population size, a lognormal distribution (9, 1) was used, whereas for the alpha and beta priors, gamma distributions of (1, 200) and (0.5, 1), respectively, were used. To obtain the most reliable evaluation of the posterior mutation rate distribution, only 12 tetranucleotide loci (DYS456, DYS389I, DYS390, DYS458, DYS19, DYS393, DYS391, DYS439, DYS635, GATA_H4, DYS437, DYS438) were used, and a width gamma mutation prior distribution of (7 7500) was assigned to all STR loci, with a mean equal to 9.3 · 10-4, covering a range between 10-3 and 10-4 in accordance with the expected values of the Y chromosome STR mutation rate of both observed and effective estimates (see YHRD.ORG.3.0 database for a summary of the main publications about Y chromosome STRs mutation rates; Zhivotovsky et al. 2004). This prior distribution is wider than the ones used in previous studies which were based on meioses, where the variance is very narrow (Balaresque et al. 2010; Shi et al. 2010). SNP information was integrated for the phylogenetic reconstruction to discriminate possible STR haplotype homoplasies, but it was not considered for posterior estimates. Chain convergence was evaluated with three independent runs (starting from different seeds) using two different diagnostics implemented in the R package coda (Plummer et al. 2006; R Development Core Team 2009): the Gelman diagnostic (Gelman & Rubin 1992) and the Geweke diagnostic (Geweke 1992). Number of samples was 2 · 106 with treebetN = 10 and Nbetsamp = 20. The mode values of the posterior distributions were calculated through an R software package modeest (Poncet 2009; R Development Core Team 2009). To test the presence of genetic signatures of the ‘Western stream’ of the Bantu expansion, the demographic parameters were inferred in the two spatial groups of populations identified by the sPCA analysis (see Fig. 4c). Given the contrast between the sign of sPCA score for the Ndumu from Gabon (see Fig. 4c), although close to zero, and that of its neighbours, we repeated the analysis for both groups with and without this population.

Intrapopulation diversity of paternal lineages in Central Western Africa
The analysis of 20 Y chromosome biallelic markers has shown that Central African samples are characterized by the presence of several sub-branches within haplogroup E (M96). Haplogroups E1b1a7a* (U174), E1b1a8a (xE1b1a8a1) (U209), and E1b1a8a1 (U290) are the most frequent, accounting for 75% of our data set (Table 1 and Fig. 1A). Haplogroups A, B and R are also found at lower frequencies. As previously reported (Cruciani et al. 2002; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009), haplogroups B2a (M150) and R (xR1a) (M207) occur at frequencies from moderate to high in Central Africa (from 5.4% to 40%). The geographical haplogroup distribution is shown in Fig. 1A, and its interpolation in Fig. 1b. Since the sampling does not evenly cover the area, the readers should be aware that the representation is prone to over-interpretation. Nonetheless, we believe that these maps are a useful tool to visualize the phylogeographic patterns inferred from the data which is presently available. Within the haplogroup E (M96), the green component corresponding to E1b1a7a* (U174) is prevalent in Nigeria and Gabon (v2 = 18.33, 0.05 > P > 0.001), while the blue component representing E1b1a8a (U209) is significantly more frequent in Cameroon (v2 = 32.64, P < 0.001). It is worth noting that the sub-clade E1b1a7a3 (P116) was only detected in Gabon and in one population from Cameroon (Bassa), whereas E1b1a7a2 (P115) was only observed among Fang (both in light green, see Fig. 1B). A phylogenetic reconstruction for all the haplogroups is provided in Fig. S1 (Supporting information).
The intrapopulation haplogroup diversity indices range from 0.561 to 0.847 (Table 2), attaining values which are comparable to or slightly higher than those reported in previous studies (Beleza et al. 2005; Rosa et al. 2007), as is to be expected given the increased resolution of our SNP panel. Nigerian samples exhibit the lowest values of haplogroup diversity, which gradually increases in Cameroonian and Gabonese samples. Concerning Y chromosome STR haplotypes, the values of intra population haplotype diversity are greater than 97% in all populations with the exception of Bakaka and Ewondo, thus achieving in most cases the power of discrimination expected for forensic markers. The WIMP value for Nigeria (2.914) is markedly lower than the ones obtained for Cameroon and Gabon (4.264 and 4.219, respectively, Table 2). This result is due to the presence of a single predominant haplogroup (E1b1a7 (U174)) in Nigerians, suggesting a reduced variation in the ancestral population and limited gene flow from
other regions. However, the distributions of MNPD and WIMP values obtained for Nigeria are still partially overlapping. Furthermore, regional WPMP and MNPD values are similar in Gabon and Nigeria, whereas WPMP is lower in Cameroon due to the greater heterogeneity among populations in terms of haplogroup composition, although the difference from the MNPD value is not significant.
Interpopulation diversity of paternal lineages in Central Western Africa
The Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot of Rst genetic distances (Fig. 2) stresses the differentiation and heterogeneity of Cameroonian samples compared to the rest of populations. In contrast, no statistically significant genetic distance was observed between Nigerian and Gabonese populations (Table S2, Supporting information). This is particularly evident for the Bakaka, Ewondo and Ngoumba who behave as outliers. However, Nigerians and, to a lesser extent, Gabonese, group together. As expected on the basis of their common ethnic affiliation, no significant differentiation can be observed between Fang from Cameroon and Gabon (Table S2). The only Congolese population (Bateke) is close to groups from Gabon, reflecting their geographical proximity.
The differentiation among Cameroon populations and the relative homogeneity of Nigerians and Gabonese is confirmed by the PC plot (Fig. 3). The Nigerian populations are grouped together until the fifth component (data not shown), reflecting their marked similarity in haplogroup composition. Ngoumba are less distant from other populations than in the MDS plot, probably due to the fact that the haplogroup B, which is particularly frequent in this population, does not give a high contribution to the first two principal components (see loading scores, Fig. S2, Supporting information). Accordingly, their diversity from the rest of the dataset is better highlighted by the third and fourth PCs (data not shown). Conversely, the outlier position of the Ewondo is further stressed, due to the prevalence of E1b1a8a1(U290), which is the haplogroup that gives the highest contribution to the second PC (see loading scores, Fig. S2).
An AMOVA was performed to detect possible linguistic and ⁄ or geographical structuring of genetic variation (Table 3). A significant genetic heterogeneity was found when all populations were taken as a single group (8.17% for SNPs and 5.35% for STRs). The results obtained for each geographical group indicate that Cameroon is the main contributor to the observed heterogeneity, as predicted by PCA and genetic distances. This is confirmed when using a jacknife procedure, by

which we observed that the percentage of molecular variance explained at population level substantially decreases in Cameroon after excluding the Ngoumba population (from 10.50% to 4.18% P = 0.027 for SNPs; from 11.69% to 8.33% P < 0.001 for STRs). The removal of any other population does not lead to comparable reductions (data not shown). The AMOVA using the geographical classification (Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and Congo) shows significant variance among groups (5.90% for SNPs, 1.97% for STRs). In this latter case however, the proportion of variation due to differences among groups is lower than that found among populations within groups. The significant percentage of the
variance detected among populations within groups using both SNPs and STRs is due to the presence of Cameroonian populations, as shown by regional AMOVAs (Table 3). Conversely, no significant differentiation among groups of populations was found when populations were grouped according to their linguistic affiliation, even after removing the group including Idoma and Igala from the analysis, which is linguistically heterogeneous (data not shown). This suggests a lack of correlation between paternal lineage distribution and linguistic diversity.
In order to obtain further insights into the geographic distribution of the genetic diversity, a sPCA was performed using haplogroup frequencies (Jombart et al. 2008). The plots identify two groups of populations (Fig. 4), Nigeria, Bakaka and Bamileke from Cameroon on the one hand, and the remaining populations on the other, with the exception of Ndumu from South Gabon which shows a positive score (Fig. 4c). The strongest genetic differentiation is found at the border between these two geographic areas (as indicated by the increasing density of white lines in Fig. 4b). The highest eigenvalue obtained is the most positive one which is associated to the global structure. According to the test of significance, the geographical distribution of the genetic variability was found to be compatible with a random global structure, the P-value of the Monte-Carlo test being 0.156 and the observed value 0.119 (see Fig. 4d).
To infer demographic parameters, 16 individuals with missing data were excluded from the dataset (giving a total of 489 samples), while Bateke and populations from Gabon were pooled on the basis of their geographical closeness and lack of statistically significant genetic diversity. It should be noted that our demographic estimates are associated with wide and partially overlapping confidence intervals, a problem often encountered when applying Bayesian methods. However, the reliability of our results is supported by the convergence for the three runs we performed on each dataset and further strengthened by a previous study showing that the number of loci we used is sufficient to achieve correct point estimates, although the variance associated to the posterior distribution is high (Shi et al. 2010). The posterior mutation rate estimate agrees with the one reported by Zhivotovsky et al. (2004) (6.97 · 10-4; Fig. S3, Supporting information). A time since expansion of 􏰁8.0 kya for the whole dataset was obtained, with an initial effective size of 􏰁2800 individuals. Approximate mode, median and mean posterior values for the main parameters estimated are shown in Table 4. The same simulation was performed on the two sPCA groups of populations.

Group 1 corresponds to populations with a positive score in sPCA analysis, with the exception of Ndumu population from Gabon (see Methods and Results for further details). Group 2 includes populations presenting a negative score in sPCA analysis.
Bamileke point to a time since expansion of 10.55 kya, while the most likely effective population size was around 1800 individuals. A more recent time since expansion (6.10 kya) and an almost double effective population size (􏰁3 800) were obtained for the other group composed by all Gabonese and some Cameroon populations (Table 4, Fig. 5).
As a methodological choice, the Ndumu population was excluded from the analysis, due to the contrast between the sign of their sPCA score, although close to zero, and that of its neighbours. In fact, it seemed unlikely that a demographic expansion which occurred in the Bantoid region could have also involved this distant population. However, grouping them with the populations settled in the forest would have been in contrast with the use of sPCA as a method to define groups on which perform demographic inferences. It is anyway reassuring that even including Ndumu in the black (10.55 vs. 10.79) or in the white squared group (6.10 vs. 5.92 kya), the estimates of the time since expansion changed only slightly. Finally, to understand the demographic history of this population, we analysed it separately, obtaining a time since the expansion of 􏰁4.8 kya, in agreement with the trend shown by the forest region.
Discussion
A male perspective on the genetic structure of Bantu-speaking populations
As a contribution to the knowledge of the human prehistory of the African continent south of the Sahara desert, we surveyed a number of populations settled in a broad transect encompassing the area where the Bantu
expansion is supposed to have originated (Benue River Valley) and part of the western stream (Cameroon, Congo and Gabon). In order to better exploit the potential usefulness of Y-chromosomal polymorphisms for

the analysis of the evolutionary history of Bantu-speaking populations, we analysed both SNP and STR polymorphisms. The substantial agreement among the MDS using genetic distances, PCA based on haplogroup frequencies, and AMOVA carried out using the two types of polymorphisms indicates that our results provide an adequate and robust picture of Y-chromosomal diversity and there is no substantial ascertainment bias associated with the use of SNPs alone (Wilder et al. 2004a,b).
Our results do not show a clear relationship between genetic variation and linguistic diversity. This is well exemplified by the Nigerian populations, where the low heterogeneity among the three populations surveyed (as coherently shown by MDS, PC, AMOVA and WIMP ⁄ MNPD ratio) contrasts with their different languages, i.e. Bantoid, Yoruboid and Idomoid (see Table S1). At the same time, we observed a high level of genetic diversity among Cameroonian populations despite the fact they have a common linguistic affiliation (Bantu), the only exception being the Bamileke who speak a Bantoid language. This is consistent with previous regional studies on Y chromosome diversity carried out in sub-Saharan Africa or in other continents which failed to detect a robust correlation between genetic and linguistic distances (Lane et al. 2002; Coia et al. 2009; Mona et al. 2009; Veeramah et al. 2010). However, cases have been shown where linguistic affiliation proved to be a good predictor of genetic diversity both in Africa and elsewhere (Poloni et al. 1997; Hassan et al. 2008; Mirabal et al. 2009; Cruciani et al. 2010).
This study adds new information to the current knowledge of co-evolution between genetic and cultural traits in sub-Saharan populations. In fact, the increased level of resolution of the SNP panel used in this study highlights previously undetected variation within E1b1a (M2), the diagnostic haplogroup of Bantu-speaking populations (Jobling et al. 2004; Beleza et al. 2005; Wood et al. 2005; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009). In this way, we were able to detect some noteworthy differences within and among Bantu-speaking populations, mostly due to haplogroups E1b1a7a (U174), E1b1a8a (U209) and E1b1a8a1 (U290), which contribute to their high level of interpopulation differentiation and to the presence of distinct regional patterns of genetic variation. All these findings contradict the current view of Bantu speakers as a homogeneous group of populations whose gene pools are mostly if not exclusively the result of a relatively recent population expansion (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009). In fact, the strongest signal of diversity is given by Cameroonian populations. The presence of non-Bantu ethnic groups in this country raises the possibility that the diversity of Cameroonian populations from other Bantus could be the result
of differential admixture. However, such a scenario is in contrast with previous studies on Y-chromosome and nuclear loci which do not support occurrence of gene flow between the Bantu speakers of South Cameroon and the Afro-Asiatic and Adamawa populations from the northern part of the country (Coia et al. 2009; Tishkoff et al. 2009).
The lack of statistical support for the global structure observed in the sPCA indicates that genetic affinity is not consistently greater between neighbouring than distant populations. This is particularly evident for the populations settled to the South of the Cameroonian mountain range (Fig. 5), and could be the consequence of the low male mobility due to the patrilocal tradition. However, focusing on a narrower area, the same analysis suggests a genetic change in Central Cameroon, which approximately coincides with and could be related to the presence of high mountain ranges (Bamenda, Bamileke, and Mambilla highlands, or western highlands with a mean height of 2000 m; Fishpool & Evans 2001). Further population sampling and additional genetic information are needed to confirm this local pattern.
Demographic dynamics along the western stream of the Bantu expansion
In order to gain insights into the past demographic dynamics of the western stream of the Bantu expansion, we used a Bayesian coalescent approach. Our analysis differs from previous studies on Bantu-speaking populations in that we performed demographic inferences based on population data instead of single lineages (Zhivotovsky et al. 2004; Berniell-Lee et al. 2009). This choice was based on previous observations suggesting that the frequency of Y-haplogroups might vary substantially across generations due to fluctuations in the effective population size among lineages (Zhivotovsky et al. 2006). Such perturbations, which could be due to both stochastic and selective processes (Pritchard et al. 1999), could act as confounding factors for evolutionary inferences based on single lineages.
Our results point to a general pre-agricultural expansion time of 􏰁8.0 kya in Central ⁄ Western Africa. This is in accordance with previous studies on Y chromosome variation in sub-Saharan Africa which have detected signatures of pre-Neolithic expansions (Pritchard et al. 1999; Shi et al. 2010). However, some differences in time estimates can be found across datasets. Our data points to a more recent time frame (􏰁8.0 kya) compared to previous results obtained at a continental level (􏰁15.0 kya, Pritchard et al. 1999). This discrepancy could be explained by the presence in their dataset of populations such as Bantu farmers and hunter-gatherers, which
Ó 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

are known to have undergone an ancient separation and experienced different demographic histories (Excoffier & Schneider 1999; Patin et al. 2009; Batini et al. 2011). In this regard, it is worth underlining that we obtained considerable differences even in the local demographic histories of populations which are more closely related than those studied by Pritchard et al. (1999).
Concerning the hypotheses of the expansion of Bantu languages, linguistic and archaeological knowledge suggest the area between South East Nigeria and West Cameroon as the origin of the Bantu expansion with a time frame of 3–5 kya (Greenberg 1955, 1972; Oliver 1966a; Vansina 1984, 1995, 2006). However, our paternal lineage estimates show older signatures of demographic expansion. The results for populations from Nigeria and part of those from Cameroon, indeed, suggest that a population expansion occurred in the Bantoid area before the diffusion of Bantu languages (Fig. 5). Nonetheless, signatures of a more recent demographic expansion that could be related to the spread of Bantu languages were detected in the forest area. These results seem to provide support to the hypothesis of Guthrie (1962) and Oliver (1966b) who postulated an early diffusion of Bantu languages into the forest. According to these authors, such an event may have been followed by a demographic expansion and migration towards eastern and western directions. In any case, the Bantu language spread might not have been a direct consequence of a single huge population migration (LwangaLunyiigo 1976; Ehret 2001; Schoenbrun 2001), since population movements within sub-Saharan Africa were probably much more complex and stepwise during the last millennia.
In conclusion, the signatures we detected in the male gene pool of the populations of Western Central Africa depict an evolutionary scenario which is more complex than suggested or implied by previous research. Our study reveals so far undetected diversity for lineages associated to the Bantu expansion, while pointing to a high level of interpopulation genetic heterogeneity and highlighting substantial differences in demographic history from one region to another. Undoubtedly, most of the points discussed here require further investigations based on increased samplings and using additional genetic markers. Nonetheless, we hope that our study may represent a first step towards a better understanding of the complex genetic and demographic background behind the spread of the Bantu languages.
