Abstract
The Ethiopian highlands – home to striking species diversity and endemism – are bisected by the Rift Valley, a zone of tectonic divergence. Using molecular data we examined the evolutionary history of two co-distributed species of African clawed frog (Xenopus clivii and X. largeni) that are endemic to this region. Our field collections substantially extend the known distribution of X. largeni, a species formerly known from highlands southeast of the Rift, but that also occurs to the northwest. In both species, analysis of mitochondrial DNA and 19 autosomal loci identifies significant population structure, suggests little or no recent migration across the Rift Valley, and provides divergence time estimates across the Rift of 􏰁1–3.5 million years. These results indicate that the Ethiopian Rift Valley is a major obstacle to dispersal of highland-adapted amphibians.

Introduction
About half of Africa above 2000 m in elevation is in Ethiopia (Yalden 1983). Perhaps not surprisingly, species endemism in this country is also striking. As part of the Eastern Afromontane ecosystem, the Ethiopian highlands are considered a biodiversity hotspot (Mittermeier et al. 2004). These highlands include two Endemic Bird Areas (Stattersfield et al. 1998) and are home to numerous endemic species such as the Ethiopian wolf, the Mountain Nyala, and the Gelada. Of 􏰁63 amphibian species that occur in Ethiopia, about 40% are endemic and the majority of these are endemic to the highlands (Largen, 2001). Uplift of the Ethiopian highlands began about 20 Ma and continued until the end of the Pliocene, and is probably due to a massive mantle plume (Ebinger & Sleep 1998; Pik et al. 2003; Sepulchre et al. 2006). The ecology of these highlands is divided into the Afro-alpine region over 3200 m above sea level (m asl) and Afro-montane regions between 900 and 3200 m asl (Egziabher 1988).

The Great Rift Valley is a major geological spreading zone between multiple continental plates. The Rift runs south from Lebanon, under the Red Sea, through the Ethiopian highlands, splits into an Eastern and Western Rift just north of the equator, and then converges again and continues south into central Mozambique. The portion of the Great Rift Valley that bisects the central Ethiopian highlands is called the Main Ethiopian Rift, which is 􏰁1550–1700 m asl (Fig. 1). In southern Ethiopia the Main Ethiopian Rift intersects with the Eastern Rift in a ‘broadly rifted zone’ (Ebinger et al. 2000), which is somewhat lower (􏰁1250 m asl). Northeast of the Main Ethiopia Rift is the Afar Depression, a lowlying region (<1000 m asl) with desert scrubland ecology. Climate in the Main Rift Valley is generally hotter and drier than in the adjacent highlands. Pliocene and Pleistocene climate change associated with glacial and inter-glacial periods had a pronounced impact on regional ecology, with montane-adapted vegetation and associated fauna periodically being lower in elevation than the present (Flenley 1979; Leakey et al. 1996; WoldeGabriel et al. 2001; Sepulchre et al. 2006).

cal history of Ethiopia, we set out to test whether the Rift Valley is associated with significant population structure in these two frog species and to further characterize their evolutionary history. Based on their known distributions, these frog species appear to have different ecological specificities: X. clivii is known from a greater diversity of altitudes and a broader spectrum of habitat types. Despite this, these species do appear to have broadly similar ecological requirements (standing or slow moving water, wet conditions for overland dispersal) and they are known to co-occur in the same pond. Conceivably, past climate change and associated ecological oscillations could have affected the ranges and population structure of both species, but perhaps in different ways due to differences in ecological specificity. To further explore this, we sampled these species from widespread sites in Ethiopia, including many parts of their known ranges and also previously uncharacterized portions of their distributions. We collected sequence data from mitochondrial DNA and 19 autosomal genes and used phylogenetic and population genetic methods to test for population structure, and for evidence of ongoing migration across the Rift Valley.
Materials and methods
Fieldwork and molecular data
In September and October of 2008, X. clivii and X. largeni were collected by BJE. Xenopus clivii samples are composed of 41 individuals collected northwest of the Rift Valley and 21 from the southeast. X. largeni samples are composed of 19 individuals collected northwest of the Rift and six from the southeast, including the type locality (Fig. 1). Genetic samples are deposited at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University and morphological voucher specimens are deposited at the University of Addis Ababa.
Approximately 768 base pairs of nucleotide sequence were obtained from a portion of the 16S rDNA gene of the mitochondrial genome from 57 X. clivii and 24 X. largeni samples using 16sc and 16sd primers (Evans et al. 2004). Nineteen autosomal loci were sequenced from 10 – 58 X. clivii individuals and 16 – 24 X. largeni individuals, drawn almost entirely from the samples for which mitochondrial sequences were obtained, as detailed in Tables 1 and S1 (Supporting information). Amplifications were performed using primers detailed in Supporting information. X. clivii and X. largeni are tetraploid species and for some loci two paralogs were co-amplified in preliminary data collection. In order to obtain polymorphism data from individual genes, when possible we re-designed paralog-specific primers from

rainy periods, and are distributed over much of subSaharan Africa (Tinsley & Kobel 1996). Two Xenopus species occur in Ethiopia. Xenopus largeni is endemic to the Ethiopian highlands and, until now, was known from only two localities southeast of the Rift Valley (Fig. 1; Tinsley 1995; Tinsley et al. 1996; Largen 2001). Xenopus clivii is also found in the Ethiopian highlands but has a broader range that extends to Eritrea and possibly parts of Sudan and northern Kenya, although the latter two localities have not been confirmed by recent collections (Tinsley 1995). Both species are generally restricted to the Afro-montane region including, for X. clivii, two sites in the Main Rift Valley. X. clivii also is known from one location that is lower than the Afromontane region (Godare at 820 m asl; Tinsley 1995; Largen 2001). Neither species has been reported from the Afar Depression. Evolutionary relationships between X. clivii, X. largeni, and other Xenopus species are not fully resolved, although available information points to divergence of both species from other extant lineages of Xenopus a few dozen million years ago (Evans et al. 2004). Estimates based on a relaxed molecular clock suggest that divergence of X. clivii probably occurred before uplift of the Ethiopian highlands, and that divergence of X. largeni probably occurred during the uplift (Evans et al. 2004).

cloned sequences. If paralog-specific amplification was not possible for all individuals within a species, we did not include data in the analysis from that locus for that species.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences was performed using MrBayes version 3.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001) including representative sequences from all known species in the genus Xenopus, including those undescribed. A sequence from Silurana tropicalis was used as an outgroup. A model of evolution was selected by the Akaike Information Criterion with MrModelTest version 2 (Nylander 2004). Two Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs were performed with four chains per run, each for 10 million generations, with the temperature parameter set to 0.2. To assess convergence, post-run diagnostics were performed using R (R development core team 2005) and Tracer version 1.5 (Drummond & Rambaut 2007) including overlay plots of the posterior distribution of likelihoods and model parameters from independent chains, and calculation of the effective sample size of the post burn-in likelihoods and parameters. Based on these diagnostics a burn-in of one million generations was discarded.
Structure analysis
Population structure causes nonrandom associations between alleles of different loci (linkage disequilibrium) and an excess of homozygotes (Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium). We used an approach to evaluate population structure that has a general aim of minimizing linkage and Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium (Structure analysis; Pritchard et al. 2000) and an extension of this analysis where individuals are assigned to populations under a Dirichlet process prior (Structurama; Huelsenbeck & Andolfatto 2007). These approaches are appealing because they do not require a priori assignment of individuals to populations. We used Structure and Structurama to evaluate population structure in X. clivii and X. largeni using the autosomal data only. Mitochondrial DNA data were not included in these analyses because many slightly divergent haplotypes were recovered and also to make the results more comparable to the MIMAR analysis described below. Sequences were collected from samples from both sides of the Rift for all loci, but missing data from each locus ranged from 0–84% for X. clivii and 0–35% for X. largeni with a mean of 51% and 28% respectively. To explore the impact of missing data, we also re-analysed the data for X. clivii after discarding 12 individuals to bring the average missing data from each locus down to 33%.
For Structure and Structurama analysis, the phase of single nucleotide polymorphisms in autosomal DNA was inferred using Phase version 2.1.1 (Stephens et al. 2001; Stephens & Donnelly 2003) with the default settings including 100 iterations, a thinning interval of one, and a burn-in of 100. ‘Best guess’ estimates of unique alleles recovered from Phase summarize the posterior distribution of haplotypes by trying to minimize the number of differences between the guesses and the true haplotypes. These ‘best guess’ estimates were analysed using Structure version 2.3.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000) under the ‘admixture’ model, assuming no correlation between alleles, and using no prior information about sample localities. The ‘admixture’ model allows individuals to have mixed ancestry and is recommended for populations with the potential for genetic exchange and hybrid zones. Eight runs were performed for each value of K beginning with different random seeds, each for 200 000 generations, and with a burn-in of 10 000 generations discarded. The maximum likelihood of the eight runs is reported. Post-run inspection of the likelihood of the data and the value of the alpha parameter (the level of admixture) were stable, suggesting appropriate mixing of the Markov chain. For Structure, the algorithm calculates the likelihood of the data given a designated number of populations (K) and also estimates for each individual the posterior probability of membership in each of the K populations. A range of values of K are considered and, to evaluate support for alternative values of K, we followed the ad hoc suggestions of Pritchard et al. (2000).
Unlike Structure analysis, Structurama treats K as a random variable with a Dirichlet process prior (Huelsenbeck & Andolfatto 2007). The prior for the Dirichlet process has a clustering parameter (a) that influences the prior expectation for the number of populations. For each species, we performed Structurama analyses under the ‘no admixture’ model using a values from 1 to 5. For each value of a, two MCMC chains were run for 1 million generations with the heating parameter at the default value of 0.2 and 100 000 generations were discarded as burn-in. The ‘no admixture’ model assumes each individual is from only one of the K populations.
MIMAR analysis
In order to test for evidence of genetic exchange between populations on either side of the Rift, we fitted the data to two demographic models using the March 3, 2009 version of MIMAR (Becquet & Przeworski 2007). The null model (hereafter the ‘no migration’ model) is one in which a single ancestral population diverges into two descendant populations with no

subsequent gene flow between the descendant populations after divergence. The alternative model (hereafter the ‘migration’ model) permits ongoing gene flow between the descendant populations after divergence.
MIMAR is a Bayesian approach that uses MCMC to update model parameters (Becquet & Przeworski 2007). The models include polymorphism parameters for the ancestral and both descendant populations (hA, hNW, hSE; subscripts refer to the ancestral, northwest, and southeast populations), divergence time (s), and (for the migration model) the magnitude of gene flow in terms of effective number of migrants per generation in each direction (from the northwest population to the southeast population and vice versa). Instead of directly analysing sequence data, MIMAR uses four summary statistics (s1, s2, ss and sf) that are affected by the parameters of the model. These summary statistics describe the distribution among populations of derived mutations, including the number that are fixed in one population or the other (sf), the number that are polymorphic in one population but not the other (s1) or vice versa (s2), and the number that are polymorphic in both populations (ss) (Wakeley & Hey 1997). We considered only synonymous sites in this analysis. Mitochondrial DNA data (which included no synonymous sites) were therefore excluded, and the analysis was restricted to the data from 19 autosomal markers from each species.
Polarization of polymorphisms as ancestral or derived was achieved using the baseml program of PAML version 4.4 (Yang 1997) with S. tropicalis and another Xenopus species as an outgroup and the ingroups fitted to a star phylogeny following Foxe et al. (2009). A mutation rate scalar for each locus was based on divergence From the pipid frogs Hymenochirus curtipes and Pipa carvallhoi. The number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were estimated with PAML (Yang 1997) using a free ratio model and assuming phylogenetic relationships reported in Evans et al. (2004) among Rhinophrynus, Hymenochirus, Pipa, Xenopus, and Silurana. Assuming Hymenochirus diverged from Pipa 􏰁102 Ma as South America rifted from Africa (an average of estimates provided by Pitman III et al. 1993; Maisey 2000; McLoughlin2001;Sanmart ́ın&Ronquist2004;Serenoet al. 2004; Ali & Aitchison 2008) and a generation time of 1 year, we estimated a mutation rate (l) of 4.10 · 10)9 synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per generation. For MIMAR analysis, a variable rate of intralocus recombination was assumed to follow an exponential distribution with a mean of 0.6, in consideration of the findings of Becquet & Przeworski (2007) that error in the rate of recombination did not have a large impact provided some level of intralocus recombination was included. Lower and upper boundaries for parameter priors were adjusted so that the MCMC sampling
was not constrained, and command lines for MIMAR analysis which specify these priors are provided in Supporting information. Convergence and mixing of the Markov chain was evaluated for two independent runs with different random seeds by plotting the likelihood and parameter values versus generation of the chain.
For each species, the fit of the data to the ‘no migration’ and the ‘migration’ models was evaluated with goodness of fit tests (Becquet & Przeworski 2007). Simulations were performed with recombination using parameters estimated by each model, and goodness of fit assessed based on how often summary statistics from these simulations matched summary statistics from the observed data. The summary statistics are the four polymorphism statistics that were used in the MIMAR analysis, and also Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989), FST (calculated following Hudson et al. 1992), and nucleotide diversity (p) (Nei & Li 1979). We performed goodness of fit tests by drawing from the posterior distributions of the parameter values and also by using median parameter values from the posterior distribution as a point estimate.
IMa2 analysis
For comparative purposes, we also used the program IMa2 (Hey 2010) to estimate divergence times and to test for evidence of migration in X. clivii and X. largeni. Similar to MIMAR, IMa2 evaluates nested models with and without migration using a MCMC approach. In contrast to MIMAR, uses the entire data instead of summary statistics and assumes no recombination within loci. Also unlike MIMAR, IMa2 allows one to fit the data to demographic models with more than two descendant populations. However, because of concerns with over-parameterization given the size of our dataset (see program documentation) we restricted our analysis to models with only two descendant populations.
Prior to IMa2 analysis, we used the four gamete test as implemented in DNAsp version 5.10.1 (Rozas et al. 2003) to test for recombination within each locus. Evidence of recombination was detected in four loci of X. largeni and eight loci in X. clivii; these were deleted from IMa2 analysis. We also calculated Tajima’s D, Fu and Li’s D, and Fu and Li’s F*, also with DNAsp, in order to test for evidence of non-neutral evolution. No X. largeni loci showed significant evidence of natural selection. However, after deleting the loci with evidence of recombination, four additional loci in X. clivii had evidence of non-neutral evolution based on at least one of these tests. We therefore performed two separate IMa2 analyses for X. clivii, one including and one not including these four loci.
For intronic data we used the same mutation rate per site as the MIMAR analysis and converted this to a mutation rate per locus by multiplying by the number
Ó 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

of sites sequenced at each locus. For exonic data we used the same 113 autosomal loci dataset from Bewick et al. (Bewick AJ, Chain FJJ, Heled J, Evans BJ unpublished data) to estimate the mutation rate across nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, and arrived at a value of 1.1 · 10)9 substitutions per site per generation; this was also converted to a rate per gene in the same way as the introns. We excluded the mitochondrial DNA loci to make the results of this analysis more comparable to the MIMAR results.
For IMa2 analysis, three separate MCMC analyses were performed for each species, each starting with a different random seed, for 10 000 000 generations, and saving genealogies every 100 generations after discarding a burn-in of 300 000 generations. Forty chains per analysis were run using settings for ‘medium heating’ for a medium sized dataset as suggested in the program documentation. We considered a uniform and an exponential prior for migration. The uniform prior for migration was set to a maximum of 0.7 for X. largeni and 0.8 for X. clivii and the exponential prior for migration was set to have a mean of 1 for both species, given our expectations based on the low or absent level of migration inferred from MIMAR analysis (see below). Results from both migration priors were similar and those from the uniform prior are reported here. The prior for theta was uniform and based on preliminary runs was set to a maximum of 15 and 21 for X. largeni and for X. clivii, respectively. The prior for divergence time was also uniform and set to a maximum of 6 and 12 for X. largeni and for X. clivii, respectively. The infinite sites model was assumed when possible except for six loci in X. largeni, which required the use of the HKY model due to multiple substitutions at a single position. Convergence and mixing of the Markov chain was evaluated by plotting the likelihood and parameter values versus generation of the chain. Support for ongoing migration after divergence was evaluated using the likelihood ratio test statistic as described by Nielsen & Wakeley (2001) and using a mixture of chi square distributions for tests with boundary conditions as described by Goldman & Whelan (2000).
For this analysis, a MCMC simulation was run with asymmetric migration between the descendant populations in ‘M mode’. Following this, nested models without migration between one or both descendant populations were evaluated in ‘L mode’ (see program documentation for details). Commands used in IMa2 are provided in Supporting information.
Morphological analyses and museum specimens
As a descriptive exercise aimed at further characterizing morphological divergence on either side of the Rift, 12
external measurements were taken from X. clivii on 12 adult females (seven from the northwest and five from the southeast) and 13 adult males (five from the northwest and eight from the southeast) following Tinsley (1973). Eleven of these measurements were standardized by dividing by the snout-vent length. The data were then transformed so that each measurement had a mean of zero and a variance of one, and then subjected to principal components analysis using R (R development core team 2005). All X. largeni specimens collected northwest of the Rift were either tadpoles or newly metamorphosed froglets, so adult morphology of this species was not analysed.
To provide data on geographical distribution and morphological variation in Ethiopian Xenopus species, preserved collections were examined in the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH), Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard (MCZ), Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago (FMNH), California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco (CAS), Natural History Museum, London (BM), Museo Zoologico dell’ Universita`, Florence (MZUF), the United States National Museum of Natural History, Washington (USNM), and Muse ́ um National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris (MNHN).

Distributions of X. clivii and X. largeni
Detailed maps of the distribution of X. clivii and X. largeni based on museum specimens are provided in Largen (2001) and Tinsley et al. (1996). Despite a relatively extensive representation of Xenopus species from other areas of Africa, most of the museum collections studied contained few records from Ethiopia. For example, for six of the institutions (AMNH, MCZ, FMNH, CAS, USNM and MNHN), the combined total of X. clivii was only 12 specimens. For all except two of these, localities specified were in the area of Addis Ababa. Collections from Ethiopia in MZUF were also from this region. BM collections provided more comprehensive documentation (see Largen 2001), but again predominantly from the Addis Ababa environs. Although X. clivii was originally described from Eritrea, Largen (2001) reported only two localities within Ethiopia (Adua and Gorgora) that were substantially north of Addis Ababa, underscoring the paucity of collections from this region. There are two records of X. clivii from the floor of the Rift Valley: Lake Langano, 1585 m asl (BM 1969.973) and Lake Zwai, 1650 m asl (MCZ 51 457). Our fieldwork provided a series of new localities for X. clivii in the highlands Northwest of the Rift (Fig. 1 and Supporting information).

All published records of X. largeni are from the mountains east and south-east of the Rift Valley (BM collections listed in Tinsley 1995; Largen 2001). Our museum studies identified previously unpublished specimens from the area in which the paratypes were collected (AMNH A–158387-158389; details in Supporting information). Our field studies included collections of X. largeni from the type locality but not the other previously known locality, which is a stream in the Arussi (Arsi) Mountains at 􏰁2500 m asl (Fig. S1, Supporting information; Tinsley 1995; Tinsley et al. 1996; Largen 2001). Additionally, the present field collections substantially extend the known range of X. largeni to include areas northwest of the Rift Valley including two localities north of Mount Choke but south of Lake Tana, and a third locality north of Lake Tana but south of the Simien Mountains (Fig. 1).
Significant molecular differentiation across the Rift Valley
Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of X. clivii and X. largeni are reciprocally monophyletic and diverged on either side of the Rift Valley; in both species no unique mitochondrial DNA haplotype was found on both sides of the Rift Valley (Fig. 2). The level of divergence between intraspecific clades in both species is comparable to that seen between some sister species (for example between X. vestitus + X. lenduensis or between X. wittei + X. itombwensis) and similar to that observed within X. laevis (sensu Kobel et al. 1996), a clade considered by some to include multiple species (Frost 2010).
In X. clivii, mitochondrial lineages are geographically structured on each side of the Rift. Two lineages from the southeast are each restricted to different locations. In the northwest one lineage was observed only in the south and two others were observed only in the north, with one locality (Korata) having both mitochondrial lineages in different individuals from the same pond. Little or no sequence divergence was observed between X. clivii mitochondrial DNA haplotypes on either side of major rivers such as the Omo, Blue Nile, and Takeze ́. In X. largeni, little molecular variation was observed in mitochondrial DNA within the northwest population or within the southeast population.
Structure analysis of autosomal DNA supported four differentiated populations in X. clivii and three in X. largeni. The four populations of X. clivii comprise two northwest of the Rift and two southeast of the Rift. That the main division in both species corresponds to the Rift Valley is evinced by Structure analysis with K = 2 (Fig. 3). In X. clivii, further division between two northwest populations corresponded with the precipitous Blue Nile Valley south of Mt. Choke (Fig. 1), even
though differentiation in mitochondrial DNA was fairly low across this valley. Differentiation between the two southeast populations of X. clivii was somewhere between the two southeast sampling localities (the Harena forest and a southern portion of the southeast highlands; Fig. 1). Structurama analysis also recovered support for four populations in X. clivii (Table 2), with two exceptions. The first was when the Dirichlet process prior had a mean of 1, in which case Structurama supported a separate population for each individual in the analysis (K = 57). The other exception was when the Dirichlet process prior had a mean of five, in which case there was slightly higher posterior probability for

five than four populations (Table 2). Results from re-analysis of the reduced X. clivii dataset with less missing data were qualitatively identical to the analysis of the full dataset; support for four populations was somewhat weaker in Structure analysis (Fig. 3) but stronger in Structurama analysis (Table 2).
In X. largeni, Structure and Structurama analysis both supported the presence of three populations with the most substantial differentiation being between samples collected northwest and southeast of the Rift Valley (Table 2, Fig. 3). Population subdivision is presumably related to the Rift Valley although the gap in sampling prevents us from dismissing the Blue Nile Valley south of Mt. Choke (Fig. 1) as an additional contributor to differentiation. Five individuals sampled in Ayen Birhan (Fig. 1, Table S1, Supporting information) appear significantly differentiated from other populations from the northwest according to both analyses (Table 2, Fig. 3). FST between populations northwest and southeast of the Rift was 􏰁 0.6 for X. clivii and X. largeni (Table 3).
Using MIMAR, we fitted molecular polymorphism data from 19 autosomal loci to models with and without migration across the Rift Valley. In general for both species the data failed to reject the ‘no migration’ model. In X. largeni, both models provided reasonable fits for all summary statistics, suggesting that the addi-
tion of migration parameters was not necessary. More specifically, for this species, the observed values fell within the 95% confidence limits of the simulated values generated in the goodness of fit tests (Table 3). In X. clivii, neither the ‘migration’ nor the ‘no migration’ model provided a good fit for FST or Tajima’s D when a point estimate of parameters was used in the goodness of fit simulations (Table 3). When simulations were performed by drawing from the posterior distribution, Tajima’s D of the northwest population provided a significantly poorer fit for the ‘migration’ model but not for the ‘no migration’ model (Table 3). In both species the posterior distributions for migration parameters are near zero for both directions of migration (Fig. 4 and Table 4).
Confidence intervals for the times of divergence in each species overlap, although the mean estimate is more recent for X. largeni (􏰁800 000 years ago) than X. clivii (􏰁1 200 000 years ago) (Table 4). Both species appear to have a larger effective population size northwest of the Rift compared to southeast, although confidence intervals for this parameter estimate from each region overlap. Dividing the values for hNW and hSE in Table 4 by 4 l provides an estimate of the northwest and southeast population sizes for X. clivii of roughly 300 000 and 200 000 individuals respectively, and for

                                       Fig. 3 Structure analysis of autosomal loci supports four differentiated populations in X. clivii and three in X. largeni. Nineteen autosomal loci are analysed for each species. The likelihoods (-lnL) of five or four populations (K) were considered for X. clivii and X. largeni, respectively, and an approximation of the probability of each number of populations given the data (Pr(K|X)) calculated with the ad hoc method of Pritchard et al. (2000), and contingent on the associated simplifying assumptions discussed therein. For each value of K, the posterior probability of each individual being a member of each population is graphed for each individual analysed. A total of 57 individuals were analysed for X. clivii and 23 individuals for X. largeni; the number of samples from different parts of Ethiopia is indicated below the graphs for each species. For X. clivii, results from analysis of the reduced dataset follow a slash.

of 1 000 000 and 1 100 000 individuals for X. clivii and X. largeni, respectively.
We also fitted the data to the migration and no migration model using the program IMa2. For this analysis, we had to exclude loci from both species (4 and 8– 12 loci, respectively, for X. largeni and X. clivii) due to evidence of recombination and natural selection. There are both consistencies and differences between results of IMa2 and MIMAR analysis. The most prominent difference is that IMa2 supported the ‘migration’ model over the ‘no migration’ model for both species. We inferred this using two likelihood ratio tests. The first (IMa2 Test 1) compares a model with an asymmetrical rate of migration to one with a symmetrical rate of migration, and the second (IMa2 Test 2), compares the model with a symmetrical rate of migration to a model with no migration. Both of these tests favoured the more parameterized model for both species (IMa2 Test 1, P = 0.040 and 0.009 for X. clivii and X. largeni, respectively; IMa2 Test 2: P < 0.001 for X. clivii and for X. largeni). Despite this difference, MIMAR and IMa2 analyses were consistent in the sense that both inferred a very low (or non-existent) level of migration across the Rift, with the exception of X. clivii migration from the northwest to the southeast population that was inferred by IMa2 (Fig. S1, Supporting information).
Another difference is that IMa2 analysis suggests that the divergence times across the Rift are much older for both species than the MIMAR estimates. The mean IMa2 divergence estimate for X. clivii is 3 588 920 years ago and for X. largeni is 2 508 678 years ago (95% high-

 est posterior density (HPD) intervals are not reported because it did not appear contiguous; Fig. S1, Supporting information). However, MIMAR and IMa2 both suggest that X. clivii divergence across the Rift is somewhat older than X. largeni.
MIMAR and IMa2 analyses are also similar in that both suggest that population size is higher northwest of the Rift compared to southeast of the Rift in both species, and that ancestral population sizes were much larger than the descendant populations. The mean IMa2 estimates of population size northwest and southeast of
the Rift was 213 242 (HPD interval: 99 730–331 102) and 165 847 (HPD interval: 75 794–275 254) respectively for X. clivii and 262 875 (HPD interval: 149 012–383 626) and 71 257 (HPD interval: 22 193–142 671), respectively, for X. largeni. The mean IMa2 estimate of ancestral population size for X. clivii was 2 300 531 (HPD interval not reported because it did not reach low levels at the upper limit) and for X. largeni was 772 271 (HPD interval: 0–2 850 249). Thus the magnitude of the effective population size estimates are fairly similar for MIMAR and IMa2. Results of the IMa2 analysis of the smaller

    dataset for X. clivii that excluded loci with evidence of natural selection were similar to the analysis of the larger X. clivii dataset in that the symmetrical migration model was favoured over the no migration model (IMa2 Test 2, P < 0.001), with the exception that the model with asymmetrical migration was not significantly favoured over the model with symmetrical migration (IMa2 Test 1, P = 0.134).
Morphological variation in X. clivii
Raw morphological data for X. clivii are available in Table S2 (Supporting information). Size of female X. clivii did not differ significantly on either side of the Rift (P = 0.921, Students t-test, n = 12) but adult males were significantly smaller in the northwest (P = 0.001, n = 13). However, principal components analysis of size-transformed data does not provide strong evidence of morphological differentiation in either sex. The first and second principal components of each population, for example, overlap extensively (Fig. 5) and similar results were obtained by comparing the first and third or the second and third principal components.
Discussion
We report here results of an evolutionary analysis of two sympatric species of frog endemic to the Ethiopian highlands, X. clivii and X. largeni. Our field collections substantially extend the known distribution of X. largeni (Tinsley 1995; Tinsley et al. 1996; Largen 2001) to include portions of the Ethiopian highlands northwest of the Rift Valley. We also provide records of X. clivii from new localities northwest of the Rift. Population assignment algorithms (Structure and Structurama) suggest the existence of four and three populations in
X. clivii and X. largeni, respectively, with both species exhibiting high population differentiation across the Rift Valley. Coalescent analyses of polymorphism data from up to 19 autosomal loci (MIMAR and IMa2) suggests that recent migration across the Rift Valley in both species is very low or absent and that divergence between populations on either side is 􏰁1–3.5 million years. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences suggests reciprocal monophyly on either side of the Rift in both species, which is also consistent with the hypothesis of little or no gene flow across the Rift.
Within X. clivii and X. largeni, divergence of intraspecific mitochondrial DNA clades across the Rift is similar in magnitude to that seen between some sister species. However, at this time we do not view these results as warranting taxonomic revision for multiple reasons. One reason for not proposing separate species status for populations on either side of the Rift Valley is that marked morphological differences between X. clivii populations were not revealed by principal components analysis, and it is conceivable that significantly smaller male X. clivii from the northwest population stems from subadults in our small sample. Second, with respect to results from MIMAR analysis, failure to reject a null hypothesis of no migration is not proof that this null hypothesis is true, particularly because gene flow that occurs ephemerally after divergence tends to go undetected by MIMAR analysis (Becquet & Przeworski 2009). Additionally, the model with migration was not rejected by IMa2 analysis, although this analysis did suggest a very low level of migration except from the northwest to the southeast population of X. clivii when the larger dataset was analysed. Thus the different methodology of MIMAR and IMa2 or the different portions of the data analysed by these methods led to somewhat different inferences concerning the magnitude of migration between populations. These discrepancies probably are related to the substantial differences in the data analysed (only silent sites for 19 loci for MIMAR but nonsynonymous, synonymous, and other putatively silent sites for a subset of these loci for IMa2), and also the substantial differences in how the data are analysed in by each program (use of summary statistics and accommodating recombination for MIMAR versus using the sequence data directly and disallowing recombination for IMa2).
Intraspecific divergence estimates provided by MIMAR and IMa2 also were quite different, with the IMa2 estimate being roughly 3-fold older (Fig. 3, Fig. S1, Supporting information). A major caveat to divergence estimates from both of these analyses is that they rely on assumptions that are undoubtedly inaccurate. The mutation rates used in this study were based on (i) the estimated time of the separation of South America and
Ó 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

Africa, (ii) an assumption that this geological event triggered divergence of Pipa and Hymenochirus, and (iii) an assumption that the generation time of pipid frogs is 1 year. Because they ignore the presence of ancestral polymorphism in the most recent common ancestor of Pipa and Hymenochirus, the mutation rates used here could be too high, which would lead to an underestimated time of divergence. For IMa2 analysis we used different mutation rates for protein coding regions and for introns. However, the intensity of purifying selection varies considerably among protein coding regions, and the variance in mutation rate of protein coding regions is therefore higher than that of silent sites. Perhaps more importantly, the rate of divergence between species of coding regions could be substantially slower than the rate that polymorphisms appear at the population level if purifying selection frequently removes these polymorphisms before they fix. This could explain why IMa2, which considers variation at all sites, estimates older divergent times, as compared to MIMAR, for which we analysed only variation at putatively neutral or almost neutral sites (synonymous sites and introns). It is also conceivable that generation time in pipids is longer than 1 year, which would cause the estimated mutation rate to be too low, and exaggerate divergence time estimates from MIMAR and IMa2 analysis. This could happen, for example, if females occasionally skip breeding seasons while their eggs mature, or if some breeding seasons typically produced no offspring due to environmental conditions or tadpole cannibalism (McCoid & Fritts 1980; Tinsley & McCoid 1996). Thus, while we view these divergence estimates as worth reporting, especially because they are based on a large dataset of independent sequence data (Bewick AJ, Chain FJJ, Heled J, Evans BJ unpublished data), they must be interpreted with considerable caution because they do not accommodate uncertainty or inaccuracy in the calibration point or generation time or, for IMa2 analysis, the effects of natural selection on evolution of protein coding regions. That said, our inferences about relative divergence times of X. clivii and X. largeni are independent of the estimate of the rate of mutation, although they do assume a relatively constant rate of mutation in each lineage. Moreover, the relative divergence times of X. clivii and X. largeni and also the relative magnitudes of population sizes within each species that were estimated by MIMAR and IMa2 were highly consistent.
In any case, these results argue strongly that the Rift Valley is a barrier to migration of African clawed frogs. However, it is not clear why this is the case, especially for X. clivii. Some X. clivii specimens in this study were collected at elevations lower than most of the major Rift Valley Lakes of Ethiopia (Table S1, Supporting informa-
tion) and X. clivii is known from Godare at an elevation of 820 m asl, suggesting that altitude-specific ecological conditions of the Rift are not an absolute barrier to migration for this species. At least two populations of X. clivii have been recorded in the Rift Valley (Largen 2001), although unfortunately samples from these localities were not obtained for this study. Our sampling dramatically extends the known distribution of X. largeni, consistent with a wider ecological tolerance than the previously known distribution would suggest, although this species clearly is not as widespread as X. clivii. Despite these differences in extant distributions and presumably in ecological specificity, the timing of differentiation across the Rift are quite similar in both species. Thus, whatever factors influenced Xenopus migration across the Rift did not appear to have a substantially distinct impact on X. clivii as compared X. largeni. This differs, for example, from the lowland fynbos ecosystem in coastal portions of Cape Province, South Africa, where differentiation of Xenopus gilli is much higher than differentiation of sympatric X. laevis populations (Evans et al. 1997).
For X. clivii and X. largeni, the inferred population size of the ancestral population was much larger than both descendant populations according to MIMAR and IMa2 analysis. An inference of a large ancestral effective population size relative to descendant populations is fairly common in studies of natural populations, and could either reflect real features of their evolutionary histories or be an artifact of coalescent based analyses such as MIMAR and IMa (Hey & Nielsen 2004, 2007; Becquet & Przeworski 2007, 2009). One possible cause of inflated estimates of h is violation of model assumptions, for example by ancestral population structure. Becquet & Przeworski (2009) considered the impact of three scenarios involving departures from the standard isolation-migration models including ancestral population structure prior to divergence with no gene flow (allopatric speciation), and ephemeral gene flow between differentiated populations after divergence, either immediately after divergence (parapatric speciation) or after a period of no gene flow following divergence (secondary contact). For the allopatric model but not the parapatric speciation or secondary contact models, longer periods of ancestral population structure before population divergence were associated with higher estimated values of hA. In the data from X. clivii and X. largeni, recent or recurrent bottlenecks in the descendant populations on either side of the Rift could also account for the small descendant hs compared to hA. Population bottlenecks could have been caused, for example, by climatological transitions or by metapopulation dynamics on either side of the Rift. This post hoc speculation could be explored further by testing

whether other species in Ethiopia sharing their aquatic habitat with Xenopus have a similar demographic signature of recent population size decline.
Goodness of fit simulations for MIMAR analysis highlight intricacies of the evolutionary histories of X. clivii and X. largeni. These simulations suggest that some observed summary statistics for X. clivii did not match expectations. For example, observed values of Tajima’s D were significantly higher in X. clivii than in simulations (Table 3). In a structured population, coalescence occurs more rapidly within a subpopulation but slowly between subpopulations, reducing rare frequency alleles and increasing intermediate frequency alleles. With a finite number of demes, population structure has negligible impact on Tajima’s D when samples are randomly selected from all demes, although Tajima’s D can be higher when samples are selected from only one deme (De & Durrett 2007). Given what we know about the range of X. clivii, it seems unlikely that unsampled demes play a major role in estimates of Tajima’s D reported here. Recent bottlenecks are also transiently associated with positive Tajima’s D (Fay & Wu, 1999). Another explanation for unexpectedly high Tajima’s D in X. clivii, of course, is non-neutral evolution of sites linked to the synonymous positions we analysed (Tajima 1989).
Goodness of fit simulations for MIMAR analysis also suggested that the observed FST of X. clivii was significantly lower than simulated values (Table 3). FST was calculated following Hudson et al. (1992) as (pbetween– pwithin) ⁄ pbetween, where pbetween and pwithin are the average nucleotide divergence between and within populations respectively. As such, the lower than expected observed FST in X. clivii is clearly caused by population structure in both descendant populations (as revealed by Structure and Structurama analysis; Table 2, Fig. 3), which increases pwithin. Strasburg & Rieseberg (2010) considered a violation of the standard isolation-migration model by population structure in both descendant lineages using the program IMa (Hey & Nielsen, 2004, 2007) and Evans (2011) considered violation by population structure in one descendant lineage using MIMAR. Both of these studies found that population structure increased estimates of the effective population size of the structured descendant populations, but did not impact the mean estimates of other parameter estimates such as divergence time and ancestral h. For this reason we do not anticipate that contemporary population structure in X. clivii substantially affected parameter estimates other than the descendant hs (hNW and hSE). Population structure can increase h in situations where differentiated populations rarely go extinct, or it can decrease h if differentiated demes have a metapopulation structure characterized by extinction and re-
colonization (Nei & Takahata 1993; Whitlock & Barton 1997). Thus, in addition to recent bottlenecks, extinction ⁄ re-colonization metapopulation dynamics northwest and southeast of the Rift could also account for the large difference between descendant and ancestral h estimates.
Significant differentiation across the Ethiopian Rift Valley also has been reported in other species. The frog genus Paracassina, for example, is endemic to Ethiopia and includes two species; one (P. obscura) occurs west of the Rift and other (P. kounhiensis) occurs east (Largen 2001). In the Gelada, mitochondrial DNA control region divergence on either side of the Rift is about 10% (Belay & Mori 2006). Mitochondrial DNA of the Ethiopian wolf is also significantly differentiated across the Rift, though not reciprocally monophyletic (Gottelli et al. 2004). Similarly, two populations of the plant Arabis alpine each exhibit significant differentiation across the Rift (Assefa et al. 2007). In the naked mole rat Heterocephalis glaber, divergence between mitochondrial DNA on either side of the Rift Valley exceeds that found among samples from Kenya (Faulkes et al. 2004). In the African clawed frogs examined here, the level of differentiation and lack of substantial migration across the Rift Valley is suggestive of reproductive isolation of populations on either side of the Rift. Further research on migration within the Rift Valley, mating preferences of individuals on either side, and differentiation of morphology and vocalization with clarify the taxonomic status of these populations and possible causes for subdivision within both species.
