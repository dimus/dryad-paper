Abstract
Limited dispersal and connectivity in marine organisms can have negative fitness effects in populations that are small and isolated, but reduced genetic exchange may also promote the potential for local adaptation. Here, we compare the levels of genetic diversity and connectivity in the coral Montastraea cavernosa among both central and peripheral populations throughout its range in the Atlantic. Genetic data from one mitochondrial and two nuclear loci in 191 individuals show that M. cavernosa is subdivided into three genetically distinct regions in the Atlantic: Caribbean-North Atlantic, Western South Atlantic (Brazil) and Eastern Tropical Atlantic (West Africa). Within each region, populations have similar allele frequencies and levels of genetic diversity; indeed, no significant differentiation was found between populations separated by as much as 3000 km, suggesting that this coral species has the ability to disperse over large distances. Gene flow within regions does not, however, translate into connectivity across the entire Atlantic. Instead, substantial differences in allele frequencies across regions suggest that genetic exchange is infrequent between the Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa. Furthermore, markedly lower levels of genetic diversity are observed in the Brazilian and West African populations. Genetic diversity and connectivity may contribute to the resilience of a coral population to disturbance. Isolated peripheral populations may be more vulnerable to human impacts, disease or climate change relative to those in the genetically diverse Caribbean-North Atlantic region.

Introduction
The Caribbean has extensive reef development, but most Atlantic reefs outside the Caribbean are not biogenic in origin. Rather, these are rocky reefs sparsely colonized by corals and other benthic invertebrates. These peripheral rocky reefs also have lower coral abundance and fewer coral species than the Caribbean, but host a rich endemic fauna of marine organisms (Rosenberg 1993; Jones 1994; Rios 1994; Floeter et al. 2008), including two endemic genera of corals (Laborel

1969b, 1974). Several coral species have a wide distribution across the Atlantic, extending well beyond the Caribbean to the peripheral reefs of the southern and eastern Atlantic. It remains unclear, however, whether these broad distributions reflect continued genetic exchange between geographically distant populations. Understanding how peripheral populations are connected to one another and to more central populations can shed light on how distantly corals are capable of dispersing and what types of barriers limit dispersal in the Atlantic. Furthermore, peripheral populations may exhibit lower genetic diversity as a consequence of smaller effective populations sizes and isolation (although exceptions exist, see the review by Eckert

et al. 2008). As genetic variation is the raw material that allows populations to evolve in response to changing environments, reduced genetic diversity may increase a population’s vulnerability to disturbances. Here, we provide the first molecular dataset from a coral species spanning Caribbean and several peripheral reefs in the Atlantic to determine the level of genetic diversity and connectivity among these populations.
Genetic exchange in sessile organisms like corals is achieved primarily by larval dispersal. The extent of transport varies depending on larval longevity and behaviour and ocean circulation. Some coral species are able to maintain competent larvae for 50–100 days after fertilization (Richmond 1987; Graham et al. 2008), but average larval lifetime can be quite variable across different species (Nishikawa & Sakai 2005), being as short as 10 days for some (Goffredo & Zaccanti 2004). Nutritional reserves and the presence of zooxanthellae can affect potential larval lifetime (Isomura & Nishihira 2001; Harii et al. 2002) and substantial mortality as a result of predation by reef fish during coral spawning (Pratchett et al. 2001) can reduce the number of dispersing larvae. Ocean currents aid dispersal by carrying larvae downstream and limit dispersal upstream or across strong currents, but making predictions about larval dispersal patterns solely on the basis of currents can be difficult. Large-scale patterns of ocean circulation are averages that do not represent all possible paths for dispersal. Swimming behaviour allows larvae to orient and follow settlement cues (Raimondi & Morse 2000), and vertical migration can lead larvae to leave one current and enter another. Low water temperatures or low salinity may pose impermeable barriers to dispersal; the latter can shorten the planktonic period by decreasing the larvae’s selectivity for suitable substrate (Vermeij et al. 2006). Complex meso-scale circulation and local eddies also play a role and simulation studies have shown that local retention of larvae can be very high (Cowen et al. 2000, 2006; James et al. 2002).
For reasons of the logistic challenges in tracking or simulating larval movement, molecular methods are often used to infer connectivity on coral reefs. However, studies of connectivity in corals are relatively scarce relative to other reef inhabitants, despite their importance as foundation species on reefs. This is in part as a result of difficulty in finding molecular markers that contain sufficient intraspecific variation. Mitochondrial DNA in corals and other anthozoans, unlike most other organisms, evolves at a much slower rate and is usually invariant at the level of species (Shearer et al. 2002). Despite the low levels of variation in the mitochondrial genome, nuclear variation has been found in corals (Hellberg 2006). Allozymes have been employed successfully in studies of population differentiation in
Indo-Pacific corals (Stoddart 1984; Ayre & Dufty 1994), and more recently, efforts have been made to develop microsatellite markers for Caribbean coral species (Severance et al. 2004; Shearer & Coffroth 2004; Baums et al. 2005a). For this study, sequence data from one mitochondrial and two nuclear loci were used to estimate levels of genetic diversity and population differentiation in a common and widespread Caribbean coral.
The coral Montastraea cavernosa is an abundant reef builder in the Caribbean, being found throughout the region, from Panama ́ to Florida, east to the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and as far north as Bermuda (32°18¢N, 64°46¢W), in the north Atlantic. This species is also widespread in the South Atlantic, being common along the coast of Brazil from Cabedelo, Para ́ıba (6°57¢S, 34°49¢W) to Vitoria, Esp ́ırito Santo (20°21¢S, 40°16¢W) (Laborel 1969a). Montastraea cavernosa has also been reported in the offshore island of Fernando de Noronha (Laborel 1969a) as well as Parcel Manuel Luiz (Moura et al. 1999), an offshore reef located 500 km east of the Amazon outflow. Although this species was previously unknown off the north coast of Brazil, we discovered abundant colonies on the offshore reef of Pedra da Risca do Meio (3°34¢S, 38°24¢W) at depths of 􏰁25 m. Montastraea cavernosa is also one of the most common coral species in the islands of Sa ̃ o Tome ́ , Pr ́ıncipe and Annobon in the Gulf of Guinea, West Africa, but it has not been reported along the West African mainland nor in the Cape Verde islands further north (Laborel 1974).
Montastraea cavernosa is a gonochoric broadcast spawning species with an annual cycle of gametogenesis (Szmant 1991). Spawning takes place approximately one week after the full moon in August and September and in some locations in October as well (Acosta & Zea 1997). Oogenesis takes place annually except for 1–2 months after spawning, whereas spermatogenesis occurs from April to August. Zooxanthellae are not present in the eggs and must be acquired from the water column de novo. Montastraea cavernosa produces larger eggs than Montastraea annularis, another abundant reef-builder in the Caribbean, although recent phylogenetic analyses indicate that they are not closely related (Fukami et al. 2004b, 2008). The larger eggs of M. cavernosa may increase larval survival time and dispersal capability (Acosta & Zea 1997), as well as increase survivorship after settlement.
Materials and methods
Study sites and sample collection
Tissue samples of Montastraea cavernosa were collected
from eight sites spanning the Atlantic Ocean: three sites Ó 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

within the Caribbean (Belize, Panama ́ and Puerto Rico), one site in the North Atlantic (Bermuda), three sites in the Western South Atlantic (Abrolhos, Joa ̃o Pessoa and Fortaleza, Brazil) and one site in the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (Sa ̃o Tome ́ & Pr ́ıncipe, Gulf of Guinea). A hammer and chisel were used to break a small piece (􏰁 2– 5 cm2) off the coral, taking care to minimize damage to the overall colony. Fresh tissue was scraped off the living surface and put into vials containing guanidine thiocyanate solution (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1% N-lauroyl sarcosin sodium, 10 mM Tris pH8, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol). Samples were stored at room temperature and can be kept in these conditions for upwards of several months. Skeletal vouchers for each sample were labelled, bleached and dried.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
For DNA extraction, equal volumes of coral tissue digested in guanidine thiocyanate solution and phenol extraction buffer (PEB; 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) were mixed, then added to twice the volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). This mixture was vortexed, centrifuged at high speed and the supernatant recovered. DNA was precipitated with 100% isopropanol and resuspended in 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0.
The mitochondrial marker used in this study was the intergenic region (IGR) between cytochrome oxidase I (cox1) and the methionine transfer RNA gene (referred to as cox1-trnM IGR hereafter). This region was chosen because it was found to be one of the longest and most variable IGRs in the mitochondrial genome of the M. annularis species complex (Fukami & Knowlton 2005). The region was amplified using primers published in Fukami et al. (2004a).
Two nuclear markers were used in this study. b-tubulin has previously been used for coral phylogenetics (Fukami et al. 2004b; Nunes et al. 2008) and to differentiate cryptic species of corals (Lopez & Knowlton 1997). In M. cavernosa, amplification of the b-tubulin gene yields two bands, one at 􏰁1000 bp (b-tub1) and another at 750bp (b-tub2). Both bands were purified and sequenced, revealing two gene products with the same partial amino acid sequence, but different intron lengths, most likely the result of a duplication. b-tub1 has an intron of 611 bp, whereas b-tub2 has an intron of 284 bp. The two markers were tested for linkage disequilibrium using Arlequin v. 3.11 (Excoffier et al. 2005), and although linkage was detected among a subset of nucleotide sites within each locus, no significant linkage was found across the two markers (data not shown). Therefore, these two markers were assumed to be independent loci. b-tub1 and b-tub2 were amplified
simultaneously, using published primers (Lopez & Knowlton 1997).
Amplification of all three markers was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) consisting of 5 lL of 10 · Buffer (containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2 and 0.01% gelatin), 2 lL of primers (10 lM), 1 lL of dNTP (200 mM), 1 U Taq polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich), 1–2 lL of template and water to 50 lL. The thermal cycler profile used had an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C⁄45 s, 54 °C⁄45 s for cox1-trnM IGR or 58 °C⁄45 s for b-tub1 and b-tub2, 72 °C⁄1 min 30 s, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min.
For the mitochondrial locus, a 10to 15-lL aliquot of the PCR product was purified for sequencing by adding 0.5 U of exonuclease 1, 0.5 U of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 1 lL of 10 · SAP buffer, and incubating at 37 °C for 60 min. The enzymes were deactivated by heating to 80 °C for 15 min. To purify the PCR products of the two nuclear markers, b-tub1and b-tub2, a 40 lL aliquot was run through a 1% agarose gel prepared with Tris-acetate EDTA (TAE). Each fragment was excised from the gel and purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) according the manufacturer’s protocol.
Sequencing of all loci was performed directly on purified PCR products for both forward and reverse directions using an ABI 3130xl genetic analyzer with the ABI BigDye Terminator v3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Cycle sequencing reactions were purified with Sephadex G-50 (Sigma). Sequence chromatographs were viewed and edited using Sequencher v4.5 software (Gene Codes Corp). For b-tub1, indels were observed at sites 812, 881 and three adjacent indels at sites 450, 451 and 452. In the case of individuals heterozygous for two or more indels, an internal sequencing primer was designed to obtain sequence data between indels (btubintR: 5¢-TCA GCT GGT ACT CGT TGT CG-3¢). For b-tub2, only one indel was found, at site 451. Heterozygous alleles were identified by double peaks observed in sequences from both directions.
Three of heterozygous individuals from each nuclear locus was cloned using the pGEM-T Vector system (Promega) (b-tub1 = samples E05, P24, and P570; b-tub2 = samples E08, E24 and M01). Sequences from 6 to 8 clones per individual were used as input data along with homozygous direct sequences (n = 64 for b-tub1 and n = 73 for b-tub2) to reconstruct haplotypes for heterozygous individuals using PHASE v 2.1.1 (Stephens et al. 2001; Stephens & Scheet 2005). For b-tub1, the five indel sites and an additional four sites (sites 301, 438, 524 and 881) containing multiple mutations (>2 phases) were excluded from the analysis. No sites were excluded for b-tub2. The algorithm was run three

times for 100 iterations with 10 thinning interval steps and 100 burn in steps. The best pairs of haplotypes for each individual resulting from the run with the highest average value for the goodness of fit were used for each nuclear locus. Posterior probabilities of >0.90 were observed for 97.7% and 95.0% of base calls for b-tub1 and b-tub2 respectively.
Data analysis
A statistical parsimony network was constructed for each locus using TCS v1.21 (Clement et al. 2000) after sequences had been aligned using Clustal_X v1.83.1 (Thompson et al. 1997). Recombination in the two nuclear loci was inferred as reticulations in the haplotype network and tested by the four-gamete test in DnaSP (Librado & Rozas 2009). Six loops (1–3 mutations in length) were observed in b-tub1 and five loops (1–2 mutations in length) in b-tub2. For clarity, loops were omitted from the haplotype network and only internal branches are shown. For b-tub1 and b-tub2, 10.4% and 5.0% of pairwise comparisons contained all four gametic types, respectively. As a result, analyses using a coalescent framework (that assume no recombination) were not attempted.
A pie chart of the haplotype frequencies for each population was plotted on a map of the Atlantic Ocean for each locus. For reasons of the high number of haplotypes encountered in the two nuclear loci, pie segments represented the haplotype frequencies of the three most common haplotypes and the following haplotype frequency classes: (i) haplotypes belonging to the most common haplotype clade (Clade A for btub1 or Clade C btub2, see Results section), (ii) haplotypes belonging to the less common haplotype clade (Clade B for btub1 or Clade D for b-tub2) and (iii) private alleles (haplotypes that were restricted to a geographical region). Haplotypes were labelled by numbers preceded by the letters J for b-tub1, by the letter L for btub2, and by the letter M for cox1-trnM IGR.
The number of haplotypes (H) and segregating sites (s) were tallied per population and overall for each locus. Genetic diversity for each population was measured by the gene diversity (h), nucleotide diversity (p) and average nucleotide changes (k). Gene diversity is defined as the probability that two randomly chosen haplotypes are different in the sample, whereas nucleotide diversity is the probability that two randomly chosen homologous sites are different. Population genetic structure was inferred by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) in Arlequin v. 3.11 (Excoffier et al. 2005). Hierarchical AMOVA was used to estimate levels of genetic differentiation among populations (Fst), between groups of populations or regions (Fct), and between populations
within regions (Fsc). Regions used in the analysis were Brazil (Abrolhos, Joa ̃o Pessoa and Fortaleza), the Gulf of Guinea (Sa ̃ o Tome ́ Island), the Caribbean (Panama ́ , Belize and Puerto Rico) and the North Atlantic (Bermuda). A second scenario was tested where the Caribbean and North Atlantic groups were merged to form a single region (greater Caribbean). AMOVA was performed independently for all three loci. Pairwise FST values were calculated to estimate differentiation between populations. Both AMOVA and FST calculations used pairwise distances among sequences. Deviations from Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), in the form of heterozygote excesses or deficits, were calculated using exact tests in Genepop (Raymond & Rousset 1995). Statistics for neutral sequence evolution (Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs) and linkage disequilibrium among and within loci were tested using Arlequin v3.11.
Divergent mitochondrial haplotypes
Three highly divergent mitochondrial haplotypes were observed in a small number of individuals from Belize and Panama ́. To determine the origin of these divergent mitochondrial haplotypes, the following tests were performed: (i) To determine if the divergent mitochondrial haplotypes represented a cryptic species within M. cavernosa, nuclear sequence data (btub1 and btub2) were obtained for these individuals to test whether divergence was observed in the nuclear genome of these individuals as well. (ii) To assess whether the divergent mitochondrial haplotypes were introgressed from another species, sequences of the flanking and more conserved gene, cox1, were obtained from four individuals carrying the divergent mitochondrial haplotypes and four individuals carrying the typical M. cavernosa haplotype for cox1-trnM IGR. As cox1 has been used to infer phylogenetic relationships in corals, the sequences obtained from our samples could be compared against the GenBank database and used for species identification in the case of introgression from another species. (3) To determine if the divergent mitochondrial haplotypes resulted from a pseudogene that was amplified simultaneously with cox1-trnM IGR, four individuals carrying the divergent allele and four individuals carrying the typical alleles were cloned using the pGEM-T cloning vector system. Ten clones were sequenced per individual to detect if multiple regions were being amplified following our protocol.
Results
A total of 191 individuals from eight populations were genotyped for this study (Sequences have been deposited in GenBank, accession numbers FJ854573–FJ854692).
Ó 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

Sequence lengths for the three loci were 834 bp for cox1trnM IGR, 961 bp for btub1 and 612 bp for btub2. Haplotype frequencies for each population are shown in Table S1 and the genotype of each sampled individual can be found in Table S2. Overall, populations did not show a significant departure from neutrality (P > 0.05), but negative Tajima’s D values were observed in btub1 for Abrolhos (D = )1.85, P = 0.015) and Fortaleza (D = )1.43, P = 0.048), and negative Fu’s Fs values were observed in Belize for both btub1 (Fs = )14.82, P = 0.002) and btub2 (Fs = )5.455, P = 0.053). Significant heterozygote deficits were observed in the Joa ̃o Pessoa population for the btub1 locus (P = 0.014) and in the Gulf of Guinea population for btub2 (P = 0.013). For all other populations, no significant heterozygote excesses or deficits were observed for either locus. Results for HWE and neutrality tests for the three loci are shown in Table 1.
Divergent mitochondrial haplotypes
A total of nine individuals from two Caribbean populations were found to have highly divergent mitochondrial haplotypes (Belize, n = 7, and Panama ́, n = 2), which differed from the common haplotypes by 40 base substitutions. These polymorphisms were distributed throughout the sequence and no indels were observed. All individuals carrying a divergent mitochondrial haplotype were genotyped as having typical Montastraea cavernosa alleles at both nuclear loci. As there does not appear to be divergence in the nuclear genome separating these individuals from the rest of the population, it is unlikely that they represent a cryptic species.
Sequences of the cox1 gene were obtained for eight individuals from Panama ́ and Belize. All eight individuals had identical cox1 sequences, typical of M. cavernosa as identified by BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997), irrespective of whether they carried the typical cox1-trnM IGR haplotype or the rare divergent cox1-trnM IGR haplotype. As all individuals can be identified as M. cavernosa based on cox1, and given that the mitochondrial genome does not recombine, it is unlikely that the divergent mitochondrial haplotypes were introgressed from another species.
Ten clones were sequenced per individual out of a sample of eight individuals to check for the presence of a pseudogene that could be amplified simultaneously with cox1-trnM IGR. Of the eight cloned individuals, every individual had only one sequence for all 10 clones, suggesting that these divergent haplotypes are not derived from a pseudogene.
Although none of the above tests has conclusively determined the origin of the divergent sequences, the results make it unlikely that these sequences represent a cryptic species, an introgressed allele or a pseudo-
gene. Therefore, the divergent sequences were kept in the analyses and treated as regular alleles.
Haplotype distribution
Statistical parsimony networks for haplotypes from each locus are shown in Fig. 1A–C. Over all sampling locations, 74 haplotypes were observed in b-tub1, 40 haplotypes were observed in b-tub2 and six haplotypes were observed in the mitochondrial cox1-trnM IGR.
The b-tub1 network was divided into two clades of haplotypes (Clades A and B), which were separated by at least nine mutations (Fig. 1A). Individuals heterozygous for alleles belonging to each of the two clades were observed in all populations, except for the Gulf of Guinea population, where all observed haplotypes were from Clade A. Six haplotypes (J1, J3, J7, J9, J12 and J13) were shared between Caribbean and Brazilian populations, whereas only two haplotypes (J2 and J5) were shared between populations in Brazil and the Gulf of Guinea. No shared haplotypes were found between the Gulf of Guinea and the Caribbean. Sixty-six of 74 haplotypes were endemic to one of the three major regions (Caribbean, Brazil or Gulf of Guinea) and differed by only a few mutations from the more common haplotypes. Forty-four haplotypes (59%) were observed only once.
The haplotype network for b-tub2 was also separated into two haplotypes clades (Clades C and D) that were at least four mutations apart (Fig. 1B). Individuals heterozygous for the two clades were found in all populations. Two common haplotypes (L1 and L4) were found in all populations across the Atlantic, whereas another haplotype (L2) was shared between the Caribbean and Brazil. All other haplotypes were regionally restricted, although these differed by at most three mutations from haplotypes found in an adjacent region and 22 haplotypes (55%) were observed only once.
In the mitochondrial marker (Fig. 1C), most Caribbean individuals shared one common haplotype (M2) whereas all South Atlantic individuals shared another common haplotype (M1), which differed from the common Caribbean haplotype by one mutation. The other mitochondrial haplotypes (M3–M6) were observed only in Belize and Panama ́ and three (M4–M6) differed from the common haplotypes at 40 nucleotide sites. Three haplotypes (50%) were observed only once. The results of additional tests that were performed to identify the origin of the divergent haplotypes are summarized in the preceding section.

 Ni is the number of sampled individuals, Na is the number of sampled alleles (Na = 2Ni for diploid loci,
locus), H is the number of unique haplotypes observed, s is the number of segregating sites, h is the gene diversity, p is the average nucleotide diversity and k is the average number of nucleotide differences. Statistically significant values (a = 0.05) are highlighted in bold. Values of h, p and k are consistently greater for Caribbean and North Atlantic populations and lower in peripheral populations in Brazil and Gulf of Guinea. For the mitochondrial locus, several diversity indices and tests of neutrality have a value of zero because only one haplotype was observed among all sampled individuals for those populations.

Haplotypes observed in the Caribbean, Brazil and Gulf of Guinea are shown as white, grey and black circles respectively. The size of each circle reflects the frequency that a haplotype is observed.

Instead, the number of polymorphic sites between haplotypes is indicated.
loci, Caribbean and North Atlantic populations (Belize, Panama ́, Puerto Rico and Bermuda) had similar haplotype frequencies, as did populations along the coast of Brazil (Abrolhos, Joa ̃o Pessoa and Fortaleza). Populations in different regions (Caribbean-North Atlantic vs. Brazil vs. Gulf of Guinea), however, differed in their haplotype frequencies. For example, the frequency of the most common b-tub1 allele (J1) in the Brazilian populations ranged from 0.71 to 0.75, but in the Caribbean, the frequency of this allele ranged only from 0.08 to 0.10, and was absent in Puerto Rico. The most common btub1 haplotype in the
Gulf of Guinea (J5, P = 0.86) was present in the Brazilian populations, but at a much lower frequency (P = 0.04– 0.05), and was absent from all Caribbean populations. A similar pattern in haplotype frequencies was observed for b-tub2. For the mitochondrial locus, South Atlantic populations all shared the same haplotype (M1), whereas Caribbean populations, including Bermuda, shared another common haplotype (M2). Haplotype M3 was observed only once in Belize. In the Caribbean, three divergent haplotypes were present at low frequencies in Belize (M4 and M6 P = 0.026 each; M5, P = 0.103) and Panama ́ (M5, P = 0.105).
Genetic diversity patterns
Molecular diversity indices for each marker and for each of the populations are shown in Table 1. For all loci, diversity indices were similar between the Caribbean and North Atlantic populations. The Caribbean-North Atlantic sites showed greater levels of molecular diversity than the populations from Brazil and Gulf of Guinea. For example, nucleotide diversity (p) in b-tub1 ranged from 0.008 ± 0.004 in Bermuda to 0.010 ± 0.005 in Panama ́, but in Brazil, p ranged from 0.002 ± 0.002 to 0.004 ± 0.002 and in the Gulf of Guinea, p = 0.001 ± 0.001. Nucleotide diversity was an order of magnitude greater in the most diverse site (Belize) relative to the least diverse site (Gulf of Guinea). A similar pattern was observed for gene diversity (h), average nucleotide changes (k) and number of haplotypes and segregating sites for both nuclear loci, with greater genetic diversity in the Caribbean relative to the South Atlantic populations, and with the Gulf of Guinea populations consistently being the least diverse of all (Table 1).
Much lower molecular diversity was observed in the mitochondrial locus relative to the nuclear loci. Most sampled individuals had one of two most common haplotypes, with one haplotype being fixed or nearly so in the South Atlantic (M1) and Caribbean and North Atlantic (M2) populations. As a result, diversity indices were 0 for most locations, except for Belize and Panama ́, where three divergent haplotypes occurred at low frequencies.
Genetic structure
Montastraea cavernosa exhibited significant structure in populations across the Atlantic Ocean in both nuclear and mitochondrial loci. Significant genetic structure was observed between populations (Fst = 0.196–0.371) and between regions (Fct = 0.187–0.367) for all three loci (see Table 2). However, no significant genetic structure was found among populations within regions for the two nuclear loci (Fsc = 0–0.006), and only a small amount of differentiation was present among

The frequencies of selected common haplotypes are also shown to emphasize the differences among populations.

Variance components and the percentage of variation attributed to each hierarchical level for each locus are also shown in Table 2. Variation within populations accounts for 62.9–81.9% of the total observed variation, while variation among populations accounts for 17.04–36.72%. Less than 1% of the variation is attributed to variation among populations within regions for every locus, suggesting that populations within regions are similar.
Pairwise Fst values for the three markers are shown in Table 3. Over all three markers, there was no significant differentiation among populations from
Belize, Panama ́, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. Likewise, no significant differentiation was found among populations along the coast of Brazil (Abrolhos, Joa ̃o Pessoa and Fortaleza). In contrast, populations from Brazil and the Gulf of Guinea showed significant differentiation against all other sites, except in the mitochondrial marker, where there was no differentiation between Brazil and the Gulf of Guinea, because the same haplotype (M1) was found in all individuals for the two regions. For the two nuclear loci, differentiation between Caribbean and Brazilian populations was moderate, ranging from 0.060 to 0.164 in btub1 and from 0.127 to 0.294 in btub2. Strong differentiation was observed between the Gulf of Guinea and all others populations. In particular, Fst values were the greatest between the Gulf of

Discussion
Divergent mitochondrial haplotypes
The presence of three rare and divergent haplotypes in the cox1-trnM IGR locus is unexpected given the low intraspecific variation observed in the mitochondrial genome of corals (Shearer et al. 2002). Several tests were conducted to determine the origins of these haplotypes, but a conclusive source was not found.
Although the levels of divergence found in the mitochondrial locus may suggest the presence of a cryptic species, little or no divergence compared to typical Montastraea cavernosa alleles is observed in these individuals
at the nuclear loci (0–0.15% divergence for both nuclear loci). Lineage sorting in the mitochondrial genome is expected to be 4 times greater than at nuclear loci because of its haploid state and maternal mode of inheritance. Therefore, the 4.8% divergence observed in cox1trnM IGR should be accompanied by 􏰁1.2% divergence at the nuclear loci, but this is not observed in b-tub1 or b-tub2. The nuclear data presented here thus do not support the presence of a cryptic species.
Introgression from another species also appears unlikely. Recent phylogenetic revisions suggest that M. cavernosa does not appear to have any close relatives in the Caribbean, its most similar association being Diploastrea heliopora (Fukami et al. 2004b, 2008), a species found exclusively in the Pacific. Montastraea cavernosa and Montastraea annularis are divergent at various loci, including the exon of b-tubulin (Fukami et al. 2008) and

most likely do not represent congeneric species. Nevertheless, sequences of cox1-trnM IGR from M. annularis were compared to typical and divergent haplotypes of M. cavernosa to determine if this species could be the source of introgressed alleles. The sequence alignment was very poor owing to multiple indels and numerous substitutions, indicating that the divergent haplotypes in M. cavernosa are more similar to typical M. cavernosa haplotypes than to M. annularis. Sequencing of the adjacent cox1 gene revealed that individuals with divergent cox1-trnM IGR had identical cox1 to typical individuals of M. cavernosa. Given that there is no recombination in the mitochondrial genome, the absence of cox1 from another species in individuals containing the divergent haplotypes conflicts with an introgression hypothesis.
Amplification of a gene duplication or transfer of a mitochondrial gene to the nuclear genome (pseudogenes) can, in some cases, be detected by sequencing multiple clones of an amplicon. This test did not reveal any evidence of a pseudogene or duplication of this locus (see Results). As this is a non-coding region, tests for differences in selective constraints between a gene and its pseudogene (for example, comparing synonymous to non-synonymous substitution rates) could not be conducted. Finally, it is unlikely that these divergent haplotypes have been amplified from contaminants. The primers used for amplification were developed using coral mitochondrial genome sequences (Fukami et al. 2004a) and should be specific to corals. Indeed, the most similar sequences resulting from a BLAST search belong to other coral species (although genetic differences are so great from any other sequence found on GenBank, query coverage was only <7%). In addition, independent samples from Belize and Panama ́ taken on separate sampling expeditions and by different scientists yielded identical haplotypes in six individuals (M5). Although the possibility of a contaminant cannot be eliminated, it appears to be unlikely.
The inclusion of divergent mitochondrial haplotypes in the analysis does not greatly alter the interpretation of the patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity. Differentiation between Caribbean and the South Atlantic is supported whether or not the divergent haplotypes are included. In terms of genetic diversity, however, exclusion of the divergent haplotypes would reduce molecular diversity indices in all populations to zero. Such low levels of variation render this locus effectively uninformative and patterns of genetic diversity would then primarily rely on the nuclear loci.

Mitochondrial DNA

The nuclear data reveal significant structure among populations of M. cavernosa spanning three regions separated by 4000–10 000 km in the Atlantic Ocean – the Caribbean, Brazil and Eastern Atlantic. The mitochondrial locus supports a Caribbean and South Atlantic split, but the locus is invariant in Brazilian and African populations (all individuals carry a M1 haplotype). As a result, the mitochondrial locus is not informative regarding gene flow among populations of Brazil and West Africa. These data suggest that there are significant barriers to gene flow for this species across its distributional range, perhaps because of the freshwater plume of the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers and the vast expanses of open-ocean separating areas with suitable habitat. Given that M. cavernosa appears to be able to maintain gene flow over greater distances within the Caribbean than other corals of this region (see the following section), these barriers may be effective for Atlantic corals in general, although further studies are needed to test this prediction.
Restricted gene flow between broad regions in the Atlantic has also been observed in other marine species. Strong differentiation was found between Caribbean and Brazilian populations of the sea urchin Tripneustes ventricosus (Lessios et al. 2003) (Fst = 0.73–0.82), with multiple diagnostic mutations separating the eastern and western Atlantic populations. In other cases, differentiation among regions is so strong that species that were once thought to be amphi-Atlantic, such as the sponge Chondrilla nucula (Klautau et al. 1999) and the blenny Ophioblennius atlanticus (Muss et al. 2001), are currently being reconsidered as allopatric cryptic species.
Nevertheless, barriers of dispersal are not equally effective for all Atlantic reef organisms, even within related groups. In the sea urchins, Eucidaris tribuloides and Diadema antillarium, no significant differentiation was found between populations in the Caribbean and Brazil, but moderate-to-strong differentiation was observed between East and West Atlantic populations (Lessios et al. 1999, 2001). The opposite trend, however, was found for Echinometra lucunter (McCartney et al. 2000). Likewise, levels of connectivity in sponges across the Atlantic are variable (Worheide et al. 2005). Reefassociated fish can be either panmictic, highly differentiated across their range or show some intermediate level of connectivity. In certain species, the Amazon freshwater outflow appears to be the strongest barrier to gene flow (Acanthurus bahianus (Rocha et al. 2002)), whereas the large distances separating the Eastern and Western Atlantic appear to play a more critical role for other species, such as the goldspot goby, (Rocha et al. 2005). Overall, pelagic larval duration does not appear to be a good predictor for patterns of differentiation in reef fish (Bowen et al. 2006). Rather, it appears that
ecology, such as adult habitat preferences (Rocha et al. 2002), and historical events play a more important role in determining patterns of connectivity in Atlantic reef fish. The incongruent patterns observed among sea urchin species also do not correlate with dispersal potential, as four of the studied species have similar larval duration, but different levels of genetic differentiation across the Atlantic.
Gene flow within regions of the Atlantic
In contrast to high levels of differentiation observed in M. cavernosa between regions of the Atlantic, high levels of gene flow are observed within those regions, even at large spatial scales. Notably, the oceanographic isolation of Bermuda from the Caribbean does not appear to have resulted in significant differentiation in populations of M. cavernosa. Similarly, there do not appear to be significant barriers to gene flow among three M. cavernosa populations spanning 2000 km of coast in Brazil.
Our findings of low population differentiation within the Caribbean are in agreement with results for Montastraea faveolata (Severance & Karl 2006), where little differentiation was observed between populations spanning as much as 2000 km, but differ from several other studies that have found significant structure among Caribbean coral populations. Differentiation between eastern and western Caribbean corals has been found in Acropora palmata (Baums et al. 2005b) and Acropora cervicornis (Vollmer & Palumbi 2007) and fine scale intraspecific differentiation has also been observed in Agaricia agaricites (Brazeau et al. 2005) and in some members of the Montastraea annularis complex (Severance & Karl 2006). The discrepancy between our findings and those of previous work on Caribbean corals may, in part, be a result of limited sampling of populations of M. cavernosa within the Caribbean. Our only sampling location in the eastern Caribbean was Puerto Rico. In the case of Acropora palmata, the Puerto Rico population was an intermediate between the eastern and western Caribbean (Baums et al. 2005b). However, the finding that Bermuda was not differentiated with respect to the three Caribbean populations suggests that M. cavernosa may be able to disperse more widely than other Caribbean corals.
Much like the Caribbean, there appears to be continued gene flow between populations of M. cavernosa along the coast of Brazil. This suggests that although the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers pose a major barrier to gene flow between Brazil and the Caribbean, other large rivers within Brazil, such as the Sa ̃o Francisco River, are not impassable for larvae of M. cavernosa. High levels of gene flow have also been inferred for populations of other marine invertebrates in Brazil such as the urchin

D. antillarium (Lessios et al. 2001) and the shrimps Farfanteperanaeus brasiliensis and Litopenaeus schmitti (Gusma ̃o et al. 2005). However, not all marine invertebrates are capable of dispersing as widely along the Brazilian coast. Populations of both Siderastrea stellata and Siderastrea radians were found to have high levels of gene flow along the northeast coast (spanning 350 km), but displayed distinct differences between several northeast and southeast populations (separated by a minimum of 1200 km) (Neves et al. 2008). Greater levels of differentiation in these two corals species compared with M. cavernosa may result from their different reproductive modes; M. cavernosa is a broadcast spawner, whereas S. stellata and S. radians brood larvae that are typically ready to settle within 48 h (Neves et al. 2008). Lower dispersal capability has also been observed in several species of shrimp (Maggioni et al. 2003; Gusma ̃o et al. 2006), oysters (Lazoski 2004) and reef fish (Freitas et al. 2003), with significant structure being found along the coast of Brazil. In sum, M. cavernosa appears to be able to disperse more widely than several other marine invertebrates along the same stretch of Brazilian coastline, in agreement with our findings for the CaribbeanNorth American populations.
Levels of genetic diversity
Genetic diversity, measured by haplotype diversity (h), nucleotide diversity (p) and average nucleotide changes (k), was found to be greater in the Panama ́, Belize, Puerto Rico and Bermuda, relative to the peripheral populations in Brazil and the eastern Atlantic (see Table 1). Reduced genetic diversity in a peripheral population can result from a small founding population or from small effective size because of genetic drift or inbreeding depression. A combination of these factors is likely at work in the isolated coral populations of M. cavernosa in Brazil and the Gulf of Guinea (which has no known neighbouring populations along the African mainland and consistently showed the lowest levels of genetic diversity). Evidence for low genetic diversity in isolated, peripheral populations of corals occurs elsewhere. For example, on Lord Howe Island, the southernmost reef in the Pacific located 700 km from the Great Barrier Reef, four of five studied species, which included both brooders and broadcasters with widely varying geographic ranges, showed reduced genetic diversity (Ayre & Hughes 2004). Nevertheless, the high genetic diversity observed for corals in Bermuda shows that geographical distance alone does not automatically result in isolation and loss of variability.
Depressed levels of genetic diversity can have significant fitness effects resulting in loss of resilience for marine populations. For example, grass beds consisting
of single genotypes of the eelgrass Zostera marina experienced greater mortality and slower growth rates during an episode of intense heat and supported a less diverse associated invertebrate fauna compared with those composed of multiple genotypes (Reusch et al. 2005). These findings suggest that genetic diversity may contribute to a species’ ability to cope with disturbances and that the genetic diversity of foundation species, like the eelgrass, may have broad reaching impacts that affect the entire ecosystem, not just the species itself.
The effects of reduced genetic diversity on the resilience of coral populations remain untested, but other evidence suggests that there may be benefits to genetic diversity. A recent study has found that 3 of 49 surveyed genotypes of the coral Acropora cervicornis were resistant to white band disease in Panama ́ (Vollmer & Kline 2008). Similarly, M. annularis is sometimes able to sustain only partial bleaching because it harbours a diversity of zooxanthellae strains (Rowan et al. 1997) some of which have increased thermal tolerance (Baker 2004; Tchernov et al. 2004; van Oppen et al. 2009), improving its ability to survive under stressful conditions. Thus, the lack of diversity in peripheral coral populations may suggest that these populations will be less resilient to future episodes of environmental or anthropogenic stress, because they lack the full spectrum of genotypes some of which may fare better under disturbance.
Although isolated coral populations in the southern and eastern Atlantic demonstrate lower levels of genetic diversity, this does not mean that they are evolutionary dead ends that do not merit the attention of conservation efforts. On the contrary, reduced gene flow combined with a set of different selective pressures in peripheral populations may play a role in maintaining and generating biological diversity, via local adaptation or allopatric speciation (Templeton 1980; Carson & Templeton 1984). In Brazil, coral populations are exposed to a different set of stressors than in the Caribbean. High rates of sedimentation from the numerous rivers that discharge on the coast, compounded with high winds that fall upon the nearshore year-round, means that the clear calm waters which are typical of the Caribbean Sea are rarely found in Brazil. Different environmental conditions, combined with restricted gene flow may lead to divergence between regions that can induce local adaptation and given sufficient time, allopatric speciation. Divergence between the Caribbean coral Favia fragum and the South Atlantic endemic Favia gravida (Nunes et al. 2008) suggests that peripheral coral populations can be the site of origination of new species. Therefore, conservation efforts in these regions should not be ignored.
Different environmental regimes in the South Atlantic may favour the selection of resistant genotypes to the
Ó 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

stressful environments of the peripheral populations. However, a genotype resistant to a particular set of environmental conditions may no longer be favoured following erratic changes in climate or environment. In a diverse population, new genotypes may be favoured and increase in frequency, but in peripheral populations where only a handful of genotypes exist, drastic environmental change could have devastating results.
The vulnerability of isolated peripheral populations highlights the need for increased awareness and immediate action for conservation in these regions. Both in Brazil and on the islands of the Sa ̃o Tome ́ and Pr ́ıncipe, a large proportion of the population depends on reef resources (Pikitch & Doukakis 2005). Reefs in Brazil are also highly threatened by coral bleaching (Migotto 1997; Castro & Pires 1999), coral disease (Francini et al. 2008), nutrification of coastal environments (Costa et al. 2000, 2008; Costa 2007), competition with aggressive exotic species (Paula & Creed 2004, 2005; Creed 2006) and other human impacts (Lea ̃ o et al. 1994; Lea ̃ o & Kikuchi 2005). But because of difficult access and lower research effort in these areas, conservation in these regions often falls by the wayside. Funding for continued research and conservation in these areas are urgently needed.
