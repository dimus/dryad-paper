Abstract
The potential for widespread, mobile species to exhibit genetic structure without clear geographic barriers is a topic of growing interest. Yet the patterns and mechanisms of structure—particularly over broad spatial scales—remain largely unexplored for these species. Bobcats occur across North America and possess many characteristics expected to promote gene flow. To test whether historical, topographic or ecological factors have influenced genetic differentiation in this species, we analysed 1 kb mtDNA sequence and 15 microsatellite loci from over 1700 samples collected across its range. The primary signature in both marker types involved a longitudinal cline with a sharp transition, or suture zone, occurring along the Great Plains. Thus, the data distinguished bobcats in the eastern USA from those in the western half, with no obvious physical barrier to gene flow. Demographic analyses supported a scenario of expansion from separate Pleistocene refugia, with the Great Plains representing a zone of secondary contact. Substructure within the two main lineages likely reflected founder effects, ecological factors, anthropogenic/topographic effects or a combination of these forces. Two prominent topographic features, the Mississippi River and Rocky Mountains, were not supported as significant genetic barriers. Ecological regions and environmental correlates explained a small but significant proportion of genetic variation. Overall, results implicate historical processes as the primary cause of broad-scale genetic differentiation, but contemporary forces seem to also play a role in promoting and maintaining structure. Despite the bobcat’s mobility and broad niche, large-scale landscape changes have contributed to significant and complex patterns of genetic structure.

Introduction
In both terrestrial and aquatic environments, one can find numerous species that are vagile and distributed continuously across their ranges. Without geographic or habitat barriers to dispersal, unimpeded gene flow is expected to limit the development of population genetic structure and result in either (i) a genetically panmictic population, when dispersal is unbounded relative to the species’ range and mating occurs at random (e.g., Als et al. 2011), or (ii) a simple pattern of isolation by dis-

tance, when dispersal is local and mating occurs more frequently among neighbours (e.g., Platt et al. 2010). Due in part to this assumption, many population genetic studies have concentrated on species that are habitat specialists or have fragmented distributions (Frankham et al. 2002), and abundant, widespread species have historically received less attention. There is increasing interest, however, in testing for genetic structure in wide-ranging organisms (Geffen et al. 2004; Hull et al. 2008; Sacks et al. 2008; Tammeleht et al. 2010). This line of research not only provides insight into the biology of ecologically and often economically important species, but also improves our general understanding of whether and how differentiation can emerge

 without the overriding element of geographic isolation (i.e., development of cryptic population structure).
Despite predictions of panmixia or isolation by distance, several recent studies of large mammals have provided evidence that ecological mechanisms such as natal habitat-biased dispersal can lead to discrete genetic subdivision within continuously distributed species. For example the genetic structure of coyotes (Canis latrans; Sacks et al. 2008) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; Pease et al. 2009) in California, USA, closely parallel habitat subdivisions in the state, and habitatrelated variables such as climate and vegetation types explain a significant portion of the cross-continental genetic variation observed in wolves in Europe and North America (Canis lupus; Geffen et al. 2004; Pilot et al. 2006; Carmichael et al. 2007). Naturally, these observations are somewhat limited, by either a regional scope or focus on social organisms, and additional work is needed to identify whether the phenomenon of ecological divergence applies more broadly. Furthermore, topographic features such as rivers and mountains, although unlikely to function as absolute dispersal barriers for mobile species, can nonetheless restrict gene flow (Rueness et al. 2003; Frantz et al. 2010). At continental scales, it is also important to consider that historical factors such as glaciation events can leave a lasting mark on current population genetic structure (Hewitt
1996). It is unclear, however, whether such events have had significant genetic effects in mobile generalist species, because (i) they may have experienced less restriction in their distributions and movements during the Pleistocene (Barton & Wisely 2012) and (ii) high levels of contemporary gene flow may have erased any evidence of earlier isolation or expansion events (Smith et al. 2011). Few studies have examined genetic variation both across broad spatial scales and at high resolution to evaluate comprehensively the influence of contemporary and historical processes in structuring widespread species.
Bobcats are one of the most common and broadly distributed species in North America (Fig. 1; Anderson & Lovallo 2003). These medium-sized felids are consummate habitat-generalists, thriving in a wide range of environments, and although they are strict carnivores, they have a diverse diet that can include lagomorphs, rodents, deer, birds, reptiles, fish and insects (Larivie`re & Walton 1997). Bobcats are solitary, territorial and have a polygynous mating system (Anderson & Lovallo 2003). They are capable of dispersing long distances (>150 km) (Knick & Bailey 1986; Gosselink et al. 2011), although dispersal distances vary greatly among individuals and study areas (Anderson & Lovallo 2003). Despite anthropogenic changes across North America, bobcats have retained the vast majority of their original

range and appear to be increasing and expanding into once-extirpated areas, such as portions of the agricultural Midwest and heavily populated mid-Atlantic states (Deems & Pursley 1978; Woolf & Hubert 1998; Linde et al. 2012). Based on government surveys, Roberts & Crimmins (2010) estimate the total US bobcat population at approximately 2–3 million individuals. The species was also apparently abundant in the past, as it is commonly found in Pleistocene fossil deposits across much of the USA (Graham & Lundelius 2010).
Collectively, these characteristics—habitat and prey generalist, solitary, vagile, currently and historically abundant and widespread—predict little genetic differentiation across the range of this species. Several local and regional genetic studies, however, support the potential for population structuring in this species because of topographic barriers including major waterways (Straits of Mackinac in Michigan; Williams 2006; Millions & Swanson 2007), intensive row crop agriculture (Midwest Corn Belt; Reding 2011) and mountains (Cascade Range in Oregon; Reding et al. 2011). In addition, the boundaries of 12 morphologically defined bobcat subspecies often correspond with transitions between major ecological regions (i.e. ecotones) or steep clines in climatic variables (Fig. 1; Hall 1981), suggesting that environmental and ecological factors may play a prominent role in differentiating this species across its range. Croteau (2009) found limited phylogeographic structure at mtDNA control region with samples from 14 states and two Canadian provinces, but suggested a potential historical subdivision between western bobcats (California, Wyoming, Nevada and North Dakota) and those from the rest of the sampled range. Unfortunately, the lack of a broad-scale, comprehensive genetic study makes it difficult to evaluate the general importance of topographic, ecological and historical factors in shaping genetic patterns.
In this study, we present a phylogeographic and population genetic analysis of Lynx rufus across the entire USA, its primary range. Our goal was to assess quantitatively the spatial genetic patterns in this widespread species to test whether it exhibits a simple pattern of isolation by distance, or whether more complex patterns emerge from historical and contemporary processes. To achieve this goal, we sampled over 1700 geo-referenced individuals collected from throughout the majority of the bobcat range, including nine of the 12 recognized subspecies, and assessed genetic variation at 􏰀1 kb of mtDNA sequence and 15 microsatellite loci using both individual and population-based analyses. We performed several analyses to test for potential influences of Pleistocene glaciation events on current genetic patterns. We quantified how well major ecological regions explain genetic variation and tested for specific
environmental correlates (elevation, temperature and precipitation measurements) to contemporary patterns of genetic structure, as these variables are important determinants of relevant ecological differences such as habitat. We also evaluated the influence of two prominent topographic features within the bobcat’s range: the Mississippi River and Rocky Mountains. Through this continental-scale survey, we provide insight into the potential mechanisms involved in establishing and maintaining population divergence in this common North American carnivore.
Methods
Sample collection
The sample set consists of tissue and DNA (n = 1702) from live and dead bobcats collected between 1994 and 2011 (Fig. 1; Appendix S1, Supporting information). These samples include data from a stratified random subset of those used in regional examinations in Oregon (n = 108 of 250 total; Reding et al. 2011) and the Midwest (n = 755 of 1447 total; Reding 2011), as well as additional samples obtained and analysed specifically for this study (n = 839). In total, the sample represents 45 states and includes five samples from Mexico. See Supporting information for details on processing location data. The Mexico samples did not have location data and thus were assigned spatial coordinates for visualization purposes only and omitted from spatial analyses. Although we primarily employed individualbased approaches that do not require a priori populations, we grouped individuals into 52 ‘sample groups’ based on geographic proximity and topography to permit the use of several population-based approaches (Fig. S1, Supporting information). We used ArcGIS 10 (ESRI) to calculate the geographic mean center of individuals assigned to each sample group, which we used as the spatial coordinates for the given group.
Laboratory analysis
We extracted DNA using DNeasy (Qiagen) or IDPure (IDLabs) purification kits. We amplified and sequenced a 949-bp portion (excluding the primers) of the mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene (see Supporting information) and used Sequencher 4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation) to edit, assemble and align the sequences. We genotyped individuals at 15 autosomal microsatellite markers developed from domestic cat (Felis catus): FCA008, FCA031, FCA043, FCA077, FCA082, FCA090, FCA096, FCA132, FCA149, FCA391, FCA559 (Menotti-Raymond et al. 1999) and FCA740 (MenottiRaymond et al. 2005); Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis):

Lc109 and Lc111 (Carmichael et al. 2000) and bobcat: BCE5T (Faircloth et al. 2005). See Table S1, Supporting information, for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis conditions. Alleles were scored using the software GENEMAPPER 4.0 (Applied Biosystems).
mtDNA analysis
To investigate historical population structure, we examined relationships among unique mtDNA haplotypes using the Bayesian phylogenetic method of MRBAYES 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001; see Supporting information for details). As intraspecific genealogies are often not well represented by bifurcating trees (Posada & Crandall 2001), we also constructed a median joining network using program NETWORK 4.5 (Bandelt et al. 1999). The haplotypes were nested into hierarchical clades to visualize higher order patterns of association (Templeton & Sing 1993).
To test for evidence of demographic expansion resulting from postglacial recolonization, we used ARLEQUIN 3.5 (Excoffier et al. 2005) to calculate Fu’s FS (Fu 1997) for different phylogenetic subunits indicated by the phylogenetic tree and haplotype network. Recent demographic expansions lead to significant negative values for Fu’s FS. We further evaluated evidence for sudden population growth in each identified clade by constructing mismatch distributions of pairwise nucleotide differences between haplotypes. Mismatch distributions are usually ragged in populations at demographic equilibrium, but unimodal in populations having experienced a recent expansion (Slatkin & Hudson 1991; Rogers & Harpending 1992). We estimated the parameters of a demographic expansion: s = 2ut, h0 = 2uN0 and h1 = 2uN1 (Schneider & Excoffier 1999). The parameters h0 and h1 describe the population sizes before and after the expansion, whereas s reflects the time to expansion. We employed a parametric bootstrap method (1000 permutations) to obtain confidence intervals for the parameters and to test the validity of the sudden expansion model, using the sum of squared deviations between the observed and expected mismatch distributions as the test statistic (Schneider & Excoffier 1999). We estimated the time since expansion from the equation t = s ⁄ 2u, where s is estimated from the mismatch distribution, u is mutation rate per generation for the entire sequenced region and t is measured in units of generations. We used a generation time of 2.3 years that was estimated from demographic data (Gosselink et al. 2011) and u = 6.467 · 10)5 cumulative substitutions ⁄ generation (see Supporting information). As several sources of error could affect our estimate of u, we also considered a lower (2.345 · 10)5) and higher (1.217 · 10)4) estimate (see Supporting information).
We used ARLEQUIN to calculate basic estimates such as haplotype (h) and nucleotide (p) diversities within the total sample and each sample group. To quantify whether genetic diversity decreased with increasing latitude, a pattern consistent with postglacial expansion (Hewitt 2000), we performed regression analyses in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.) and included sample size and sample group area as covariates. To measure genetic differentiation, we used ARLEQUIN to estimate pairwise FST values between the sample groups and to conduct a Mantel test (999 permutations; Mantel 1967) for isolation by distance. To further evaluate patterns of mtDNA population structure, we performed spatial analysis of molecular variance using the program SAMOVA 1.0 (Dupanloup et al. 2002). This approach identifies the structure that maximizes the total genetic variance attributable to differences among groups of populations (FCT). We tested a range for the number of groups (K) from 2 to 10.
Microsatellite data analysis: descriptive statistics
For all data analysis procedures using the microsatellite data, we omitted samples with fewer than eight loci genotyped. With the remaining samples (n = 1680), we calculated for each locus the total number of alleles, observed (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosity and Weir & Cockerham’s (1984) FIS, and tested for deviations from Hardy–Weinberg (HW) and linkage equilibrium using GENEPOP 4.0 (Rousset 2008). To account for multiple tests, we applied the sequential Bonferroni correction (Rice 1989) to significance values (nominal a = 0.05). In addition, we used FSTAT 2.9.3 (Goudet 2001) to calculate allelic richness (AR) within sample groups, corrected for differences in sample size. We used ARLEQUIN to calculate pairwise FST as a measure of differentiation between the sample groups, and to conduct a Mantel test (999 permutations) to test for a positive relationship between genetic (FST ⁄ (1)FST)) and lntransformed geographic distance. In addition, we used GENALEX 6.41 (Peakall & Smouse 2006) to calculate pairwise genetic and geographic distance between all individuals, and again applied a Mantel test with 999 permutations.
Spatial principal components analysis
Multivariate analyses, such as principal components analysis, offer several advantages for genetic analysis in that they do not rely on assumptions of HW and linkage equilibrium, and they can reveal genetic clines as well as discrete populations (Jombart et al. 2009). We performed spatial principal components analysis (sPCA) on the microsatellite data to examine contemporary

genetic structure. This reduced space ordination method, developed by Jombart et al. (2008), takes into account not only the genetic variation between individuals, but also their spatial autocorrelation, by finding synthetic variables that optimize the product of allele frequency variance and Moran’s I, an index of spatial autocorrelation. Highly positive eigenvalues, therefore, reflect axes with both a large variance and a global (i.e., positive spatial autocorrelation) structure. We used the adegenet package (Jombart 2008) of the software R (R Development Core Team) to perform sPCA as well as a permutation procedure to test for a significant global pattern in the data. We used a distance-based connection network such that individuals separated by £250 km (which resulted in all samples having at least one connection) were considered neighbours.
Bayesian clustering analysis
Geographic patterns of genetic structure can often entail complex combinations of clines, clusters and patterns of isolation by distance (Francois & Durand 2010), and multiple analysis methods can provide complimentary information regarding such patterns (Balkenhol et al. 2009). Thus, as another means of examining patterns of microsatellite genetic structure, we employed a spatial Bayesian clustering method using the program BAPS 5 (Corander et al. 2008). We first performed a mixture analysis using the ‘spatial clustering of individuals’ model. The analysis consisted of five iterations of each value of Kmax (the maximum number of populations) for the range Kmax = 1–20. This step determines the optimum number of genetic clusters in the sample based on the partition with the maximum likelihood [L(K)] and highest posterior probability (p), and then assigns each individual to a cluster. In the second step, we performed an admixture analysis conditional on the assignments from the previous step. We used 500 simulations from the observed allele frequencies to estimate admixture coefficients (q), which provide the proportion of an individual’s genotype attributed to each of the identified populations. To provide support for the clusters inferred from the spatial method, we also performed aspatial Bayesian clustering using program STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000; see Supporting information). For each of the populations inferred by BAPS, we calculated standard genetic estimates following the same procedures outlined for the total sample and sample groups.
Topographic barriers
As a first approach to evaluate genetic boundaries, we visually examined the individual cluster memberships from BAPS to determine if the patterns coincided with
topographic features (Safner et al. 2011). To evaluate formally the influence of two prominent features—the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains (i.e. Continental Divide)—we used partial distance-based redundancy analyses (dbRDA), a form of multivariate multiple regression (Legendre & Anderson 1999; McArdle & Anderson 2001). To focus specifically on the effects of these potential barriers, we limited our analysis to include only individuals within 300 km (approximately the longest recorded dispersal distance; Johnson et al. 2010) on either side of the given linear feature. We also omitted samples from Minnesota and Wisconsin when evaluating the Mississippi River as the headwaters are located in this region. We coded the given barrier variable with a 0 if the animal was located west of the feature and 1 if east, and calculated pairwise genetic distance between individuals using GENALEX. We then used DISTLM v.5 (Anderson 2004) to test the relationship between genetic differentiation among individuals (dependent variable) and the topographic feature (predictor variable), having first fit X and Y coordinates as covariables to examine the extent to which the feature explains genetic differentiation above and beyond that explained by geographic distance alone. Statistical significance was tested using 999 permutations of the multivariate residual matrix under the reduced model (Anderson & Legendre 1999).
Ecological and environmental correlates
To examine whether ecological and environmental factors may be important in differentiating this species across its range, we conducted a series of distancebased redundancy analyses to test for a relationship between genetic differentiation among individuals (dependent variable) and several geographic, ecological and climate variables (predictor variables) (Geffen et al. 2004; Pilot et al. 2006; Carmichael et al. 2007). The predictor variable sets include (i) X and Y coordinates (i.e. longitude and latitude); (ii) elevation; (iii) temperature (annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, temperature seasonality (standard deviation*100), maximum temperature of the warmest month and minimum temperature of the coldest month); (iv) precipitation (annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality (standard deviation*100), precipitation of the wettest quarter, precipitation of the driest quarter, precipitation of the warmest quarter and precipitation of the coldest quarter) and (v) ecoregion (coded as nine dummy variables). The temperature and precipitation variables represent 11 of the 19 BIOCLIM variables from WORLDCLIM (version 1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005), interpolated to 1-km spatial resolution. The elevation data were also at 1-km resolution from WorldClim. We used the level 1

ecological regions of North America (Commission for Environmental Cooperation 1997). The relationship between the genetic distance matrix for n = 1675 individuals and each of the five sets of predictor variables was first analysed separately using dbRDA marginal tests with 999 unrestricted permutations of the genetic distance matrix. We also tested the relationship to each of the individual predictor variables, except for the ecoregion dummy variables which we only examined as a set. Next, partial dbRDA was performed for the elevation, temperature, precipitation and ecoregion predictor variable sets, having first fit X and Y coordinates as covariables as previously described. We repeated this analysis on the individual predictor variables. Both the marginal and partial dbRDAs were conducted in DISTLM v.5. Finally, we performed a stepwise forward selection procedure to identify the subset of variables or sets of
variables that provide the best model explaining genetic differences among individuals (Pilot et al. 2006; Carmichael et al. 2007). We used program DISTLM forward 1.3 (Anderson 2003), with significance assessed with 999 permutations of the multivariate residual matrix under the reduced model. Several of the predictor variables are themselves correlated, but this sequential approach allowed us to control for these correlations as the proportion of variation explained by each variable is conditional on the variables already included in the model.

transitions and four transversions) observed at 78 polymorphic sites across the 949-bp region. Overall, haplotype diversity = 0.917, nucleotide diversity = 0.007 and mean number of pairwise differences = 6.67. Both the Bayesian tree (Fig. 2a) and median-joining network (Fig. 2b) supported two main clades (Eastern: subclade A; Western: subclades C and D) that diverged from more ancestral haplotypes (subclade B). Haplotypes from subclades C and D on the network are separated by more than seven substitutions from any others. These C and D haplotypes also group together on the Bayesian tree with moderately high support (BPP = 0.90), and geographically are only found in the western USA (Fig. 3). Although subclades C and D each form monophyletic groups, they have BPP < 0.8 as well as overlapping geographic ranges in the west. Haplotypes from subclade A also form a well-supported group (BPP = 0.99), and they are found primarily in the eastern USA, although some are also scattered across
the west. Haplotypes from subclade B are basal on the tree and do not form a monophyletic clade. These ancestral haplotypes are less common and are primarily restricted to either the northwest or the southeast parts of the country (Fig. 3).
For individuals falling into the Eastern clade (subclade A; n = 594), FS was significantly negative (Table 1) and the mismatch distribution showed a distinct unimodal peak (Fig. 4a), indicative of recent demographic expansion. The test statistic, however, rejected the expansion model, although this is likely attributed to the large number of samples resulting in high power to detect even slight deviations from the model. Furthermore, the analysis estimated a significant change in population size from h0 to h1, as 95% CIs around h0 always included 0, whereas CIs around h1 did not. For individuals in the Western clade (subclades C and D; n = 424), FS was also significantly negative (Table 1), and the mismatch distribution did not differ signifi-

Based on estimates of s, the time of expansion was dated at approximately 28 500 ybp for the Eastern clade, and 67 000 ybp for the Western clade (Table 1). Using a lower estimate for u
pushed the dates back to approximately 80 000 and 185 000 ybp for Eastern and Western clades respectively, whereas a higher estimate of u moved the dates to 15 000 and 36 000 ybp.
Haplotype diversity (h) tended to decrease with increasing latitude (Fig. S2; Table S2, Supporting information), but the relationship was significant only when considering sample groups from the eastern USA (P < 0.05). Nucleotide diversity estimates did not show a strong latitudinal pattern overall or in either region (P > 0.05), but were notably smaller in the eastern USA (Fig. S2; Table S2, Supporting information). Estimates of pairwise FST values between the sample groups ranged from 0 to 1 and demonstrated a significant pattern of isolation by distance (r = 0.658, P = 0.001; Fig. S3a, Supporting information). Results of the SAMOVA indicated that the grouping with the highest FCT value (0.600, P < 0.001) differentiated eastern and western sample groups (K = 2; Fig. 3 and Fig. S1, Supporting information). For K > 2, the final genetic structure did not change except that with each increase in K, a single sample group was distinguished from the others; although FCT values were still significant, they declined with increasing K. Thus, we consider two populations (eastern vs. western sample groups) as the best characterization of mtDNA structure.

within the study area. Indeed, all 15 microsatellite markers deviated from HW equilibrium, each showing a significant deficit of heterozyogotes relative to randommating expectations (Table S1, Supporting information). In addition, 50 of the 105 locus pairs deviated from linkage equilibrium after sequential Bonferroni adjustments and all possible pairs had P-values < 0.05, despite the fact that these loci are unlikely to be physically linked (Table S1, Supporting information). Thus, this nonrandom association of alleles may also be attributed to population structure. In contrast to the total sample, the sample groups did not deviate significantly from HWE or LE. Measures of microsatellite genetic diversity (HE and AR) within sample groups decreased with increasing latitude (P < 0.05; Fig. S2; Table S2, Supporting information). Estimates of pairwise FST values ranged from 0 to 0.188 and demonstrated a significant pattern of isolation by distance (r = 0.716, P = 0.001; Fig. S3b, Supporting information). The individual-based genetic distances also demonstrated a weak but statistically significant pattern of isolation by distance (r = 0.243, P = 0.001).
Spatial principal components analysis
In sPCA, Jombart et al. (2008) recommend using an abrupt decrease in the eigenvalues to indicate the boundary between strong and weak structures. For this data set, the first eigenvalue was considerably larger than the others, and the second eigenvalue also stood out (Fig. 5a). The scores from the first principal component revealed a longitudinal (east–west) cline, differentiating bobcats in the eastern USA from those in the western half of the country, but with genotypes in the center of the range having less extreme scores than those nearer the coasts (Fig. 5b). This pattern exhibited a strong signal of positive spatial autocorrelation (I = 0.778) and represented a considerable proportion of the entire genetic variability (var = 0.383). The scores of the second principal component differentiated bobcats in the central USA from others (Fig. 5c) (I = 0.555; var = 0.185). Subsequent scores were more challenging to interpret (results not shown). The permutation test confirmed the existence of at least one global pattern (P = 0.001).
Bayesian clustering analysis
In the BAPS analysis, K = 10 was the optimal solution [L(K) = )87041.8; P = 0.927)] (Fig. 6). Similar to the sPCA, bobcats in eastern and western USA were differentiated, with a third population detected between them. BAPS recognized several additional populations in the northern USA, and clusters of individuals in southern Florida and southern California were also identified. The 10 inferred populations include coastal Oregon; western and southern

These populations did not deviate significantly from HWE or LE (Table 2), and all were significantly differentiated from one another based on pairwise FST values (Table S3, Supporting information). Results of the STRUCTURE analysis revealed patterns concordant with those detected by the other methods; they suggested hierarchical structure with two clusters at the first level corresponding to the east–west divergence observed through sPCA, and subsequent clusters largely matching those detected by BAPS (Figs S4–S6, Supporting information).
Hypothesized topographic barriers
Our examination of the influence of the Rocky Mountains included n = 221 samples, and the Mississippi
River included n = 367. Results of the partial dbRDAs indicated that neither the Rocky Mountains (F = 2.76, P = 0.063) nor the Mississippi River (F = 2.21, P = 0.122) was significantly associated with genetic differentiation after accounting for the influence of geographic distance. Visual examination of the BAPS cluster memberships also did not support either feature as a significant genetic barrier, as individuals located on either side of the given feature were often assigned to the same genetic cluster with high probability (Fig. 6). The BAPS clusters did, however, confirm the findings of earlier studies showing the influence of the Corn Belt (which separates Northern and LP Michigan populations from populations to the south), Straits of Mackinac (which separates the Northern and LP Michigan populations) and Cascade Range (which separates the coastal Oregon population from populations east of the mountains).

Ecological and environmental correlates
Each of the predictor variable sets we tested with dbRDA showed a significant relationship to genetic differentiation, explaining 4.69–11.57% of the total genetic variation, and all remained significantly associated even after accounting for the influence of geographic distance (i.e. by including X and Y coordinates as covariables; Table 3). Ecoregion accounted for the largest portion of genetic variation, followed closely by precipitation, and it was the first predictor set fit in the sequential model (Table 3). In total, the five predictor sets explained 16.02% of the total genetic variation. In testing the geographic and climate variables individually, longitude was the best single predictor (7.87%). Latitude, however, only accounted for 0.96% of the variation in the response matrix. Summer precipitation (precipitation of the warmest quarter) was the best predictor based on the conditional tests, accounting for an additional 1.18% of the variation on top of that already explained by spatial coordinates. In the sequential test, the X coordinate was the first vari-
able fit, followed by two precipitation variables and the Y coordinate (Table 3).
Discussion
Despite the potential for high levels of historical and contemporary gene flow in the bobcat, our data revealed significant substructure in this widespread generalist. The broad, underlying spatial pattern we observed was a longitudinal cline, with a sharp transition zone occurring along the Great Plains in the central USA. This pattern is evident in both mtDNA and microsatellite data, and is supported by different statistical approaches including SAMOVA, sPCA and Bayesian clustering analysis. Although an overall pattern of isolation by distance is also present, evidence indicates that the observed cline cannot be solely attributed to this process. For example although longitude was one of the most important predictor variables in the dbRDAs, latitude contributed very little to the models. If isolation by distance is the driving mechanism, variation in both spatial variables should contribute equally, given that
Ó 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

the sampling region covers a broad area in terms of both longitudinal and latitudinal distances. Furthermore, the mtDNA haplotype network and phylogenetic tree support two monophyletic and geographically structured lineages, primarily corresponding to eastern and western bobcats. Collectively, our results implicate historical climate oscillations as a significant factor shaping patterns of bobcat genetic variation.
Pleistocene refugia
Genetic clines, such as we observed, often result from genetic admixture at secondary contact zones, and postglacial recolonization from Pleistocene refugia is a common cause of secondary contact (Barton & Hewitt 1985). Hall & Kelson (1959) pointed out that a common zoogeographic pattern in North America is a distinction between eastern and western sister taxa. They postulated that this pattern stems from the aridification of the mid-continent region during Pleistocene interglacial periods, which separated species (particularly forest specialists) into disjunct eastern and western refugia from which they subsequently expanded. Indeed, phylogeographic evidence indicates that the Great Plains region is a common ‘suture zone’ for North American biota (Remington 1968; Swenson & Howard 2004).
Our data are consistent with the hypothesis of a historical mid-continent barrier and subsequent expansion from separate eastern and western refugia. In addition to the general east–west division we observed in the genetic data, the ancestral haplotypes (subclade B) are restricted to the western and southeastern USA, and are notably absent from the central USA. Following range expansions, ancestral haplotypes are generally less widespread than derived haplotypes and are likely to be centered on the origins of expansion (Templeton 2006), potentially pinpointing locations of refugia. Further supporting a Great Plains barrier during the Pleistocene, bobcat fossils from the range 35–10 ka have been found in several eastern and western states, as well as eastern Wyoming and southern Texas, but have not been found in the Great Plains (Graham & Lundelius 2010). Although bobcats are not a forest specialist per se, they do favor structure in their habitat, such as trees, shrubs or rocky outcroppings (Anderson & Lovallo 2003). Thus, widespread arid grasslands devoid of such structure (a landscape that no longer exists today) may have functioned as a historical barrier for this species.
Results of the demographic analyses, including significantly negative FS values and unimodal mismatch distributions, further support a scenario of expansion from glacial refugia. Our estimates of time since expansion are recent (measured in tens of thousands of years and not hundreds of thousands of years) and indicate a
more recent expansion in the eastern USA than the western. In addition, nucleotide diversity estimates were notably smaller in the eastern USA, consistent with a more recent expansion in this region (Zink et al. 2000) or with the existence of multiple refugia in the west (Fry & Zink 1998). We acknowledge that our estimates of time since expansion are sensitive to estimates of mutation rate, but we have interpreted them cautiously and find that they are consistent with, and do not rule out, the hypothesis of recent, postglacial expansion. Ideally, our results should be followed up with additional sequence data including nuclear markers to provide a more precise account of the sources, timing and routes of historical dispersal.
Founder effects
In addition to the east–west cline, we observed a number of putative genetic clusters in the northern portions of the bobcat’s range which may at least partially result from founder effects. The Great Lakes region and New England both were covered by ice during the last glacial maximum (LGM), which persisted until 􏰀10–15 ka. Once appropriate habitat became available, postglacial recolonization likely happened relatively quickly, as long-distance dispersers at the leading edge expanded into the region (i.e. the pioneer model; Hewitt 1996). Such a founding event leaves a signature of reduced genetic diversity (Hewitt 2000), which we observed in both the mtDNA and microsatellite data from these areas. Thus, contemporary gene flow has not erased the genetic signature of postglacial expansion in bobcats, although such homogenization has been observed in other vagile species (Smith et al. 2011).
Another distinct region was coastal Oregon⁄Washington. Based on mtDNA and microsatellite patterns, bobcats along the Pacific Northwest coast seem to have a unique evolutionary history from their more continental relatives. Here, persistent glacial ice in high elevation areas may have worked to isolate populations well after the LGM (18 ka), and the mountains may continue to restrict gene flow (Latch et al. 2009; Reding et al. 2011). However, the pattern may also be attributed to postPleistocene recolonization of the Pacific Northwest coastal areas from a postulated glacial refugium on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Shafer et al. 2010).
Anthropogenic and topographic effects
Superimposed on the longer term founder ⁄ glacial effects, divergence of bobcat populations in the Midwest and Northeast could be reinforced by recent habitat loss and extirpation. Although historically bobcats occurred throughout the USA, these predators were

extirpated from portions of the agricultural Midwest and heavily populated mid-Atlantic coastal region for most of the 20th century, and have only recently increased in abundance and distribution in these areas (Deems & Pursley 1978; Woolf & Hubert 1998). Anthropogenic influences, which appear to be most dramatic in these two eastern areas, may help to explain our finding that western bobcat populations are more homogeneous than eastern populations.
The BAPS clusters also confirmed the previously identified influence of the Corn Belt (separating the Northern and LP of Michigan bobcats from populations south of the agricultural zone), Straits of Mackinac (separating the Northern and the LP of Michigan populations) and Cascade Range (separating the coastal Oregon population from bobcats west of the mountains). However, we found no evidence for the role of the Mississippi River or Rocky Mountains in structuring this species at a broad scale.
Climate and ecological effects
An intriguing question is whether the bobcat suture zone in the Great Plains is merely the midpoint of glacial refugia, or if ongoing factors are involved in its formation and maintenance (Swenson 2006). In addition to secondary contact, genetic clines can result from adaption along an environmental gradient (Endler 1977). Today, the Great Plains region represents a major shift in climatic types, particularly with regard to a sharp precipitation gradient that separates the moist east from the arid west. Our dbRDA results indicated that climate variables—particularly precipitation—explained a small but significant portion of bobcat genetic differentiation. Thus, the observed genetic cline in bobcats may be maintained by niche divergence along an environmental gradient. We examined neutral genetic variation, however, and inferences about selective pressures would benefit from future examination of potentially adaptive genes.
We observed distinct genetic clusters in southern Florida and southern California. These areas may indeed be unique given their ecological distinctness, and the occurrence of some unique haplotypes in these areas supports such a hypothesis. However, sampling was aggregated in these areas, and clustering algorithms may be picking up on family structure (Anderson & Dunham 2008), or reflect population structure at a finer scale. We detected other congruencies between genetic clusters and ecoregions (e.g. divergence between the Central and Southeastern populations, and distinction of coastal Oregon bobcats), and ecoregions explained a significant portion of the genetic variation in the dbRDAs. Natal habitat-biased dispersal, whereby individuals preferentially disperse into habitat similar to that in
which they were born, may be a possible mechanism contributing to bobcat genetic structure (Davis & Stamps 2004). Although bobcats do not form social groups, which might facilitate behavioural divergences among individuals from different ecotypes, offspring do stay with their mothers for an extended period of time (9 months to 2 years; Anderson & Lovallo 2003), perhaps developing preferences for specific habitat or prey. The potential for habitat-specific divergence in this species should be further explored, for example by focusing radiotelemetry studies along ecotones to test whether dispersal movements are biased toward natal habitat type (e.g., Sacks et al. 2005).
Conclusions
This broad-scale survey of spatial genetic variation clearly indicates that despite possessing many characteristics predicted to limit genetic differentiation, bobcat population genetic structure exhibits complex temporal and spatial patterns. Our results not only suggest that historical processes are responsible for the main, underlying pattern, but they also indicate that environmental and anthropogenic forces have played a role in more recent time. With large sample sizes collected over a broad area, this study provides one of the most comprehensive pictures of neutral genetic patterns for a widespread North American species, providing a firm foundation for future work testing specific hypotheses related to, for example divergent selection across environmental gradients, comparative phylogeography or genetic impacts of climate change.
