Abstract
The phylogeny of South American spiny rats (Rodentia; Echimyidae) was studied using the exon 28 of the von Willebrand Factor nuclear gene (vWF). Sequences were analysed separately and in combination with a mitochondrial dataset (cyt b, 12S and 16S rRNAs) used in previous publications. The basal polytomy of echimyids was partially resolved and unexpected intergeneric clades were recovered. Thus, the intimate nested position of Myocastor within echimyids is evidenced. A well-supported clade is identiWed, including all the arboreal genera, and a group formed by Myocastor, Thrichomys, and Proechimys + Hoplomys. The clustering of Euryzygomatomys + Clyomys with Trinomys is also suggested. On the opposite, the phylogenetic position of Capromys as well as the relationships among arboreal genera remain unclear. Molecular divergence times were estimated using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock and suggest a Middle Miocene origin for most of modern genera. The ecomorphological diversiWcation of echimyids is discussed in the light of these new results and past environmental modiWcations in South America.

    1. Introduction
The South American spiny rats represent today the major radiation within Caviomorpha, with 18 genera (Emmons and Vucetich, 1998; Emmons et al., 2002; Lara et al., 1996; Leite, 2003; McKenna and Bell, 1997) and about 80 species grouped in the family Echimyidae. These small to medium-bodied rat-like rodents are distributed throughout all the tropical region in Neotropics

(Emmons and Feer, 1997). The majority of echimyids occurs in the Amazon Basin (Fig. 1) inhabiting lowland and montane rainforest (Dactylomys, Echimys, Makalata, Isothrix, Mesomys, Lonchothrix, and Proechimys). Three other genera (Olallamys, Diplomys, and Hoplomys) as well as several Proechimys species are restricted in the forest areas west of the Cordillera Central which encompasses Central America and northern regions of Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela (Fig. 1). The eight remaining genera are localised in the Brazilian subregion including Central-eastern Brazil, Paraguay, and Northeastern Argentina (Fig. 1). Some of them are found in tropical forests and marginally drier woodlands

(Kannabateomys, Phyllomys, Callistomys, and Trinomys) in the Atlantic forest biome whereas the others are poor-speciWc genera residing in grasslands (Carterodon, Clyomys, and Euryzygomatomys) and bushlands (Thrichomys) (Fig. 1). In addition to be the most species-rich caviomorph family, the Echimyidae have the greatest diversity of ecomorphological adaptations within hystricognath rodents. Whereas Proechimys, Hoplomys, Trinomys, and Thrichomys are ground-dwelling taxa, the three savanna genera, Carterodon, Clyomys, and Euryzygomatomys, actually exhibit features related to burrowing habits like high sociability, short tail, and small size (Eisenberg and Redford, 1999; Emmons and Feer, 1997). Moreover, all the other genera show specialized arboreal lifestyle. To clarify the evolutionary processes that generated this striking ecological diversity, a robust phylogenetic frame among echimyids is required. Unfortunately, previous published molecular phylogenies (Lara et al., 1996; Leite and Patton, 2002) provided star-phylogenies with few resolved intergeneric relationships, but highlighted the need for revising the current systematics of the Echimyidae.
Following McKenna and Bell’s classiWcation (1997), present-day echimyids are divided into four subfamilies. Dactylomyinae and Echimyinae exclusively include treedwelling taxa with, respectively, the bamboo rats (Dactylomys, Kannabateomys, and Olallamys) and the tree rats (Diplomys, Echimys, Isothrix, and Makalata). Recently,
the Atlantic tree rats (Phyllomys spp.; Emmons et al., 2002; Leite, 2003) as well as the Bahia-endemic painted tree-rat (Callistomys pictus; Emmons and Vucetich, 1998) were splitted from the Amazonian Echimys—C. pictus has been also placed as a species of Isothrix—and both elevated to generic level. On the basis of similar molar patterns, all terrestrial and burrowing genera as well as two arboreal taxa (Proechimys, Hoplomys, Thrichomys, Euryzygomatomys, Carterodon, Clyomys, Mesomys, and Lonchothrix) were clustered in Heteropsomyinae. This subfamily includes also all extinct West Indian genera although other authors separate them (e.g., Woods, 1993). In addition, recent morphological and molecular analyses (Lara et al., 1996; Leite, 2003) supported the recognition of generic level for Atlantic terrestrial spiny rats (Trinomys spp.). Finally, the monotypic Myocastorinae is represented by the coypu (Myocastor coypus), a big rodent adapted to semi-aquatic life that occurs in all southern South America. The systematic status of Myocastor is complex since it was alternatively referred to as capromyids (Corbet and Hills, 1991; Hall, 1981), elevated at familial level (Myocastoridae: e.g., Woods, 1982) or included in the Echimyidae (Patterson and Wood, 1982). Until recently, the bristle-spined porcupine Chaetomys subspinosus was considered as a member of echimyids and placed in its own subfamily, the Chaetomyinae (e.g., Woods, 1993). However, the analysis of the enamel structure (Martin, 1994) as well as the

provinces of South America.

replacement of the premolars documented by Carvalho (2000) deWnitively permitted the inclusion of this species within New World porcupines, the Erethizontidae. In addition, Echimyidae appear to be closely related to Capromyidae or hutias (Carvalho, 1999; Woods, 1982, 1993; Woods and Hermanson, 1985). Capromyids represent an entirely intra-Caribbean radiation of medium to big-sized rodents comprising the Wve genera Capromys, Geocapromys, Plagiodontia, Rhizoplagiodontia, and Isolobodon (McKenna and Bell, 1997). The latter two were exterminated in historical time after humans arrival (Nowak, 1991). Hutias inhabit fragments of subtropical forests where they forage both in the ground and trees (Nowak, 1991).
Using sequences of the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene, Lara et al. (1996) reconstructed the evolutionary history of 12 Echimyidae genera. Whereas the monophyly of the family and of most genera was strongly supported, most of supraspeciWc phylogenetic relationships were unresolved. These authors concluded in favour of the simultaneous divergence of most of extant echimyid genera (a “star-phylogeny” or “hard-polytomy” hypothesis) without rejecting a potential lack of resolving power of cytochrome b sequences. To test the star-phylogeny hypothesis, Leite and Patton (2002) sequenced two other mitochondrial genes (12S and 16S rRNAs), increasing the data matrix from 1140 to 2457 sites. Adding Capromys and Myocastor in the dataset, they did not obtain strong support for the monophyly of echimyids but rather found that the hutia and coypu belonged to the echimyid intergeneric polytomy. Therefore, they suggested the inclusion of Capromyidae and Myocastoridae within Echimyidae. However, despite the analysis of more characters and taxa, only low-level clades were recovered whereas the basal polytomy of echimyids persisted.
Consequently, we evaluate for the Wrst time the contribution of a slower-evolving, nuclear marker to the spiny rats phylogeny. Recent studies suggested that nuclear genes are less aVected by multiple substitutions than mitochondrial ones, and may represent complementary tools to reconstruct both deep-level (Springer et al., 2001) and familial-level (Steppan et al., 2004) phylogenies. We have chosen the exon 28 of the nuclear von Willebrand factor gene (vWF), a single-copy nuclear gene already used to investigate the phylogeny of mammals at various taxon levels: placentals (Porter et al., 1996; Springer et al., 1997), rodents (Huchon et al., 1999, 2002), and hystricognaths in particular (Huchon and Douzery, 2001; Huchon et al., 2000). Indeed, we show that the use of this nuclear exon adds resolution to the intergeneric polytomy and helps to better understand the systematic position of Myocastor. Moreover, we use the phylogenetic results to infer the evolution of ecomorphological adaptations among Echimyidae. In addition, we applied molecular dating in order to Wll the impor-
tant gap in the fossil record of echimyids and related taxa (e.g., McKenna and Bell, 1997). Because potential variations of the vWF evolutionary rate among lineages may hinder molecular clock inferences, the Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach developed by Thorne et al. (1998) and Kishino et al. (2001) was chosen to calculate divergence times. Moreover, this method incorporates the uncertainty of calibration points, and provides credibility intervals on divergence times among species. This approach has already permitted to highlight unsuspected biogeographical patterns within frogs (Bossuyt and Milinkovitch, 2001) and gave compatible results with the fossil record at various taxonomic levels (Douzery et al., 2004; Hassanin and Douzery, 2003). By correlating the estimates of divergence dates with climatic and geological events, we beneWted from an enlarged vision of the historical evolution of neotropical habitats and their fauna.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Species sampling
To study the phylogenetic relationships among genera of echimyids, 19 species were used representing 13 of the 19 extant genera recognized by McKenna and Bell (1997), and considering Trinomys (formerly Proechimys) and Phyllomys (formerly Echimys) as separate genera. Tissue samples were stored in the mammalian tissue collection of the “Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution de Montpellier” (CatzeXis, 1991). Our taxa set is very similar to the one of Leite and Patton (2002), with addition of the recently described Isothrix sinnamariensis (Vié et al., 1996). To reduce the potential instability of long branches in the trees, several species were included for some species-rich genera (Proechimys, Trinomys). The three traditionally recognized subfamilies as well as the three main ecomorphological groups (fossorial, grounddwelling, and arboreal) were represented by several species in our sampling. To evaluate the monophyly of Echimyidae, we included one representative for each of the other families of the Octodontoidea (i.e., Capromyidae, Ctenomyidae, Abrocomidae, and Octodontidae). As close but unambiguous outgroups, we chose the caviomorph species Chinchilla lanigera and Cavia porcellus (see, e.g., Huchon and Douzery, 2001). Taxonomy as well as specimens and vWF sequences used in this study are indicated in Table 1.
To perform combined analyses between vWF and mitochondrial markers, all mitochondrial sequences (cyt b, 12S and 16S rRNAs) were extracted from EMBL/ GenBank (Bonvicino et al., unpublished; Lara and Patton, 2000; Lara et al., 1996; Leite and Patton, 2002; Nedbal et al., 1994; Steiner et al., 2000) and aligned for one individual per species of echimyids and representatives

Note that the species identiWcation of the specimens of Trinomys follows Lara and Patton (2000), who corrected their earlier assignment of cyt b accession U34856 (Lara et al., 1996) of the name T. albispinis to a specimen of T. setosus (catalog number AL 3072 instead of to AL 3054).
2.2. Data acquisition and sequence alignment
We extracted DNAs from the 95% ethanol-preserved tissues according to Sambrook et al. (1989). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliWcations of the main part of the vWF exon 28 (1173 bp) were conducted according to Huchon et al. (1999). Two overlapping fragments (V1/ W2 of 850 bp and V2/W6 of 930 bp) were ampliWed. For most species, V1/W2 was replaced by V10/W13 (450 bp) with the following direct (V) and reverse (W) primers: V10 (5􏰂-TTAGTGCTACCACCCCATACCTGGAAG3􏰂) and W13 (5􏰂-GGCCCGATGCCCACTGGCATC
A-3􏰂). PCR products were puriWed from 1% agarose gels using Amicon Ultrafree-DNA columns (Millipore, Bedford, IN, USA) and sequenced on both strands using PCR primers with automatic sequencing (Big Dye Terminator cycle kit) on an ABI 310 (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). The 16 new sequences have been deposited in the EMBL databank. Accession numbers referring to all sequences used in this study are available in Table 1. The vWF matrix has been deposited in TreeBASE (http://www.treebase.org/treebase/) under accession numbers S1217, M2103, and M2104.
Sequences were manually aligned with the ED editor of the MUST package (Philippe, 1993). The alignment started at position 89 of the human sequence and nonsequenced positions were coded as missing data.
For combined analyses, we added the mitochondrial cyt b (1142 bp), 12S (884 bp) and 16S rRNAs (470 bp) to the vWF sequences, representing a supermatrix of 37 taxa and 3669 characters. Alignment of the 12S and 16S

rRNAs sequences was performed after taking into account secondary structure models (Burk et al., 2002; Springer and Douzery, 1996), and hypervariable regions located in some loops were removed prior to subsequent phylogenetic analyses. When a species was not available for a given marker, it was coded as missing data. This supermatrix of characters approach allowed (i) the incorporation of a greater biodiversity despite the lack of tissue sample and/or PCR signal for some taxa, and (ii) the combination of the potential signals of mitochondrial and nuclear characters at, respectively, low and high taxonomic levels.
2.3. Phylogenetic analyses
Maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses were conducted using, respectively, PAUP* version 4.0b10 (SwoVord, 2002) and MrBayes 3.04 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003). Hierarchical-likelihood ratio tests performed with Modeltest 3.04 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) determined the TrN model plus invariable sites and gamma (􏰃) distribution of variable sites as the simplest one that best Wts the vWF data set. However, to implement the same model of sequence evolution under PAUP, MrBayes, and PAML, the General Time Reversible option (GTR; Yang, 1994) was chosen, with eight discrete categories for the 􏰃 distribution (Yang, 1996). To reduce calculation times, we conducted our analyses in two steps. First, we used a heuristic search to estimate maximum-likelihood parameters on a neighbour-joining starting tree. Second, the previously estimated parameters were entered in a new search with tree bisection– reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. The robustness of nodes was estimated by ML bootstrap percentages after 100 replications using previously estimated parameters, NJ starting tree and TBR branch swapping.
To account for the diVerent evolutionary processes occurring at each of the three codon positions, Bayesian analyses were performed with one distinct GTR + 􏰃8 model per codon position, with unlinking of base frequencies, GTR, and 􏰃 parameters. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling was performed during 2,000,000 generations with Wve simultaneous chains. We used the default settings for the priors on topologies and GTR + 􏰃8 model parameters. Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) were calculated from trees that were sampled every 20 generations, after removing the 5000 Wrst trees as the “burn-in” stage.
As an alternative Bayesian measure of node reliability, we also computed Bayesian bootstrapped proportions (BPBay) as suggested by Waddell et al. (2002) and Douady et al. (2003). While time consuming, this approach allowed to discriminate between moderately and strongly supported nodes for which initial PP were more than 0.95. For adequately computing BPBay under our partitioned likelihood model, we independently gen-
erated 100 bootstrap pseudo-replicates from each of the three partitions (the three vWF codon positions) using SEQBOOT 3.6 in PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 2001). Then, for each concatenated bootstrap dataset, MCMCMC sampling of trees was performed as previously described for the original dataset under the three GTR + 􏰃8 partitioned model, except that trees were sampled every 100 generations for only 500,000 generations. A conservative one-half of the 5000 trees sampled from the posterior probability distribution was systematically discarded as the burnin, to maximize the probability that the chains reached stationarity in each bootstrap resampled data set (Douady et al., 2003). BPBay were obtained from the overall 50% majority rule consensus of the 100 £ 5000
D 500,000 saved trees.
Log-likelihoods of alternative topologies were statis-
tically compared to the one of the highest likelihood tree by the test of Kishino and Hasegawa (1989) applying the Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999) correction for multiple comparisons (SH test).
To reduce computing times, ML combined analysis, including the bootstrap search, was conducted using the recently described program PHYML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003). Because some taxa were not sampled for some genes, we chose a single GTR + 􏰃8 model for the analysis of the concatenated vWF and mitochondrial sequences.
2.4. Molecular dating
To investigate whether a global molecular clock applied to vWF amino acids, we used PAML (Yang, 1997), version 3.1, to conduct a likelihood ratio test between clock-like versus non-clock-like phylograms. We applied a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach on amino acids for the caviomorph vWF data set via DIVTIME version 5b (Kishino et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 1998). The method used to estimate divergence times allows the incorporation of paleontological constraints into the analyses. We did not select calibration points within Octodontoidea because of the ambiguous taxonomic status of most fossils (Vucetich and Kramarz, 2003; Vucetich and Verzi, 1996) and many gaps in the paleontological record. We consequently chose a single constraint: the radiation of Caviomorpha dated between 28.5 and 37 million years (Ma) (Wyss et al., 1993). This choice implied the inclusion in our data set of representatives of the whole evolutionary diversity occurring within Caviomorpha. Thus, we incorporated the vWF sequences from six species belonging to the major caviomorph families (Huchon and Douzery, 2001): Agoutidae (Agouti paca), Dasyproctidae (Dasyprocta leporina), Hydrochaeridae (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris), Erethizontidae (Erethizon dorsatum, Coendou melanurus), and Dinomyidae (Dinomys branickii). Because the DIVTIME procedure requires an additional

606 T. Galewski et al. / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 34 (2005) 601–615
outgroup, the sequence from Heterocephalus glaber (Hystricognathi; Phiomorpha) was added.
In order to estimate divergence times, we used the tree topology resulting from the ML analysis for the relationships within octodontoids. Huchon and Douzery’s (2001) results provided the phylogenetic relationships among non-echimyid taxa. This topology resulted in four well-supported clades within Caviomorpha: the Cavioidea (Agoutidae + Dasyproctidae + Hydrochaeridae +
Caviidae), the Erethizontoidea (Erethizontidae), the Chinchilloidea (Chinchillidae + Dinomyidae), and the Octodontoidea. Because Huchon and Douzery (2001) showed that phylogenetic relationships among the four main evolutionary lineages of Caviomorpha remain unresolved, we evaluated the impact of the caviomorph rooting on the dating estimates among echimyids by performing the same DIVTIME analyses under each of the 15 possible topologies connecting the four clades.
The molecular dating was run in two steps. First, the program ESTBRANCHES recalculated the branch lengths of the constrained topology and the corresponding variance–covariance matrix from amino acid data sets. We applied the JTT model (Jones et al., 1992) of empirical amino acid replacement. Second, the program DIVTIME used this variance–covariance matrix to run a Markov chain and calculate divergence times
of nodes, standard-deviations (SD), and 95% credibility intervals (Cred. I.). After a “burn-in” stage of 100,000 cycles, the Markov chain was sampled 10,000 times every 100 cycles. We used the following priors of Gamma distributions for the model of rate autocorrelation: 31.5 Myr (SD D 15.75 Myr) for the expected number of time units between tip and root if there has been no constraint on node times, 0.24 (SD D 0.12) for the rate at root node for the amino acid replacements, and 0.032 (SD D 0.032) for the Brownian motion constant that described the degree of rate autocorrelation along the descending branches of the tree. We chose the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 Myr) for the highest possible number of time units between tip and root. The prior values were the same for all analyses performed.

In the Bayesian tree, numbers are, respectively, posterior probabilities (PP) when superior to 0.95, and Bayesian bootstrapped values (BPBay) when superior to 50%.

The scale is given in substitutions per site (s. p. s.).

recovered in the Bayesian tree with high posterior probabilities (PP > 0.95) and strong bootstrap PP values (BPbay > 74). Thus, there is strong evidence for the monophyly of Capromys + Echimyidae (BPML D BPbay D 100, and PP D 1.00) contrasting with the weak support provided for the Echimyidae monophyly (BPML D 62). Within echimyids, our analyses show a high-level clade encompassing all genera (including Myocastor) except Clyomys, Euryzygomatomys, and Trinomys species. This association is well-supported (BPML D 89; BPbay D 87; PP D 1.00) and alternative topologies inducing its paraphyly are signiWcantly worse than the ML tree (Shimodaira–Hasegawa test: PSH D 0.04). Clyomys + Euryzygomatomys (BPML D BPbay D 100; PP D 1.00), Dactylomys + Kannabateomys (BPML D 76;BPbay D 74; PP D 1.00), and (Echimys + Phyllomys) + Makalata (BPML D 87; BPbay D 85; PP D 1.00) represent other clearly identiWed intergeneric clades.
A sister-group relationship between Trinomys and (Clyomys + Euryzygomatomys) is suggested in ML and
Bayesian topologies. Although the ML bootstrap value is not negligible (BPML D 71), the potential paraphyly of this clade is not rejected (PSH D 0.22). Two other intergeneric clades are recovered with moderate support: (i) Myocastor + Thrichomys + Proechimys (BPML D 36; BPbay D 44; PP D 0.96), with Myocastor branching at the base, and (ii) Echimys + Phyllomys (BPML D 57).
The only diVerence observed between the ML and Bayesian topologies involves the position of the clade formed by Myocastor, Thrichomys, and Proechimys. It is sister group of a clade encompassing all the arboreal genera—Isothrix, Dactylomys + Kannabateomys, Mesomys, and Makalata + (Echimys + Phyllomys)—in the ML tree (Fig. 2). On the opposite, in the Bayesian tree, Myocastor + (Thrichomys + Proechimys) emerged within the arboreal group as the sister clade of Makalata+ (Echimys + Phyllomys), leading to the paraphyly of arboreal genera. However, neither of these ML and Bayesian branching patterns of arboreal taxa is supported.

The phylogenetic results which are incongruent with the current classiWcation and/or previous studies (Leite and Patton, 2002; McKenna and Bell, 1997; Woods, 1993) have been evaluated by the way of SH tests against the ML tree. A sister-clade relationship has been suggested between Myocastor and Capromys, but the resulting topology is worse than the ML tree (PSH D 0.01). Within echimyids, two subfamilies currently recognized (McKenna and Bell, 1997) do not appear monophyletic: the Heteropsomyinae and the Echimyinae (Fig. 3). Whereas the monophyly of heteropsomyines is strongly rejected (PSH D 0.01), the inclusion of Isothrix within the clade formed by the other echimyines included here (Echimys, Phyllomys, and Makalata) cannot be statistically rejected (PSH D 0.35).
3.1.2. Combined analyses
ML (Fig. 3) and Bayesian (not shown) topologies resulting from the combination of the nuclear vWF and the three mitochondrial genes (cyt b, 12S and 16S rRNAs) are congruent, and they are highly similar to the vWF phylogenies previously presented. However, thanks to the addition of taxa not included in the vWF matrix, new intergeneric clades are identiWed: Hoplomys +
Proechimys (BPML D 100; PP D 1.00) and Lonchothrix + Mesomys (BPML D 100; PP D 1.00). The inclusion of several species of Proechimys and Trinomys allowed to test the monophyly of these speciose genera. The Trinomys lineage appears clearly monophyletic with two clades deeply divergent: one including the species T. gratiosus,
T. dimidiatus, and T. iheringi, and the other formed by the species T. eliasi, T. paratus, T. yonenagae, and T. setosus. The monophyly of the genus Proechimys is also recovered but with moderate support (BPML D 49; PP D 1.00).
In agreement with the vWF ML tree, the monophyly of arboreal genera is found but with much higher support (BPML D 83; PP D 1.00). Other intergeneric clades already recovered in the ML topology based on vWF sequences receive stronger support in the combined analysis: (i) the monophyly of Thrichomys, Myocastor, Hoplomys, and Proechimys (BPML D 80; PP D 1.00); (ii) Dactylomys + Kannabateomys (BPML D 100; PP D 1.00); and (iii) Echimys + Phyllomys (BPML D 87; PP D 1.00).
DiVerences in topology relative to the vWF tree are weakly supported and involve (i) the subdivision of the arboreal clade into two groups: Lonchothrix + Mesomys sister group to Isothrix (BPML D 58; PP D 0.81), and Dactylomys + Kannabateomys clustered with Makalata +
(Echimys + Phyllomys) (BPMLD56; PPD0.70); (ii) a sister-clade relationship between Capromys and (Euryzygomatomys + Clyomys) recovered in the ML analysis but not in the Bayesian one; and (iii) the basal position of Thrichomys within the clade encompassing Myocastor, Hoplomys, and Proechimys (BPML D 80; PP D 0.87).

the vWF protein did not appear sensitive to the location of the caviomorph root. The 15 possible locations of the root among cavioids, erethizontoids, chinchilloids, and octodontoids involve a maximum change of divergence time estimates of 2.7 Ma, which is less than the standard deviation on those estimates (Table 2).
The splits of echimyid into four major clades—capromyids, fossorial genera, Trinomys, and all remaining echimyids including Myocastor (Fig. 2)—would have occurred in the late Early Miocene around 17.1–18.2 Ma (Table 2). Most of modern echimyid genera (Trinomys, Thrichomys, Myocastor, Proechimys, Mesomys, Isothrix, and Makalata) seem to have diverged in a relative short laps of time in the Middle Miocene around 13 Ma (11.5– 14.5Ma). The relaxed molecular clock also suggests more recent and simultaneous splits, around 10 Ma, for two pairs of genera: Echimys–Phyllomys and Dactylomys–Kannabateomys. All intrageneric speciation events as well as the divergence between Clyomys and Euryzygomatomys would have occurred during the Pliocene (estimates range: 2.7–5.5 Ma; Table 2)
4. Discussion
4.1. Phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy
4.1.1. Relationships among hutias, spiny rats, and coypu
A phylogeny of Octodontoidea families based on the combination of nuclear (growth hormon receptor; GHR) and mitochondrial (12S rRNA) gene sequences has been published by Honeycutt et al. (2003). They observed that Abrocomidae emerged Wrst, followed by Octodontidae +
Ctenomyidae, sister to Myocastoridae + Echimyidae. On the opposite, both vWF and combined data set failed to resolve relationships among octodontoid families (Figs. 2 and 3). A weak phylogenetic signal contained in vWF sequences for these particular nodes and the lack of diverse outgroups could explain such a polytomy.
Our analyses show a strongly supported clade including echimyids, Capromys, and Myocastor, the latter being nested within the spiny rats subtree. This result is in agreement with previous molecular phylogenies although the internal position of Myocastor was unexpected due to the lack of echimyid representatives (Huchon and Douzery, 2001; Nedbal et al., 1994). The two other possibilities for connecting Myocastor, Capromys, and echimyids have been already suggested in previous studies. Woods and Hermanson (1985) proposed a phylogeny based on myological data in which Myocastor fell at the base of a clade regrouping capromyids and echimyids. On the contrary, Leite and Patton’s (2002) analyses of mitochondrial genes with more Echimyidae taxa found high support for a clade associating Myocastor and Capromys, and proposed their inclusion in the Echimyidae family.
Despite strong evidence provided in Leite and Patton’s (2002) study for Myocastor sister to Capromys, such a clade is rejected in our vWF and combined analyses. To test the validity of the vWF sequence of Myocastor—an individual trapped in Europe, descending from animals introduced outside their native range in South America—included in our dataset, we partially sequenced the same exon (ca. 500 bp) but from a specimen collected in South America. The two sequences were perfectly identical, highlighting their authenticity. Then, we re-examined the alignment from which the analyses of Leite and Patton (2002) were conducted. Actually, the 12S rRNA sequences of Myocastor and Capromys were misaligned in their data matrix, although the raw sequences published in Genbank are correct. The alleged sister-group relationship between these two genera is not supported when sequences are correctly aligned. When cyt b, 12S and 16S rRNAs are analyzed together under parsimony, Capromys comes out as sister to the remaining echimyids including Myocastor, which forms a clade sister to Proechimys + Hoplomys, as shown with the present paper. The conclusions of Leite and Patton (2002, p. 460) that Capromys and Myocastor are sister groups, and the clade Echimyidae must include both Capromys and Myocastor are therefore incorrect. The corrected mitochondrial data of Leite and Patton (2002) actually gives support to McKenna and Bell’s (1997) classiWcation, which places Myocastor within the family Echimyidae. However, unlike the latter classiWcation, the internal position of Myocastor, well supported in vWF and combined analyses, does not justify the recognition of a subfamilial rank for this taxon. Considering its semi-aquatic life, social behaviour, and large size, the phylogenetic position of Myocastor within echimyids appears surprising and highlights the wide range of ecomorphological forms evolved within this family. Moreover, the position of Capromys remains unclear (Figs. 2 and 3), and we cannot reject Woods’s (1989) hypothesis that capromyids actually derived from an ancestral stock of echimyids.
4.1.2. Relationships within Echimyidae
The addition of vWF sequences to the mitochondrial data set partially elucidates the intergeneric polytomy within echimyids, despite the persistence of several unresolved nodes. Whereas the combination of three mitochondrial markers (Leite and Patton, 2002) began to resolve some intergeneric clades, the nuclear vWF was able to identify higher-level groupings. Nuclear and mitochondrial genes seem to represent complementary tools to reconstruct the evolutionary history of spiny rats.
Several clades supported in prior mitochondrial analyses (Lara et al., 1996; Leite and Patton, 2002) are recovered in the vWF tree (Fig. 2). Clyomys and Euryzygomatomys form a very well-supported clade,

probably joined by the other burrowing genus not included in the taxa set, Carterodon, as revealed by morphological analyses (Carvalho, 1999). Among arboreal genera, we found new evidence for a sister-clade relationship between Dactylomys and Kannabateomys. These two genera share similar traits of life history, with the same aYnities for bamboo patches in rainforests (Emmons, 1981; Emmons and Feer, 1997). Their current repartition in two disjointed areas—Amazon Basin for Dactylomys and Atlantic Forest for Kannabateomys—suggests a vicariant origin. Echimys, Phyllomys, and Makalata are clustered in a strongly supported clade conWrming the systematics and their placement in the subfamily Echimyinae (McKenna and Bell, 1997; Woods, 1993). The Amazonian Echimys and Eastern Brazilian Phyllomys represent ecologically equivalent genera (Emmons and Feer, 1997) and, as suggested for the bamboo rats, they could result from a vicariant speciation event.
Analyses including vWF sequences (alone or in combination) recover additional higher-level groupings. First, echimyids are splitted into two main clades: Trinomys, Clyomys, and Euryzygomatomys on one hand, and all remaining genera on the other hand. Therefore, the polyphyly of the Heteropsomyinae is conWrmed (Fig. 3). Heteropsomyines were clustered on the basis of a similar ancestral narrow-fold molar pattern (sensu Patton and Reig, 1989), also recovered in Oligocene taxa (Vucetich et al., 1997), but recently shown to have independently evolved in diVerent clades (Vucetich and Kramarz, 2003).
Formerly considered as two subgenera (e.g., McKenna and Bell, 1997; Woods, 1993), the Atlantic (Trinomys) and Amazonian (Proechimys) terrestrial spiny rats are not closely related as suggested by mitochondrial genes. They should be regarded as separate genera (Lara et al., 1996; Leite and Patton, 2002). The present work gives additional evidence that Proechimys and Trinomys are deeply unrelated and represent among the most distant evolutionary lineages within echimyids (Figs. 2 and 3). These results are incongruent with the hypothesis of a vicariant origin for these two taxa (Moojen, 1948). The strong morphological and ecological similarities observed between the two genera could be the result of convergent evolution due to equivalent selective pressures in similar wooded habitats. However, and according to Lara and Patton (2000), many morphological features that join them appear to be shared ancestral characters. Trinomys and Proechimys could be thus morphologically very close to the ancestor of modern echimyids: a forest ground-dwelling spiny rat.
The well-supported clade, in both ML and Bayesian analyses, including arboreal taxa, several terrestrial taxa (Thrichomys, Proechimys, and Hoplomys), and the semiaquatic Myocastor was unexpected. Non-arboreal genera (Myocastor, Thrichomys, Hoplomys, and Proechimys) apparently form a monophyletic group (Figs. 2 and 3). The distinct area-ranges of these four genera (Southern
South America, Eastern Brazilian region, West of Central Cordillera, and Amazon Basin) suggest vicariant speciations. Even if they are ground-dwelling, these taxa present strongly dissimilar morphological features probably resulting from adaptation to diVerent habitats: tropical forest (Proechimys and Hoplomys), dry and bushy areas (Thrichomys), and wetlands (Myocastor). Thrichomys thus appears unrelated to Clyomys and Euryzygomatomys, unlike previous suggestions (Verzi et al., 1995; Vucetich et al., 1997), which implies at least two diVerent origins for echimyids occurring in the dry open environments of Central Brazil.
The monophyly of arboreal taxa is supported by the combined analysis (Fig. 3). For this node, the combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers could have a synergetic eVect in summing the weak phylogenetic signal hold by each molecular marker. It would be thus likely to consider a single apparition of morphological adaptations for climbing in the common ancestor of tree-dwelling echimyids. On the contrary, the Bayesian topology which provides a sister-clade relationship between some arboreal (Echimys, Phyllomys, and Makalata) and non-arboreal taxa (Myocastor, Thrichomys, Proechimys), implies a less parsimonious scenario. Indeed, the arboreality would be evolved two or more times, or adaptations for this particular way of life would be reversed in the ground-dwelling clade.
The phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved among the four clades of arboreal genera already identiWed in previous analyses (Lara et al., 1996; Leite and Patton, 2002): Mesomys + Lonchothrix; Isothrix; Dactylomys + Kannabateomys; and Makalata +
(Echimys + Phyllomys). However, Isothrix never appears sister clade of the group formed by Makalata, Echimys, and Phyllomys probably involving the Echimyinae polyphyly. This result was previously suggested by morphological analyses that concluded to incongruent results about the monophyly of this subfamily (Carvalho, 1999; Emmons et al., 2002).
All genera here represented by several species appear monophyletic as previously indicated (Da Silva and Patton, 1993; Lara and Patton, 2000; Lara et al., 1996; Leite and Patton, 2002; Patton et al., 1994). With a larger taxon sampling within Echimyidae, we conWrm that Trinomys is monophyletic and contains highly divergent species (Lara and Patton, 2000). About phylogenetic relationships among Isothrix species, the branching pattern observed (Fig. 3) remains questionable on account of the lack of homologous sites between I. pagurus and I. sinnamariensis in the combined data-matrix (only sequences of cyt b for I. pagurus and vWF for I. sinnamariensis were available).
4.2. Estimates of divergence times
Compared to paleontological data, our results provide more recent dates for the apparition of modern

Octodontoidea families. With remains from Late Oligocene deposits (Deseadan SALMA: 29.0–24.5 Ma; McKenna and Bell, 1997; Vucetich and Verzi, 1996; Vucetich et al., 1999) referred to echimyids and octodontids, these two families were regarded as among the oldest extant families of Caviomorpha. However, according to molecular dating, the lineage leading to Capromys and extant echimyids diverged several million years later in the Early Miocene (22.4 § 3.9 Ma; Table 2) suggesting that Oligocene and extant taxa are not closely related. Supporting our results, the taxonomic status of the ancient representatives of both families was often considered as doubtful (Vucetich and Verzi, 1996; Vucetich et al., 1999). Moreover, recent cladistic analyses of dental and mandibular characters did not conclude to a close relationship between extinct taxa and modern octodontoids, and proposed that characters uniting them were independently acquired (Vucetich and Kramarz, 2003).
Molecular divergence times of lower-level nodes are more concordant with paleontological data. Indeed, the Capromyidae/Echimyidae split dated at 18.2 § 4 Myr is in agreement with the oldest recovered fossil of capromyids from the middle Early Miocene (MacPhee and Iturralde-Vinent, 1995; MacPhee et al., 2003). The Middle Miocene age provided for the divergence of most of extant echimyid genera is not either in conXict with fossil data. Actually, most of modern genera are known only since the Late Pleistocene (McKenna and Bell, 1997). However, remains assigned to Thrichomys and extinct taxa apparently closely related to Clyomys and Euryzygomatomys have been recovered in Late Miocene deposits [Huayquerian SALMA: 6.8–9.0 Myr; Verzi et al., 1994, 1995]. In spite of the uncertainty of taxonomic status of these fossils, the Late Miocene could thus represent a strict minimum age for the origin of Thrichomys and semi-fossorial genera. The Middle Miocene diversiWcation of echimyids suggested by our analysis therefore appears in agreement with fossil record.
Finally, the Pliocene-ages provided for the intrageneric splitting events within Trinomys, Proechimys, Mesomys, Isothrix, and Makalata conform to other molecular data. Indeed, previous studies using molecular clock or genetic divergences highlighted a pre-Pleistocene diVerentiation for most of modern species of Trinomys, Proechimys, Makalata, Dactylomys, and Mesomys (Da Silva and Patton, 1993; Lara and Patton, 2000; Patton et al., 1994).
The Bayesian estimates of divergence times for echimyids and allies are sensibly older than dates provided with local and global molecular clock (Huchon and Douzery, 2001; Leite and Patton, 2002). For instance, using local clocks, Huchon and Douzery (2001) dated the divergence between Capromys and echimyids at 7–10Ma. Incongruences observed between the two sets of molecular data can be attributed to few echimyid
representatives in Huchon and Douzery’s (2001) study. Morevover, Huchon and Douzery (2001) suggested that the molecular clock might not click regularly along Echimyidae + Capromyidae lineage, implying less accurate estimates of splitting times under the method assuming local constancy of evolutionary rates. The divergence dates estimated within echimyids are also quite older than those found by Leite and Patton (2002). Using cyt b third codon position substitutions for estimating branch lengths and the Late Miocene (Huayquerian, 6.8–9.0Ma) record of Thrichomys (McKenna and Bell, 1997), they observed that a large part of the cladogenesis of extant echimyids happened during the Late Miocene. However, as speciWed by the authors, the taxonomic status of this fossil is doubtful (Reig, 1989; Verzi et al., 1995) and the calibration represents strict minimum age for the origin of extant echimyid genera.
4.3. Evolutionary and biogeographical implications of the spiny rats phylogeny
The paucity of data on the distribution of fossil forms of echimyids as well as the uncertainties on the reconstructions of landforms and habitats of South America over the past 35 million years induce speculative biogeographical implications. However, the combination of one better-resolved phylogeny and estimates of divergence times among spiny rats represent a Wrst step in the understanding of the impact of Late Tertiary environmental changes on the evolutionary history of these neotropical rodents.
4.3.1. Colonisation of West Indies
Capromyids currently represent the single lineage of caviomorph rodents in the West Indies. Two other families, Echimyidae (Heteropsomyinae) and Heptaxodontidae, are known to have occurred in the archipelago until their recent extinction (Nowak, 1991). However, the date of arrival of these taxa and the number of immigration events remain unknown. It has been suggested that all West Indian caviomorph rodents (extinct and still living) formed a monophyletic lineage, supposing a single ancestral colonization from South America (Woods, 1989). Some geological data suggest that South American fauna reached West Indies around the Early Oligocene thanks to a land bridge between the Greater Antilles and northern South America (Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee, 1999). However, molecular dating support a more recent origin for capromyids, in the Early Miocene, which is in agreement with fossil data (MacPhee and Iturralde-Vinent, 1995) and previous hypothesis (Woods, 1989). Then, among West Indian caviomorphs, at least capromyids may not Wt the timing of arrival to the Caribbean implied by Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee’s (1999) hypothesis. Moreover, there is no fossil older than the Early Miocene (Hedges, 1996) for

other West Indian lineages of Vertebrates (boid snakes, iguanid lizards, and platyrrhines Primates), possibly indicating simultaneous colonization events for all these taxa.
4.3.2. The Central-eastern Brazilian echimyids
Phylogenetic reconstructions and molecular dating suggest the early origin of the semi-fossorial ecomorphotype within echimyids. Such traits of life could represent adaptations to the expansion of grasslands in South America during the Miocene (Pascual and Jaureguizar, 1990). Moreover, a sister-clade relationship is suspected between semi-fossorial genera and Trinomys (Figs. 2 and 3). This unexpected branching pattern appears less surprising when the current area-range of these two groups is considered. Indeed, both occur in the Brazilian subregion although they are found in diVerent habitats, forests (Trinomys) or savanna-like areas (Clyomys, Carterodon). As many species of Trinomys, Euryzygomatomys occurs along the Atlantic Forest but it occupies open habitats within this domain. Such a sister-clade relationship could suggest an Early or Middle Miocene (Table 2) diVerentiation of the Eastern Brazilian fauna. A vast continental sea was assumed to occur in Northern South America during the Miocene (Räsänen et al., 1995), leading to the isolation of vast extensive landmasses (Nores, 1999; Webb, 1995) and associate faunas. However, divergent opinions about the extent and the age of this inland sea (Hoorn, 1996; Paxton and Crampton, 1996) prevent clear biogeographical conclusions.
The other extant Eastern-Brazilian echimyids are more recent components of the Brazilian fauna according to estimates of divergence times (Table 2). The lineage leading to Thrichomys diverged more recently (ca. 13 Ma). Interestingly, Thrichomys and the semi-fossorial Clyomys and Euryzygomatomys are suspected to have occurred in Central Argentina during the Late Miocene (Vucetich et al., 1997). Thus, components of the eastern Brazilian fauna could have been originally distributed in a broader area-range as it was periodically the case during the warmer periods of the Pleistocene (Vucetich and Verzi, 2002; Vucetich et al., 1997). The competition with octodontids and ctenomyids, better-adapted to arid environments, could have played a crucial role in the extinction of echimyids in Southern South America (Verzi et al., 1994).
Our molecular data show that at least two of the three arboreal echimyid genera endemic to the Atlantic Forest (Callistomys was not included in our study), simultaneously diverged from their Amazonian relatives (Table 2). The same pattern of speciation found for the origin of Phyllomys and Kannabateomys suggests a major rupture in the continuity of the forest domain in the Eastern Brazilian Region as previously suggested (Leite and Patton, 2002). The divergence times found with the relaxed molecular clock (10.3 § 3.1 Ma for Echimys/Phyllomys
and 9.5 § 3.1 Ma for Dactylomys/Kannabateomys) coincide with the most important drop in the sea level of the Late Tertiary (Haq et al., 1987). This marine regression event could have been correlated with climatic changes in South America, implying the reduction of moist forests in Eastern Brazil.
The deep origin of Eastern Brazilian lineages indicate that the dry corridor of open vegetation of the Central Brazilian area has represented an important barrier to echimyid migration between Amazon and Atlantic forests domains for a long time, contrary to many other groups of small non-volant mammals (Costa, 2003).
4.3.3. The origin of arboreal and semi-aquatic taxa
According to the phylogeny of the Octodontoidea, it appears more parsimonious to assume that Wrst echimyids were ground-dwelling rodents. Under this assumption, all the other ecomorphological types would have simultaneously appeared in the Middle Miocene around 14.5 Ma according to molecular dating. If the burrowing-life is probably an adaptation to the expansion of open environments, it seems less easy to identify the environmental causes possibly triggering the emergence of arboreal and semi-aquatic lineages. Interestingly, the initiation of the vast hydrographical system of Amazon river occurred around 14.5Ma (Hoorn, 1993, 1994a,b; Hoorn et al., 1995). Before the full development of this transcontinental drainage system during the Late Miocene, Hoorn (1996) and Hoorn et al. (1995) speciWed the occurrence of a Xuvio-lacustrine system with marine incursions around 14 Ma. The environment in Northwestern Amazonia was thus dominated by extensive wetlands and riverine forests (Hoorn, 1994a,b), and the whole tropical rainforest was described as a vast “varzea.” With the apparition of vast zones of inundated forests in the Amazonian Basin, innovations allowing to climb and forage in the canopy could have been positively selected. Arboreality may have been a “keyinnovation” in the evolutionary history of echimyids allowing the occupation of new ecological niches. Actually, arboreal echimyids Wll diVerent kinds of forests (Emmons and Feer, 1997) with for instance genera mainly related to varzea (Makalata), bamboo patches (Dactylomys) or mature primary forest (Echimys). Speciation events could have occurred in a short laps of time explaining the intergeneric polytomy recovered by molecular data. On the other hand, the semi-aquatic life of the nutria could represent an other adaptation to the extensive wetlands that have occurred during the Middle Miocene. However, the current area-range of the nutria may involve that it emerged farther south in South America. Thus, Myocastor could also constitute one of the extant representative of the Miocene radiation performed in the southern plains of the con-

tinent (Vucetich et al., 1997, 1999), a hypothesis supported by its clustering with Thrichomys (and Proechimys + Hoplomys). ConWned to wetlands, the nutria was not aVected by the increasing aridity of southern South America. In the same area, other echimyids became extinct during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, possibly due to the competition with octodontids and ctenomyids (Verzi et al., 1994).
The use of a nuclear DNA marker (vWF), alone or in combination, provides signiWcant phylogenetic signal to resolve intergeneric relationships within echimyids. In addition to conWrm the inadequacy between the current taxonomy and the molecular-based phylogenetic hypotheses, our main results involve (1) the intimate nested position of Myocastor within echimyids; (2) the subdivision of echimyids s.l. into three (maybe four) main clades, including capromyids, fossorial genera, (and) Trinomys, and all the other echimyids including Myocastor. Further studies including more representatives of the Capromyidae and more nuclear genes are required to conclude whether or not these insular rodents belong to Echimyidae. The addition of representatives of morphologically well-diVerentiated lineages (e.g., Diplomys, Callistomys, “Echimys” semivillosus) would also corroborate the present results and provide increased resolution for the echimyid intergeneric relationships. Moreover, our molecular dating seems to conWrm that paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental variations during the Miocene of South America have played a crucial role on the ecomorphological diversiWcation of at least one group of mammals: the spiny rats.
