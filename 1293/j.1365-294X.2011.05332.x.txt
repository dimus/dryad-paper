Abstract
Rafting has long been invoked as a key marine dispersal mechanism, but biologists have thus far produced little genetic evidence to support this hypothesis. We hypothesize that coastal species associated with buoyant seaweeds should experience enhanced population connectivity owing to rafting. In particular, invertebrates strongly associated with the buoyant bull-kelp Durvillaea antarctica might be expected to have lower levels of population-genetic differentiation than taxa mainly exploiting nonbuoyant substrates. We undertook a comparative genetic study of two codistributed, congeneric chiton species, assessing population connectivity at scales of 61–516km, using ‡186 polymorphic AFLP loci per species. Consistent with predictions, population-genetic differentiation was weaker in the kelp-associated Sypharochiton sinclairi than in the rock-associated S. pelliserpentis. Additionally, while we found a significant positive correlation between genetic and oceanographic distances in both chiton species, the correlation was stronger in S. pelliserpentis (R2 = 0.28) than in S. sinclairi (R2 = 0.18). These data support the hypothesis that epifaunal taxa can experience enhanced population-genetic connectivity as a result of their rafting ability.

Introduction
Assessing genetic connectivity between isolated benthic populations has long been an important topic in marine biology, with particular emphasis on gene flow mediated by planktonic larvae (reviewed by Kinlan & Gaines 2003; Cowen & Sponaugle 2009). In addition to larval dispersal, several recent analyses have also pointed to the potential role of passive transportation of adults by rafting as an important long-distance dispersal mechanism for coastal marine species (Waters & Roy 2004; Donald et al. 2005; Nikula et al. 2010; Fraser et al. 2011). Large buoyant seaweeds (e.g. Durvillaea, Fucus, Macrocystis, Ecklonia) might be particularly important dispersal vectors given their ability to raft following detachment. The dispersal ability of rafting macroalgae

is evidenced by their population-genetic similarity across large distances (Coleman & Brawley 2005; Muhlin et al. 2008; Coleman & Kelaher 2009). In addition to their direct effects on macroalgal biogeography and connectivity, such dispersal events may also promote ‘hitch-hiking’ of associated invertebrate epifaunal communities (Smith & Simpson 2002; Fraser et al. 2011). In particular, recent phylogeographic studies of Durvillaea antarctica holdfast epifauna imply that macroalgal rafting presents a powerful means of long-distance dispersal for a wide variety of sedentary animal taxa (Nikula et al. 2010; Fraser et al. 2011). However, few studies have so far attempted to quantify the effects of rafting dispersal on population connectivity of macroalgal epifauna (but see Nikula et al. 2011).
Here, we present a comparative analysis to help elucidate the population-genetic effects of habitat association with a keystone rafting macroalgal species. We assess the level and patterns of population-genetic

 structuring in two codistributed invertebrate species that differ substantially in terms of their disposition to rafting. Sypharochiton pelliserpentis and S. sinclairi are closely related, intertidal chiton species (Fig. 1) that are both widespread and abundant in coastal New Zealand. Their natural populations have the same mean and distribution of body lengths, and they spawn in a synchronized manner during autumn high tides when sea and air temperatures drop rapidly (Johns 1960). Sypharochiton sinclairi is typically found inside or under holdfasts of southern bull-kelp Durvillaea antarctica (Cham.) in the low intertidal, whereas S. pelliserpentis usually lives slightly higher in the intertidal, in shallow rock pools and on rocky surfaces. This study was instigated by our frequent observations of live Sypharochiton adults inside holdfast cavities of beach-cast D. antarctica on sandy beaches of southeastern New Zealand, indicative of the chitons’ ability to survive transportation on detached and drifting D. antarctica.
The two species have a somewhat confused taxonomic history. Although unquestioned as separate species by early taxonomists such as Suter (1913) and Iredale & Hull (1932), an ecological study by Johns (1960) concluded that only a single polymorphic species was involved, and his view was widely adopted for example by Boyle (1969) who studied ecology and
physiological tolerance of Sypharochiton. Morton & Miller’s (1973) survey of the ecology of New Zealand intertidal communities nevertheless differentiated between these ‘forms’, and Powell (1979), in maintaining their separate species status, noted that only S. pelliserpentis was found at the Chatham Islands. Bullock (1988), however, formally synonymized the two names, and Kaas et al.’s (2006) authoritative chiton monograph followed this treatment. By contrast, our mtDNA sequence data (details provided in Data S1, supporting information) strongly support the reciprocal monophyly of S. pelliserpentis and S. sinclairi, and hence their separate status under a phylogenetic species concept, consistent with their clear ecological differentiation.
As does their close relative, Chiton tuberculatus, both S. pelliserpentis and S. sinclairi probably have limited capacity for larval dispersal via a short-lived lecithotrophic phase that extends for a few days at most (Lewis 1960). While their precise larval duration is not known, if maternal body size correlates with egg size and in turn with larval duration (see Marshall & Bolton 2007), there should be little difference between the species. Additionally, given their synchronized spawning in adjacent microhabitats, we expect S. pelliserpentis and S. sinclairi to have very similar capacity for gene flow via larval dispersal. If this is the case, then any major population-genetic differences between these two taxa may well hinge on the rafting ability of S. sinclairi. Owing to its higher rafting potential, we expect S. sinclairi to exhibit more frequent migration and hence relatively low levels of genetic differentiation between populations (Hypothesis 1). In addition, given that frequent long-distance dispersal by rafting may result in recruitment events where the source population may be geographically very remote from the recruited population, we expect S. sinclairi to show a weaker correlation between geographical distance and population-genetic differentiation than S. pelliserpentis (Hypothesis 2).
Materials and methods
Study area and sample collection
The oceanography of New Zealand’s southeastern coast is dominated by the northeast-flowing Southland Current (Fig. 2). We sampled Sypharochiton specimens from six rocky shore localities between May 2008 and February 2011 (Fig. 2, Table S1, supporting information). A 180km-long habitat gap (alluvial mixed sand and gravel beach; Eikaas & Hemmingsen 2006) separates the Banks Peninsula sampling sites from those further south; the Stewart Island site is separated from the closest South Island site by a 58-km stretch of Foveaux Strait. Kelpassociated Sypharochiton were obtained from Durvillaea

The Southland Front bounds the northward-flowing Southland Current (arrows). Major discontinuities in the chiton habitat in the study area are introduced by the shingle beach along the Canterbury Bight and the deep water of Foveaux Strait. Sample sizes of each species from each of the two habitat types (holdfasts of the southern bull-kelp, Durvillaea antarctica; intertidal rock) are illustrated in the insert. At site #6, the species were collected from two different but similarly south-facing inlets (6a, 6b). See Table S1 (Supporting information) for detailed information on the sampling sites.
antarctica holdfasts after detaching them from rock platforms using an axe and ⁄ or a wrench bar, whereas rocky shore Sypharochiton were collected from the rocky intertidal immediately above the Durvillaea kelp beds. Samples of kelpvs. rock-associated Sypharochiton were collected from within a few metres of one another at all sites except Banks Peninsula, where rock vs. holdfast samples were obtained from adjacent inlets approximately equidistant from the other five sites. We measured the distance between each sample site pair as the shortest marine distance measured in Google Earth. Specimens were immersed in 96% ethanol upon collection, with samples from each habitat stored and labelled separately. We replaced the ethanol after 1–2 days and stored the samples at 4 °C in the laboratory prior to analyses.
Preparation of AFLP fingerprints
We extracted the total genomic DNA of 336 Sypharochiton individuals in six batches using the protocol described by Zavodna et al. (2008). To avoid contamination of the fingerprints by other than chiton DNA, DNA was extracted from a ~2 mg piece of deep girdle tissue that had not been in direct contact with the environment. Duplicate
DNA extractions were prepared at random from 1⁄8 of the chitons per each DNA-extraction batch. The tissue samples were digested for 16 h in the extraction buffer with 0.06 mg of proteinase K before precipitation of proteins and DNA with ammonium acetate and ethanol, respectively. After a wash with 70% ethanol, DNA pellets were air-dried and dissolved in MilliQ water. A negative control sample was prepared with every DNAextraction batch. The DNA concentration of each sample was measured with a ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and diluted to 9–14 ng ⁄ lL, as required, with MilliQ water. We confirmed the high molecular weight of extracted DNA by running 5-lL aliquots on 1% agarose gel in the presence of SybrSafe (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
We performed AFLP fingerprinting in four batches using 96-well PCR plates. Each of the four batches contained individuals from all 12 sampling units (two habitats · six locations), typically around seven individuals per habitat and per location. The replicate pairs were always processed in the same fingerprinting batch. We subjected the negative DNA-extraction controls to all the same AFLP fingerprinting procedures as the tissue samples to control for any cross-contamination or PCR noise caused by primer⁄DNA interactions. Our AFLP fingerprinting generally followed the protocol of Vos et al. (1995), but with restriction enzyme digestion and adapter ligation reactions carried out simultaneously in the same tube. In a total volume of 11 lL, the digestion–ligation reaction mix contained 42–66 ng of total genomic DNA, 1· T4 Buffer (Bioline, London, United Kingdom), 1 U MseI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 2.4 U EcoRI (New England Biolabs), 1 U T4 DNA Ligase (Bioline), 10 pMol annealed MseI linkers, 1 pMol annealed EcoRI linkers, 1 mM ATP (Bioline), 50 mM NaCl2, and 55 ng BSA (New England Biolabs). The reaction was capped with paraffin oil, incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, and then diluted to 1:10 with MilliQ water. The dilution was used as template in the preselective PCR made up to a volume of 12.5 lL, which contained 1· MangoTaq PCR Buffer (Bioline), 3 mM MgCl2, 10 ng BSA, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 5 pMol EcoRI + A primer, 5 pMol MseI-CA primer, and 0.25 U MangoTaq DNA Polymerase (Bioline). Preamplification PCR cycling conditions were 72°C for 2min; 29 cycles of 94°C for 30s, 56°C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final step of 60 °C for 30 min and cooling to 20 °C. Aliquots of 5 lL of each preselective PCR product were run on a 1% agarose gel to check the amplification success and its uniformity across the sample plate. The remaining PCR product was diluted 1:20 with MilliQ water and used as template in PCR performed using three different selective primer combinations: E-ACC (PET-labelled) ⁄ M-CAA, E-AAG ⁄ (VIC-labelled) M-CAT, and E-AAC ⁄

(NED-labelled) M-CAC. We picked the selective M-primer to combine with each selective E-primer among the four possible M-primers (M-CA+A ⁄ T ⁄ G ⁄ C), based on the fingerprint quality and fragment numbers they produced when applied to a set six kelp-dwelling and six rock-dwelling Sypharochiton individuals. The selective PCR cycling conditions were 94 °C for 2 min; 13 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, a step-down annealing temperature for 1min,70°Cfor1min;23cyclesof94°Cfor30s,56°C for 1 min, 70 °C for 1 min, followed by a final step of 70 °C for 4 min. The starting temperature for the stepdown modification of the annealing phase was 65 °C, and a 0.7 °C decrease in the temperature was introduced in each cycle. All incubations and PCRs were performed in Eppendorf Mastercycler Ep gradient S incubators. We pooled the three selective PCR products and electrophoresed a 2-lL aliquot of this mixture using a 96-capillary 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at the Genetic Analysis Services at Otago University, prepared with GeneScanTM LIZ600 Size Standard and Hi-DiTM Formamide. After running the sample plates, we assessed the instrument noise level of the 3730xl DNA Analyzer by running 12 samples that contained size standard and formamide only.
We scored the AFLP profiles in a semi-automated fashion, following the procedure introduced by Whitlock et al. (2008). A non-normalized calling of all fragments between 50–600 bp long and of signal intensity higher than 50 relative fluorescent units (rfu) was first performed using GeneMarker (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA), applying smoothing, peak saturation, baseline subtraction, pull-up correction, stutter-peak filtering, plus-A filtering, a very lenient peak score threshold of 0.1 and bin width of 1 bp. These initial data contained a total of 514 candidate AFLP loci. We calculated the average number of peaks called per primer combination per individual and subsequently excluded any profiles where a fingerprint yielded multiple peaks more than two standard deviations below the average for that primer combination. The replication rate for this quality-controlled data set was 10.7%. We normalized the peak heights, selected the final set of loci to be used for the population-genetic analyses, and defined optimal allele-calling thresholds for those loci using AFLP Score (Whitlock et al. 2008). We explored the effects of a range of allele-calling thresholds (on normalized peak heights) on the mismatch error rate of the replicated sample set and found out that a satisfactory overall error rate of 5.5% was achieved by setting the absolute allele-calling threshold at 170 rfu for the VICand NED-labelled fingerprints and at 160 rfu for the PETlabelled fingerprints. Applying the above criteria, we retrieved fingerprints at 297 polymorphic AFLP loci for 288 Sypharochiton individuals.
Species assignment prior to population-genetic analyses
Morphological shell characteristics that have been proposed to discriminate S. pelliserpentis and S. sinclairi are often difficult to inspect owing to the highly eroded condition of rocky shore specimens. Therefore, we used AFLP data to objectively assess the species identity of samples. Specifically, we performed genetic clustering with STRUCTURE ver. 2.2 (Pritchard et al. 2000) to reveal partitioning of AFLP multilocus genotypes (Falush et al. 2007), using the non-admixture model with correlated allele frequencies and no a priori information about species identity or collection habitat. We estimated the most likely number of non-interbreeding genetic clusters (K) in the data by comparing posterior probabilities of K-values from 1 to 3. We ensured the convergence of the algorithm by completing, for each K, three independent 200 000 iteration long runs with a burn-in of 50000 iterations that yielded identical results. The data received by far the highest posterior probability when K = 2, and the assignment probabilities of the individual chitons to one these two clusters were clear-cut: 100% for 286 individuals and above 98% for the remaining three individuals. We further examined the AFLP-fingerprint differentiation between the STRUCTURE-defined clusters by conducting a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of covariance-standardized pairwise distances between the fingerprints using GenAlEx v. 6.4.1 (Peakall & Smouse 2006) and by constructing PCoA plots of the first two coordinates with the fingerprints labelled according to their species identity ⁄ habitat of origin (Fig. 3). The genetic clusters showed a strong association with either kelp holdfast or rock habitat, and so following the ecological literature, the distinct conchological features of non-eroded individuals and the corresponding mtDNA differentiation (Fig. 1), we regarded the kelp-associated cluster as S. sinclairi and the rock-dwelling cluster as S. pelliserpentis. The extent to which the species were locally encountered in each habitat type is shown in Fig. 2, and the sample sizes of each species across the six major locations are listed in Table S1 (Supporting information). Of the initial 297 AFLP loci used for species assignment, 235 were polymorphic in S. sinclairi and 186 in S. pelliserpentis. All of these markers were subsequently used for population-genetic analyses. The data were deposited in the Dryad data repository.

& Van de Peer 2002) with 100 000 random permutations of the data. We used zt also to test for correlations of the linFPT matrices with the presence⁄absence of major habitat gaps (Canterbury Bight, Foveaux Strait) between the sites and for correlation between the linFPT matrices of the two species. The program MANTELTESTER (http://manteltester.berlios.de) was used to run zt. One negative FPT -value in S. pelliserpentis was set to 0 before linearization and the Mantel tests.
Results
The genetic cluster assignment analysis with STRUCTURE revealed that the intertidal chitons Sypharochiton sinclairi and S. pelliserpentis are broadly segregated in their habitat use. Summed over all sample sites, 81% of S. sinclairi specimens were collected from bull-kelp holdfasts, whereas 91% of the S. pelliserpentis were collected from bare rock surfaces. Although habitat ⁄ species segregation was very consistent across most sampling localities, there were some exceptions: at site #1, 36% of the S. pelliserpentis were from kelp habitat, whereas at site #2, 52% of the S. sinclairi samples were from rock habitat (see Fig. 2 insert). It should also be noted that we did not sample randomly across habitats.
Global AMOVA results showed that both Sypharochiton species exhibit subtle but statistically significant levels of genetic structuring: the rock-associated S. pelliserpentis had a higher proportion of its genetic variability partitioned among sites (3.84%, P < 0.0001) than the holdfastassociated S. sinclairi (2.05%, P = 0.001). When looking at population sample pairs, in nine of the total 15 pairs, S. pelliserpentis yielded higher FPT values than S. sinclairi (Table 1). The global FPT estimated for S. pelliserpentis was 0.038, whereas the estimate for S. sinclairi was 0.021. Taken at face value, the 0.017 difference in the global FPT estimates would correspond to nearly twice as many migrants per generation between S. sinclairi populations than for S. pelliserpentis. Local genetic diversity, as measured by expected heterozygosity (HE) levels per site, was significantly higher in S. pelliserpentis than in S. sinclairi, but the proportions of polymorphic and private loci (bands) in local populations were not found to be significantly different between the species (Table 2).
Migrant number estimates between sites (Fig. 4) suggest that S. sinclairi has experienced higher connectivity than S. pelliserpentis across the habitat discontinuity at the Canterbury Bight. All five sample pairs of S. pelliserpentis across this 180-km habitat gap showed evidence for restricted gene flow, compared to three population pairs for S. sinclairi (Table 1). Interestingly, two S. sinclairi sample comparisons across this habitat gap showed the lowest FPT estimates in the whole data set (Table 1, Fig. 4).

and tested the statistical significance of the proportions against 9999 random permutations of the data, using the software GenAlEx v. 6.4.1 (Peakall & Smouse 2006). Using the same software, we also quantified the level of genetic connectivity between each intraspecific population sample pair by estimating the fixation index FPT, an analogue of FST for dominant data. We evaluated the statistical significance of the FPT estimates against 9999 random permutations of the data sets and corrected the resulting P-value for multiple testing using Benjamini & Hochberg’s (1995) method for controlling false discovery rate. To measure genetic connectivity between sites in terms of migration, we converted the FPT estimates into estimates of effective number of migrants per generation (Nm) between the sample sites using equation Nm = (1-FPT) ⁄ 4 * FPT (cf. Wright 1951). GenAlEx was also employed to calculate basic sample-wise diversity statistics from the AFLP data: expected heterozygosity, proportion of polymorphic bands occurring at frequency above 5% and the proportion of private bands per population relative to the total number of bands detected in a species. We assessed the correlation of oceanographic distance and population-pairwise genetic distance as measured by linearized FPT (derived as Slatkin’s (1995) linearized FST) by conducting Mantel tests of the distance matrixes using the software zt (Bonnet

Fig. 5 Relationships between linearized population-pairwise FPT and oceanographic distance in Sypharochiton sinclairi and S. pelliserpentis. Coefficients of determination, P-values from one-tailed Mantel tests (H0: R2 = 0; H1: R2 > 0) and the best-fit linear regressions are shown in the graphs.
Mantel test with that distance set to the maximum FPT among the rest of the site pairs (0.063). The correlation remained statistically significant at an a-level of 0.038 but was weaker (R2 = 0.177). Both species showed a weak positive correlation between linFPT estimates and the presence of major habitat gaps between sample sites, but these correlations were not statistically significant. Also, the spatial population-genetic structuring of one species was not significantly correlated with that of the other (Table 1, Fig. 6).
Discussion
Broadly, our study suggests that adult habitat preference can have substantial implications for genetic connectivity. Specifically, we detected substantial differences in population-genetic structuring of rockassociated (S. pelliserpentis) vs. kelp-associated (S. sinclairi) chitons. While both species showed only modest levels of population structuring, the overall level of population-genetic differentiation in S. pelliserpentis was
nearly twice as high as in S. sinclairi, supporting our Hypothesis 1. We estimate that S. sinclairi populations, overall, experience at least 6% more migration than

equivalent populations of S. pelliserpentis. Moreover, the correlation between genetic and oceanographic distances was stronger in S. pelliserpentis than in S. sinclairi, in accordance with our Hypothesis 2.
This genetic analysis uses comparative data to provide some of the first quantitative evidence in support of rafting as an influential vector for gene flow in the marine environment. Specifically, by assessing the genetic outcomes of what is essentially a ‘natural experiment’, we can infer that rafting facilitates population connectivity, in addition to its previously inferred role in promoting colonization (Waters & Roy 2004; Donald et al. 2005; Fraser et al. 2009, 2011; Nikula et al. 2010). Our analysis also suggests that marine ecologists should broaden their traditional focus on larval dispersal to include more consideration of adult dispersal even in relatively sessile species.
Based on what we know of the species’ reproductive biology, we would expect similar patterns of larval dispersal for both S. pelliserpentis and S. sinclairi. However, we detected no spatial correlation between the patterns of population-genetic differentiation between these phylogenetically close and codistributed chiton species. We conclude, therefore, that their contrasting patterns of genetic connectivity are likely governed by their distinct rafting potential. Gene flow in S. pelliserpentis is presumably shaped by predictable patterns of larval dispersal, whereas gene flow between populations of S. sinclairi is likely augmented by relatively unpredictable rafting events of adults. Kelp-rafting events can potentially last for hours, days or even months (Fraser et al. 2011), implying that the geographical spread of their gene-flow effects can be highly variable. Even under stable, unidirectional oceanographic conditions, the geographical distances covered by drifting Durvillaea antarctica vary enormously between events, ranging from local dispersal at the scale of tens of kilometres to oceanic dispersal reaching at least 500 km (Collins et al. 2010). Nevertheless, a recent genetic study of beach-cast D. antarctica demonstrated regular northward oceanographic transport of detached bull-kelp across the ecological barrier of the Canterbury Bight’s alluvial shore (Collins et al. 2010). Our observation of high connectivity of S. sinclairi across the Bight implies that this kelp-associated species may be a regular passenger on such rafting journeys. However, we acknowledge that comparative data on the settlement times of the species’ larvae are desirable for a completely robust evaluation of the gene-flow effects of rafting dispersal of Sypharochiton adults.
Population-genetic theory predicts that, migration rates being equal, a species with large effective population sizes is better able to maintain gene variants in its populations, and to resist population differentiation due
to genetic drift, than a species with a small effective population sizes (e.g. Frankham 1996). Furthermore, fluctuations of the census population size have the potential to significantly influence the effective size of natural populations (Frankham 1995). It is unlikely that the higher differentiation of S. pelliserpentis populations could be due to its populations fluctuating more than those of S. sinclairi, as the main habitat of S. pelliserpentis (bare intertidal rock) is more stable in quantity and quality at microevolutionary timescales than the main habitat of S. sinclairi (bull-kelp beds). If anything, we would expect effective population sizes of S. sinclairi to be smaller than those of S. pelliserpentis, and to translate into more pronounced population-genetic differentiation of the species in our results. In contrast, we found that the kelp-associated S. sinclairi generally has lower population-genetic differentiation than S. pelliserpentis, which suggests that dispersal by rafting may have the potential to ameliorate effects of genetic drift in populations of kelp-associated species.
It is important to consider the findings of the present analysis in the context of comparable studies from other ecologically distinct intertidal taxa, especially from the New Zealand region. A recent microsatellite DNA analysis of epifaunal vs. rock-dwelling topshell gastropods (Diloma) revealed a similar population-genetic contrast associated with habitat preference (Nikula et al. 2011). As with the present study of chitons, the kelp-associated topshell species showed enhanced connectivity across the Canterbury Bight habitat gap. In the present study, we detected what seems even a stronger effect of rafting-mediated gene flow. Based on the directly documented long-distance rafting endurance of several chiton species (Fraser et al. 2011), and from field observations of holdfast fauna, we suggest that chitons’ better ability than the snails’ to remain attached to drifting kelp best explains the enhanced genetic connectivity observed here. Taken together, our observations on the genetic structuring of kelpvs. rock-associated mollusc species in two different classes lend support for the hypothesis that kelp rafting can enhance gene flow over long distances.
