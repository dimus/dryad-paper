Abstract
Bush Blitz is a three-year multimillion dollar program to document the plants and animals in hundreds of properties across Australia’s National Reserve System. The core focus is on nature discovery – identifying and describing new species of plants and animals. The Bush Blitz program has enabled the collection and description of beeflies (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from surveys in Western Australia and Queensland. Three new species of Australian beeflies belonging to the Exoprosopini are described; Palirika mackenziei Lambkin, sp. n., Palirika culgoafloodplainensis Lambkin, sp. n., and Larrpana bushblitz Lambkin, sp. n. Phylogenetic analysis of 40 Australian exoprosopine species belonging to the Balaana generic-group Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 supports the placement of the three new species into existing genera, and the erection and description of the new genus Ngalki Lambkin, gen. n. for Ngalki trigonium (Lambkin & Yeates, 2003), comb. n. Revised keys are provided for the genera of the Australian Balaana genus-group and the species of Palirika Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 and Larrpana Lambkin & Yeates, 2003. With the description of the three new species and the transferral of Munjua trigona Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 into the new genus Ngalki Lambkin, gen. n., three genera are rediagnosed; Munjua Lambkin & Yeates, 2003, Palirika and Larrpana.

232 Christine L. Lambkin & Justin S. Bartlett / ZooKeys 150: 231–280 (2011) introduction
While there are more than 140,000 published species in Australia, more than 40 per cent of continental Australia has never been comprehensively surveyed by scientists. This research was supported through funding from the Bush Blitz species discovery program, a partnership between the Australian Government, BHP Billiton and Earthwatch Australia. This innovative partnership harnesses the expertise of many of Australia’s top scientists from museums, herbaria, universities, and other institutions and organisations across the country. Bush Blitz is expected to uncover hundreds of new species and provide baseline scientific data that will help us protect our biodiversity for generations to come.
This paper describes three species of beeflies from the Exoprosopini (Diptera, Bombyliidae, Anthracinae); two captured during Bush Blitz surveys and a third species collected from south-western Queensland (Qld). All three species belong to genera recently described (Palirika Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 and Larrpana Lambkin & Yeates, 2003) in a large revisionary monograph (Lambkin et al. 2003) and therefore can be described reasonably easily as all collected material has been examined recently, and the context for their description is in place.
The beeflies belong to the Family Bombyliidae, a very large, cosmopolitan family of stoutly built flies, mostly with very characteristic venation. Almost 5000 species have been described worldwide (Evenhuis and Greathead 1999) and around 370 have been described from Australia, with many more species awaiting description (Yeates and Lambkin 2006). Nine of the 15 recognised subfamilies (Yeates 1994) are found in Australia, and a key to these subfamilies is available (Lambkin et al. 2003). Most Australian species belong to the subfamilies Bombyliinae, Anthracinae and Lomatiinae. The Anthracinae are well represented in Australia, mainly by the cosmopolitan Anthrax Scopoli, 1763, Ligyra Newman, 1841, Villa Lioy, 1864, and a number of endemic genera including Palirika and Larrpana (Yeates and Lambkin 1998; Lambkin et al. 2003). Of the seven anthracine tribes, three (Villoestrini, Prorostomatini, Aphoebantini) are not found in Australia. Keys to the four tribes of the Anthracini occurring in Australia are available (Lambkin et al. 2003). The tribe Xeramoebini is represented in Australia by only two, still undescribed, species of Petrorossia Bezzi, 1908. There are 28 species of Australian Villini in the genera Villa, Exechohypopion Evenhuis, 1991 and Lepidanthrax Osten Sacken, 1877 (Evenhuis and Greathead, 1999). The Anthracini is represented by 34 described species in the genera Anthrax, Brachyanax Evenhuis, 1981, and Thraxan Yeates & Lambkin, 1998 (Yeates and Lambkin 1998). Based on the phylogenetic analyses the Australian Exoprosopini was expanded to ten genera containing 65 species, including seven new genera for 42 species in the Balaana genus-group Yeates & Lambkin (Lambkin et al. 2003).
Australian exoprosopines are large beeflies of diverse and striking appearance (Figs 4C, 6D, 7B) with wings usually bearing distinct hyaline and black patterns. Like most bombyliids, adult Australian exoprosopines are well covered in long, dense, coloured hairs arranged in patterns, often in stripes across the dorsal surface of the abdomen, leading to their common name of beeflies. In Australian exoprosopines, like other

Bush Blitz aids description of three new species 233
members of the Anthracinae, many of the long hairs, especially on the dorsal surface, are modified into short, broad, flattened scales, often in contrasting stripes. The scales may be erect or upstanding, producing a “fluffy” appearance as in Larrpana bushblitz Lambkin, sp. n. (Fig. 7A). Sometimes the dorsal scales are tightly adpressed, producing a smooth, often shiny appearance as in Palirika (Fig. 6D). Some beeflies have some scales or hairs that are reflective, appearing shining gold or brilliantly silver as on the terminal tergites of the male anthracine Anthrax maculatus Macquart, 1846 (Yeates and Lambkin 1998). While many beeflies have vestiture (hairs or scales) that is shiny, only the endemic Australian genus Palirika has metallic, reflective scales for which the colour of the reflected light is different from the colour of the scales. In this genus black scales on the dorsal surface of the face, thorax, and abdomen may be iridescent and refractive, and reflect green, blue, maroon or purple colours (Fig. 6C, D). The reflectivity may be very dull, almost dark as in Palirika mackenziei Lambkin, sp. n. (Fig. 6C, D), or highly reflective and bright (Lambkin et al. 2003).
Adult Australian exoprosopines favour warm, sunny localities, especially in the more arid regions. Most have a strong, hovering flight, and are commonly taken from blossom, or sitting on patches of bare earth. Adults are pollen and nectar feeders, and many are important pollinators of native plants. Many species can be collected congregating on hilltops, demonstrating a landmark-based mating system (Lambkin et al. 2003). Very little is known about the life histories of Australian exoprosopines, but some larvae are hyperparasites, parasitising prepupal instars of Hymenoptera that, in turn, are parasitising Coleoptera (Yeates et al. 1999).
This paper describes three new species of exoprosopine beeflies; two captured during Bush Blitz surveys and a third species collected from south-western Qld.
Palirika mackenziei sp. n. was collected from the large grazing property, Plevna Downs, owned by the Mackenzie family, 63 km west of Eromanga, in extremely arid south-western in late December 2007. While accompanied by Noel Starick (QM volunteer) and Robyn Mackenzie, CLL hand netted a single female specimen (Fig. 6C, D) hill-topping on the summit of Tompilly Hill (Fig. 1A, B), a jump up on Plevna Downs. This species was unlike any other Palirika collected; smaller and darker in both body and wing infuscation.
Four male specimens (Fig. 7A, B) of Larrpana bushblitz sp. n. were hand netted by CLL from Karara Pastoral Lease in Western Australia, hill-topping on Forrest lookout (Fig. 1D), 24.4km SE Boiada Camp and on a nearby hilltop 23.5km ESE Boiada Camp during the Bush Blitz survey co-organised by WAM on Charles Darwin Reserve, Karara, Lochada and Kadji Kadji Pastoral Leases, 213 km ESE of Geraldton, in September 2009. This species appeared similar to the two male specimens of Larrpana zwicki Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 collected only near Windorah (Lambkin et al. 2003).
Palirika culgoafloodplainensis Lambkin sp. n. was collected from Culgoa Floodplains National Park (NP) on the Queensland/New South Wales Border, 134 km WSW Dirranbandi, during the Bush Blitz survey of Culgoa Floodplains NP Qld, Culgoa NP and Ledknapper Nature Reserve (NR) NSW (NSW) organised by CLL and Noel Starick from QM between November 2009 and June 2010. A single male specimen

234 Christine L. Lambkin & Justin S. Bartlett / ZooKeys 150: 231–280 (2011)
(Fig. 4C, D) was sorted by QM volunteer John Purdie from a Malaise trap sample from 7 km NNW Toulby Gate (Fig. 1C) on Culgoa Floodplains National Park (NP). Malaise and Pitfall traps had been set at four sites on Culgoa Floodplains by CLL, Noel Starick and NP Ranger Cheryn Kelly in November 2009 as part of the Bush Blitz survey. The rangers had agreed to take monthly samples until we could return. This specimen was from a Malaise trap that had been reset on the 20th January 2010 by Ranger-In-Charge (RIC) Andy (Keith) Coward. Because of significant rain, the rangers were unable to return to take another sample until the 19th March. Subsequent flooding in March and April 2010 prevented access to the survey areas until midMay when CLL, Noel, Rhys Smith (QM volunteer) and rangers Andy and Megan Simpson retrieved the Culgoa Floodplains NP traps. This species was similar to Palirika bouchardi Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 that has been extensively collected from arid areas of central and western Australia from all states except South Australia.
Previous phylogenetic analysis of the worldwide Exoprosopini showed that the Australian bombyliids that were previously placed in Exoprosopa Macquart 1840, belonged to the monophyletic Balaana group of genera, sister to the Australian Ligyra (Lambkin et al. 2003). Phylogenetic analysis of 207 morphological characters of the Balaana group of genera led to the description of seven new genera for 42 species in that genus-group in Lambkin et al. (2003). Phylogenetic analysis of the same 207 morphological characters scored for two Ligyra outgroup taxa and 40 Australian species belonging to the Balaana generic-group supports the placement of the three new species into existing genera, and the erection of the new genus Ngalki Lambkin gen. n. for Ngalki trigonium (Lambkin & Yeates, 2003), comb. n. (Figs 2, 3).
Revised keys are provided for the genera of the Australian Balaana genus-group and the species of Palirika and Larrpana. The three new species are fully described; with diagnoses, distribution maps, and images of both external characters and dissected genitalia. The new genus Ngalki is described with diagnosis, and images of both external characters and dissected genitalia. With the description of three new species and the transferral of Munjua trigona Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 into the new genus Ngalki, three genera are rediagnosed; Munjua Lambkin & Yeates, Palirika and Larrpana.
We attempted to use cybertaxonomic tools to produce this paper as had been used to streamline taxonomic publication of new fly species by Winterton (2009), Brake and von Tschirnhaus (2010), Blagoderov et al. (2010b), and Winterton and Gaimari (2011). Attempts to use the morphological phylogenetic matrix to produce natural language descriptions provided only clumsy, inadequate descriptions. Using Blagoderov et al. (2010a) as a guide we completed automatic generation of the manuscript within a Virtual Research Environment (Scratchpads). As the publication module in Scratchpads is still under development, semantic enhancements, and parallel release of the publication on paper and on-line accompanied with registration of new taxa with ZooBank (http://www.zoobank.org/) as per the recent proposed amendment to the International Code of Zoological nomenclature for a universal register for animal names (Polaszek et al. 2005a, 2005b; ICZN 2008) were completed through submission of a Microsoft Office Word 2003 document to ZooKeys.

extraction. Those samples were given a tissue number (e.g. A007534) that was entered into the QM Vernon database and attached under each specimen on a yellow label.
For explanation of morphological abbreviations, see Appendix 1.
The genitalia of each species were prepared by dissecting the terminal abdominal segments and then placing in cool 10% KOH overnight. Following maceration the specimen was washed, and then dissected in distilled water. Dissected genitalia were placed in alcohol for microscopic examination and into K–Y® Jelly for photography. All dissected parts from a specimen were placed in a genitalia vial containing glycerine which was pinned beneath the identification label.
Images were taken of the whole fly, external features, and dissected genitalia. A series of multiple-focal-depth digital images were taken using a Canon EOS 500D digital camera fitted, via a Leica 10446175 1x SLR Projection Lens, to a Leica MZ6 stereo dissecting microscope, and combined into a high resolution serial montage image using Helicon Focus v.5.2 Pro (Kozub 2011) or Zerene Stacker v.1.02 (Littlefield 2011). Higher-resolution digital images were deposited in Morphbank (www.morphbank. net). Separate collections of images were created for each species in Morphbank where each collection receives a unique identifier and associated URL. The URL links to the Morphbank collections have been embedded within the descriptions for each species. Images were assembled into plates using Adobe Photoshop C S5 version 13.0.3 (Adobe Systems, 2010b) and Adobe Illustrator C S5 version 15.0.2 (Adobe Systems, 2010a). Those samples were given a photograph number (e.g. PS1714) that was entered into the QM Vernon database and attached under each specimen on a purple label.
Distribution maps were produced using ArcView GIS version 3.1 (ESRI, 1998).
We intended to use cybertaxonomic methods to document these newly discovered Australian beeflies, enabling descriptions of the three new species to be generated using web resources to populate electronic documents through links to Morphbank, Life Science Identifiers, and Zoobank as had been done by Winterton (2009) whose revision serves as an example for making taxonomic description and key development more efficient by avoiding redundancy in data handling and using digital media. We hoped to complete taxonomic descriptions using a character matrix in Structured Descriptive Data format developed in Lucid Builder to simultaneously generate natural language descriptions and a key. However we encountered problems transferring the compiled phylogenetic data matrix to Lucid. Instead MacClade 4 (Maddison and Maddison 2003) was used to generate natural language descriptions based on a phylogenetic matrix including 413 phylogenetic (morphological) and phenetic (colour) characters. The resultant descriptions were clumsy and inadequate. Instead, we developed descriptions in Microsoft Office Word 2003 based on the electronic versions of closely related described species from Lambkin et al. (2003).
Several initiatives around the world have been developing tools to bring revisionary taxonomy to the web. Recent examples include software produced through the CATE (Creating a taxonomic e-science, http://www.cate-project.org), EDIT (European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy, http://www.e-taxonomy.eu) and the Australian TRIN (Taxonomy Research & Information Network, http://www.taxonomy.org.au/) projects.

Bush Blitz aids description of three new species 239
These efforts support the compilation of large distributed datasets, descriptions and identification of biota. One of the tools developed in association with the EDIT initiative are the Scratchpads (http://scratchpads.eu), a Web 2.0 Virtual Research Environment, that enable taxonomists to collaborate in the production of websites documenting the diversity of life. Using Blagoderov et al. (2010a) as a guide we set up the Australasian Asiloidea Online Scratchpad (http://australasianasiloidea.myspecies.info/). We initially included for public view the published diagnoses of genera and species of the Exoprosopini (Bombyliidae: Anthracinae) and the Taenogera genus-group (Therevidae: Agapophytinae). Pages including images, diagnoses, and descriptions were established for each of the undescribed species in the Australasian Asiloidea Online Scratchpad, but hidden from public view until publication.
The paper has been semantically tagged and enhanced using the Pensoft Mark Up Tool (PMT) which is based on the US National Library of Medicine’s DTD (Document Type Definitions) TaxPub extension http://sourceforge.net/projects/taxpub). We intend parallel release of the publication on paper and on-line accompanied by a) links to archived images on Morphbank, and b) with registration of authors, publications, taxon names and other nomenclatural acts in Zoobank, with assignment of Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for each new taxa as per the recent proposed amendment to the International Code of Zoological nomenclature for a universal register for animal names (Polaszek et al. 2005a; Polaszek et al. 2005b; ICZN 2008). The final XML output of the paper will be archived in PubMedCentral, a PDF uploaded in the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL), and all revised species registered in ZooBank (Penev et al. 2010).
Data resources
The nomenclatural and distributional information will be included in the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD), an open-access online catalogue of taxonomic and biological information on all animal species known to occur within Australia (ABRS, 2009), and the Australian Natural Heritage Assessment Tool (ANHAT), an open-access online map-supported database developed by the Australia Heritage Division of the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities that helps identify and prioritise areas for their natural heritage significance, focusing on biodiversity (NHAS 2009). The occurrence data has been uploaded as a Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A), to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) via the Pensoft Data Hosting Center at the GBIF's Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) (http://ipt.pensoft. net/ipt/). The data underpinning the analysis reported in this paper including the data matrix and a most parsimonious tree, together with matrices and trees from Lambkin et al. (2003), were deposited in the Dryad Data Repository (http://datadryad.org/) at doi: 10.5061/dryad.5j64k, the TREEBASE Repository (www.treebase.org/) at http:// purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S12050, and at GBIF, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, http://ipt.pensoft.net/ipt/resource.do?r=bushblitz

240 Christine L. Lambkin & Justin S. Bartlett / ZooKeys 150: 231–280 (2011) Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was based on 207 morphological characters from Lambkin et al. (2003) (Appendix 1). The three new taxa were added to the data matrix from Lambkin et al. (2003) and scored for external morphology including wing venation, and internal morphology of male and female genitalia to produce a matrix for two Ligyra outgroup taxa and 40 Australian species belonging to the Balaana generic-group in Mesquite version 2.74 (Maddison and Maddison 2010) (Appendix 2 & Appendix 3 LambkinOzBombs2011.nex).
Multistate characters used for phylogenetic analyses have been treated as unordered (non-additive Mickevich and Mitter 1981; Mickevich and Weller 1990). All synapomorphies were weighted equally (Farris 1990). Character polarity was determined by comparison with the outgroups. Variation in morphology between specimens of a taxon was scored as polymorphism and interpreted in the cladistic analyses as “partial uncertainty” (Swofford and Begle 1993) where PAUP* chooses a state from the set of available states that allows minimization of the tree length. There are 66 constant characters in the analysis as the morphological data matrix was based on coding of a much broader taxon sample of 107 worldwide exoprosopine taxa for 207 morphological characters used in Lambkin et al. (2003).
Phylogenetic analyses completed 100 random step-wise addition searches, with tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping, MULPARS, and branches having maximum length zero collapsed to yield polytomies in effect using PAUP*4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002).
We used Bremer support (Bremer 1992; Källersjö et al. 1992; Bremer 1994) to measure the strength of evidence for nodes. Bremer support of a group is the difference in length between the tree under consideration and the shortest tree lacking that group. Bremer support values were calculated with TreeRot v.2 (Sorenson 1999) with 20 heuristic searches of the data.
Cladograms and character distribution were analysed in WinClada version 1.00.08 (Nixon 2002) and edited in Adobe Illustrator C S5 version 15.0.2 (Adobe Systems 2010a).
Results
Cladistic analysis of the 42 taxa of 141 non-constant characters produced five most parsimonious trees (MPTs) of length =931, CI = 0.243, CI excluding uninformative characters = 0.231, and RI = 0.468. The five trees differ only in the placement of Larrpana dimidiatipennis (Bowden, 1971); as sister to the remaining Larrpana, sister to Muwarna Lambkin & Yeates, 2003, or sister to the Balaana genus-group excluding Wurda Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 and Kapu (Lambkin & Yeates, 2003). Most parsimonious tree 5 was chosen with reference to the majority-rule consensus tree (Margush and McMorris 1981) as the MPT included those nodes that were found most often in the remaining MPTs. Most parsimonious tree 5 is shown in two parts

Previous phylogenetic analysis of 207 morphological characters for the worldwide Exoprosopini showed that the Australian bombyliids that were previously placed in Exoprosopa, belonged to the monophyletic Balaana group of genera, sister to the Australian Ligyra. Phylogenetic analysis of characters of the Balaana group of genera then led to the description of seven new genera for 42 species in that genus-group (Lambkin et al. 2003). Phylogenetic analysis of the same 207 morphological characters for two Ligyra outgroup taxa and 40 Australian species supports the placement of the three new species into existing genera in the Balaana generic-group. Palirika mackenziei sp. n. and Palirika culgoafloodplainensis sp. n. form a clade within the well supported genus, Palirika and Larrpana bushblitz sp. n. forms a clade with Larrpana zwicki within the genus Larrpana (Figs 2, 3).
In Lambkin et al. (2003), Munjua was erected for three unusual species for which there were few apparent similarities. In that phylogenetic analysis, another particularly aberrant fly, Munjua trigona (Fig. 9A, B), was sister to the clade of Munjua and the two well-supported terminal clades of Palirika and Balaana Lambkin & Yeates, 2003. This fly clearly did not belong to either Palirika or Balaana as it possessed none of their diagnostic characters, and was therefore placed in the already heterogeneous Munjua rather than creating a monotypic genus (Lambkin et al. 2003).
In this phylogenetic analysis, Munjua trigona falls between Palirika and Balaana as sister to Palirika (Figs 2, 3). As this species clearly does not belong to Palirika, a new genus Ngalki for Ngalki trigonium is created.
With the description of the three new species and the transferral of Munjua trigona into the new genus Ngalki, the three genera Munjua, Palirika, and Larrpana require rediagnoses.

Etymology. This species is named culgoafloodplainensis after the remote Queensland Culgoa Floodplain National Park where the type specimen was collected, and where CLL and Noel Starick received so much hospitality, enthusiasm, and encouragement over the years from all the staff, but especially RIC Andy Coward.
Distribution. (Fig. 11). This species has only been collected from the type locality in central south-western Queensland.
Remarks. Due to extended storage in propylene glycol as retrieval of sample was prevented by extensive and prolonged flooding the specimen bears few setae, hairs or scales, therefore colour patterns referred to in the description are based on those remaining, usually at junctions of sclerites.

Etymology. This species is named mackenziei to acknowledge the enthusiasm and interest in all kinds of natural history by the Mackenzie family of Plevna Downs Station where the type, and only, specimen was collected. Since 2007, following the discovery of dinosaurs on their property, together with a large undescribed spider, CLL and Noel Starick have been welcomed by the Mackenzie family. Robyn Mackenzie was thrilled to be helping catch hill-topping beeflies on the summit of Tompilly Hill when the only female specimen of this unusual Palirika was captured (Fig. 1A). We have happily instructed the family, the local Natural History Society, students, teachers,

Etymology. This species is named as a noun in apposition after the three-year, multimillion dollar Bush Blitz program that organised and funded the survey on Charles Darwin Reserve, Karara, Lochada and Kadji Kadji Pastoral Leases in Western Australia on which this species was collected. The core focus of the Bush Blitz program is to document the plants and animals in hundreds of properties across Australia’s National Reserve System, and on nature discovery – identifying and describing new species of plants and animals. The Bush Blitz program also funded the survey in western New South Wales and Queensland on which Palirika culgoafloodplainensis sp. n. was collected (ABRS BB 2009/23887) and funded the description of these three species (ABRS BB TTG209-06).
Distribution. (Fig. 11). Larrpana bushblitz sp. n. has only been collected from Karara Pastoral Lease, 213 km ESE of Geraldton in Western Australia.
Comments. On collection, this species appeared similar to the two male specimens of Larrpana zwicki collected only near Windorah (Lambkin et al. 2003) and phylogenetic analysis (Figs 2–3) indicates a close relationship between the two.

unpigmented papillae, apical endplate simple with thin processes; thick-walled round SR with no basal bulb (Fig. 9F–H).
Etymology. The name for the genus Ngalki is from the aboriginal term ngalki for “little finger” from the Ngiyampaa language spoken in much of central New South Wales (Donaldson, 1994), referring to the diagnostic character of the male genitalia for this genus, and is treated as neutral. This follows the tradition set in Lambkin et al. (2003), of using appropriate aboriginal terms for the names of new genera of Australian exoprosopines.

(2003), the name trigona given to this species was derived from the Greek trigonas “triangular” This was the name the late Sergei Paramonov gave to this species in his unpublished manuscript, and was used to honour his extensive work on Australian bombyliids. With the transfer to Ngalki, the specific emendation requires adjustment, and becomes trigonium to reflect the neutral gender of the new genus-group name.
Distribution. This species has been collected in the southern Australian Bassian region, from semi-arid and arid mallee areas.
Comments. The finger-like projection on the H (Figs 9E, 10F) in the males of Ngalki trigonium is apparent without dissection and, together with the unusual wing pattern, allows easy identification.
