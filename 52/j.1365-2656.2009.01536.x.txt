Summary
1. Despite the central importance for life-history theory, egg-size effects on offspring fitness are still considered ambiguous. Most previous studies were only observational and consequently might suffer from uncontrolled correlations between egg size and parental/territory quality. Even after cross-fostering is performed, direct genetic effects and parental adjustment of post-natal care might confound our estimates of egg-size effects per se.
2. I performed a full cross-fostering experiment in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) exchanging the whole clutches between pairs of nests. I statistically controlled for direct genetic effects and parental feeding frequencies. I followed young until recruitment to estimate the long-term effects of egg size and parental provisioning. In addition, I compared the effects obtained in the cross-fostering experiment with those obtained from a set of unmanipulated nests.
3. Egg size per se affected offspring morphology in both the short and long term, while having no effect on offspring survival and immunity. Egg-size effects were not confounded by parental post-natal care and direct genetic effects.
4. The number of care-givers was an influential predictor of nestling performance. Apart from the variation caused by this factor, feeding frequencies had no consistent effect on offspring performance.
5. Fitness benefits of large eggs may be difficult to establish due to variation of egg-size effects between years and habitats. Feeding frequency may affect offspring state but offspring state may also affect feeding frequency. Varying causality between feeding rate and offspring state may preclude the detection of a positive effect of the former on the latter.

 Introduction
In theory, parents might maximize their fitness either through many small offspring with low survival prospects or through fewer large offspring with higher viability (Smith & Fretwell 1974). This trade-off between the number and size of offspring is one of the central tenets of life-history theory (Roff 1992). The trade-off is most easily studied in oviparous taxa, as investment per offspring can be easily estimated and is probably under high maternal control. In birds, clutch size is, unsurprisingly, a strong predictor of the number of fledglings
in both observational (e.g. Gustafsson & Sutherland 1988) and experimental studies (e.g. Gustafsson and Sutherland 1988; reviews of clutch enlargement studies in Roff 1992; Van der Werf 1992). A positive effect of egg size on offspring fitness is, however, more equivocal (Williams 1994). Nestling size is usually strongly determined by egg size shortly after hatching but this effect often rapidly diminishes as young grow older with no effect at the time of fledging (e.g. Smith, Ohlsson & Wettermark 1995; Krist et al. 2004; reviewed in Williams 1994). Moreover, most of the studies reviewed by Williams (1994) were observational. Causality of observed egg-size effects is therefore questionable. Egg size may be correlated with parental or territorial quality which could independently affect both egg size and offspring post-natal

size or survival (Reid and Boersma 1990, Bolton 1991). Some authors even use egg size as a surrogate measure of overall female quality (Hörak, Mänd & Ots 1997).
At least three methods exist for controlling parental quality while testing for egg-size effects (Krist & RemeS 2004). First, the best solution in terms of control of confounding factors is experimental manipulation of egg size. Such studies were performed in insects (Fox 1997), reptiles (Sinervo et al. 1992; Olsson, Wapstra & Olofsson 2002), domesticated birds in laboratory conditions (Hill 1993; Finkler, Van Orman & Sotherland 1998) and only recently in nondomesticated birds either in the laboratory (Wagner & Williams 2007) or in the wild (Ferrari, Martinelli & Saino 2006; Alquati et al. 2007). A potential drawback of these studies is the low hatchability of manipulated eggs (Finkler et al. 1998; Alquati et al. 2007; Wagner & Williams 2007; but see Ferrari et al. 2006) which might be a side effect of an invasive experimental procedure rather than a direct consequence of a smaller egg.
Second, in within-brood comparisons (e.g. Howe 1976; Krist et al. 2004) parental and territory quality are the same for all broodmates and so cannot confound egg-size effect estimates (see Krist & RemeS). In theory, females might gain from differential allocation of resources to eggs in relation to embryo sex (Cordero et al. 2000), paternity (Krist et al. 2005), or hatching asynchrony (Howe 1976; Slagsvold et al. 1984). In reality, female ability to manipulate offspring phenotype adaptively by within-clutch differential allocation might be constrained. Within-clutch variation in egg size is usually rather small (Christians 2002) which might explain why intraclutch egg-size effects are limited (Krist et al. 2004).
Finally, it is possible to exchange clutches between pairs of nests that differ in egg size and to simultaneously study the effects of parental quality (as assessed by size of laid eggs) and egg size per se on offspring performance (Amundsen & Stokland 1990; Magrath 1992). Cross-fostering offers the possibility of studying experimentally the consequences of naturally occurring variability among clutches, which is usually greater than that among eggs within a clutch (Christians 2002). Consequently, this approach became a popular methodological tool for studies aimed at the trade-off between egg size and number not only in birds (19 studies performed to date – reviewed in Silva et al. 2007) but also in mammals (e.g. Oksanen et al. 2001) and insects (e.g. Lock et al. 2007). However, despite the advantages, this method has some potential drawbacks (Krist & RemeS 2004). First, cross-fostering does not decouple potential correlations between egg size and embryo genes. Consider for example nestling mass or tarsus length, traits which are often tested for their sensitivity to egg size. These traits are usually highly heritable (Merilä & Sheldon 2001) which means that larger mothers will have larger offspring as a result of inherited additive genes. Larger mothers have often been found to lay larger eggs (reviewed in Christians 2002). If these conditions occur together we might overestimate egg-size effects on offspring (Fox 1997; Krist & RemeS 2004). The solution to the problem may be relatively simple at least for some traits. Direct effects of genes
might be controlled for by including a parental midvalue of the studied trait among predictors of offspring traits (Krist & RemeS 2004). A second potential drawback is common to all methods – parents may adjust their post-natal care according to offspring state. They might, for example, feed chicks hatching from small eggs with a higher rate to compensate for their small initial size (Krist & RemeS 2004). In such a case, egg-size effects would be underestimated. Again, the confounding influence of post-natal parental care may be controlled for by inclusion of feeding rate among predictors of offspring performance (Krist & RemeS 2004).
Effects of feeding rate on offspring phenotype are additionally interesting in their own right. At present, feeding frequencies are studied mainly in the area of sexual selection. It is often tested whether parents adjust feeding frequency to the current value of the brood which might be affected by extra-pair paternity (review in Sheldon 2002) or mate quality (e.g. Moreno et al. 2004, Nakagawa et al. 2007). Such studies assume that feeding frequencies have an effect on the offspring but rarely test for these effects in details. Studies testing the validity of this assumption are rather limited (Royama 1966; Nur 1984; Ardia 2007; Schwagmeyer & Mock 2008). Furthermore, it must be noted here that if it is important to control for feeding frequency while testing for egg-size effects, the same is true when the main variable of interest is feeding frequency. I am not aware of any study that has simultaneously tested for effects of both egg size and feeding frequency on offspring quality.
Both studies of prenatal and post-natal parental effects are usually limited to short-term effects (i.e. when chicks are still in the nest). This is unfortunate since young often have the largest mortality shortly after fledging (Naef-Daenzer, Widmer & Nuber 2001). Consequently, survival of fledglings is usually the principal source of variation in female reproductive success (Clutton-Brock 1988; see also Mattsson & Cooper 2007). Not taking into account the stage when the opportunity for selection is at its highest might lead to biased conclusions (see also Russell et al. 2007a). I know of only two studies that have tested for the effects of feeding frequency on probability of offspring recruitment into the breeding population in birds (MacColl & Hatchwell 2003; Schwagmeyer & Mock 2008) and no such study among those that experimentally tested for egg-size effects on offspring quality.
To advance our understanding of how egg size affects offspring phenotype, I performed a cross-fostering experiment. I exchanged whole clutches between pairs of collared flycatchers’ nests and followed offspring until recruitment in the following years. I also captured parents and included their morphological traits in statistical models to control for possible direct genetic effects while estimating egg-size effects on offspring morphology. Furthermore, to control for the potentially confounding influence of post-natal care, I scored parental feeding frequencies and modelled their effects on offspring quality. In addition, I compared effects obtained in the cross-fostering experiment with those obtained from a set of unmanipulated nests.

Materials and methods
GENERAL METHODS
I conducted the study in the Velky Kosí® area (49°32′N, 17°04′E, 300–400 m a.s.l.), Czech Republic during 2000–08. In the study area, there were approximately 300 nest boxes in spruce [Picea abies (Linnaeus) Karsten, 2000–2005] and oak [Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl, 2002–2008] forest. I conducted the experiments with the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis Temminck), a small migratory passerine that easily adopts nest boxes for breeding. Females usually lay one egg per day and solely incubate clutches of three to eight eggs. Both collared flycatcher parents feed nestlings with invertebrate food for about 15 days until fledging.
During the time of laying, I monitored the nests daily and using a water-proof pen, marked newly-laid eggs with respect to laying sequence. I measured all eggs with a digital calliper to the nearest 0·01 mm. I computed egg size using Hoyt’s (1979) formula: egg size = 0·51 × breadth2 × length. I visited most nests daily around the presumed time of hatching. I weighed nestlings to the nearest 0·25 g using a Pesola spring balance at age 6 and 13 days. At age 13 days, I also measured their maximal wing length to the nearest 1 mm using a ruler and tarsus to the nearest 0·01 mm using a digital calliper. To obtain an estimate of T-cell mediated immune response, at age 12 days, I injected the right wing web of each chick with 0·1 mg phytohaemagglutinin in 20 μL of physiological saline solution. Before injection, I took two measurements of wing web thickness (to the nearest 0·01 mm) with a thickness gauge (Mitutoyo Quick-Mini, Kawasaki, Japan) that was adjusted to push with a constant pressure of one Newton. I re-measured wing web thickness 24 h (± 2 h) after injection. I calculated cell-mediated immune response of each chick as the difference in average thickness of wing web after injection minus the average thickness of wing web before injection. Using traps, I captured parents while feeding nestlings and measured them as per nestling measurements, except they were not injected with PHA. All young were ringed at age 6–13 days with aluminium rings. Since recruitment rate was high (see Appendix), I was able to recapture many young as breeding adults in subsequent years.
At age 6 and 12 days, I monitored parental feeding frequencies using video-cameras that were set a few metres apart from the nest box. I monitored provisioning behaviour for 70–185 min (mean ± SD: 87 ± 23 and 88 ± 22 min at age 6 and 12 days respectively). I disregarded the first 10 min of recording to minimize the effect of disturbance on estimates of parental feeding frequencies. The collared flycatchers were minimally influenced by the video-cameras and resumed their feeding behaviour just minutes after their installation.
CROSS-FOSTERING
I exchanged whole clutches between pairs of nests. I performed this experiment during 2005–07. In 2005, I exchanged each egg on the day it was laid for purposes of another study (Krist & Grim 2007). So during this year, nest pairs were matched by laying date but may have differed with respect to clutch size which was unknown at the commencement of exchanges. Consequently, clutch size differed by three in one pair, by two in four pairs, by one in 13 pairs and was the same in 14 pairs of nests. Clutch size manipulation (cross-fostered clutch minus original clutch) was added as a covariate in all statistical models (see below). During 2006–07, I exchanged complete clutches 1–4 days after clutch completion between nest pairs matched by the clutch size but
with date of laying of the last egg differing by up to two days. As a result, in the complete sample (2005–07), nest pairs differed in the date of the last egg by four days in one case, by three in two cases, by two in six cases, by one in 26 cases and did not differ in 50 cases. The difference between laying dates in cross-fostered and original nests was added as covariate in all analyses (see below). To account for the manipulation of clutches and laying date potentially biasing results, I repeated the analyses with nests that were not manipulated in these respects (n = 87 nests). Results from these models were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those from models fitted on the whole sample and therefore only the latter are presented.
I performed exchanges within 22 min (mean ± SD = 9·32 ± 4·87) during 2006–07. Hatchability was the same as in unmanipulated clutches (Appendix) which indicates that the handling of incubated eggs did not negatively affect embryo survival.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
All analyses are based on clutch/brood means. As the trade-off between number and size of offspring is solved at the level of individual females, clutch/brood means are appropriate levels for statistical analyses. In agreement with this view, most previous cross-fostering studies were analysed in this way (e.g. Magrath 1992; Smith et al. 1995; Russell et al. 2007b). Moreover, I would be unable to perform analyses based at the level of individual offspring, since due to high hatching synchrony these cannot be attributed to eggs.
Predictors
To test for effects of egg-size and feeding frequency on offspring performance, I fitted several models which had similar sets of predictors. (1) the size of cross-fostered egg (i.e. eggs from which nestlings actually hatched), (2) the size of original eggs (i.e. eggs that were originally laid on territory. I included size of original eggs in the models as they might be correlated with some aspect of parental or territory quality. In many previous cross-fostering studies, this factor had an influence on offspring performance (reviewed in Silva et al. 2007). (3) Feeding frequency per hour at age 6 days, (4) Feeding frequency per hour at age 12 days. Feeding frequencies were adjusted for a number of external factors and for brood size (Table 1) so that they represented a per-chick feeding frequency obtained under more standardized conditions. I included both feeding frequencies among predictors as they were only very weakly correlated (Table 2). (5) Number of care-givers. Most nests were attended by both parents but approximately one-ninth of them were attended by a single parent (Appendix), which was usually the female (only one brood was attended by the male only). I included this variable among predictors since I expected that a single parent may also decrease the quality of delivered diet and not just the feeding frequency. (6) Midvalue of genetic parents. I included this variable into the model to control for direct genetic effects (see Krist & RemeS 2004). When the response variable was offspring wing or tarsus length, the midvalue of genetic parents was just the mean of maternal and paternal wing and tarsus length respectively. In the models where the response variable was offspring weight (at age 6 and 13 days and when breeding), parental weight was adjusted to the time of their capture; so residuals from the regression of parental weight on offspring age at the time of capture were used [weight of females = 14·48 – 0·125 × offspring age (in days), F = 53·61, P < 0·001, R2 = 0·171, n = 262; weight of males = 13·38 – 0·033 × offspring age (in days),

Predictors 1–6 were the main factors of interest and as such were always retained in the final models. Predictors 7 and 8 were covariates that are usually very important for offspring performance. Grafen and Hails (2002, p. 218) recommend to retain such factors in final model regardless of their actual significance. I followed this guideline. Predictors 9 and 10 were included in the initial models only to ensure that my manipulation of clutch size and laying date did not bias the results. As they were otherwise of little interest in the present study, they were retained in the final models only if they were statistically significant. Since feeding frequencies cannot have a causal effect on hatchability, they were not included among predictors of the respective model. This was also the case for feeding frequency at age 12 days and nestling weight at age 6 days. Furthermore, I did not include parental wing length among the predictors of fledgling wing length since the latter is not fully grown at the time of fledging.
Note that inclusion of feeding frequencies together with size of original eggs among model predictors means that the latter variable functions here only as a surrogate of parental/territory quality other than that which is manifested in feeding frequencies. Similarly, the causal effect of the feeding frequencies on offspring performance could be underestimated if feeding frequencies were strongly correlated with the size of the original eggs. However, these correlations were weak (Table 2). To be sure that inclusion of the size of the original eggs among predictors did not bias estimates of feeding frequencies, I re-fitted all models without the former variable. Estimates of effect of feeding frequencies from these models were very similar to those from the models including size of original eggs, so only the latter are presented.
To test how biased the estimates of egg-size effects would be if feeding frequencies and genetic effects were not controlled for, I refitted all models without the midvalues of parental traits and feeding frequencies. Results of these models are only shown as a part of Fig. 1a.
Responses
I fitted models testing for the effects on offspring survival as a logistic regression (event/trial syntax) in Proc Genmod (SAS Institute 2003). (i) Hatchability: number of hatched eggs/clutch size.
(ii) Fledging success: number of fledged young/number of hatched young. (iii) Recruitment rate: number of recruited/number of fledged. Nests with predation events and with total failures were excluded from these survival analyses except for recruitment rate that was also based on nests with no recruits. I acknowledge that a small egg size might cause total failure at this stage (fledging–recruitment), in contrast to failure at the nestling stage which is usually caused by parental abandonment of the nest. These models had a binomial error structure, logit link function and statistics corrected for overdispersion by Deviance/df.
I fitted models testing for effects on offspring morphological/ life-history traits as general linear models in jmp (SAS Institute 1995). Young that did not fledge were excluded from computation of brood means. For offspring traits measured up to fledging, each survived nestling contributed one value for the computation of brood means. This was not the case for traits measured on recruits. Some offspring bred in a greater number of years and consequently offered more than one value for computation of brood means. I used all measurements to utilize all available information. Consequently, brood means of traits measured on recruits are based on 1–8 recruitmeasurements. Before averaging, I removed the effect of some confounding variables from the recruits’ values. I removed year effect from all measurements, sex effect from the recruits’ wing length and weight, as collared flycatchers are slightly dimorphic in these traits (Przbylo et al. 2000; M. Krist unpublished data), and the phase of breeding (i.e. offspring age when the recruit was captured) from weight of recruits. I used residuals from the (multiple) regression of the variable of interest on confounding factors listed above instead of raw measured values for computation of brood means. In the case of laying date, within-year median, not mean laying date was subtracted from actual laying date. I used only female recruits when testing eggsize effect on clutch size, as there is no evidence of a male effect on clutch size in this species (Sheldon, Kruuk & Merilä 2003).
Unmanipulated nests
I analysed data obtained on unmanipulated nests by basically the same methods as described above for the cross-fostering experiment except that some variables were not measured: feeding frequencies, nestling weight at 6, and fledging immunity.

more informative and therefore preferable method of summarizing results than conventionally used P values (Nakagawa & Cuthill 2007). Effect sizes presented here are correlation coefficients that were computed from the F-values of the respective statistical tests (see Table S1) according to the formula: r = [F/(F + DDF)], where DDF are error (denominator) degrees of freedom (Rosenthal 1994, p. 237). I set confidence limits for the correlation coefficient using z-transformation (Sokal & Rohlf 1995, p. 577).
Results
EGG-SIZE EFFECTS
Cross-fostering design
The size of cross-fostered eggs (i.e. eggs from which young hatched) was only weakly correlated with that of the original eggs (Table 2) which suggests that cross-fostering was efficient in decoupling potential correlations between egg size and parental/territory quality. This low correlation also means that it is reasonable to include size of both original and crossfostered eggs as predictors in the same models. Similarly, correlations among other variables used as predictors were not very strong (the highest one being r = 0·330; Table 2). Consequently, fitted models are unlikely to be affected by multicollinearity among predictors.
The size of cross-fostered eggs had generally positive effects on offspring performance both in the short and long term (Fig. 1a; Table 3). These effects were weak (i.e. correlation coefficient up to 0·1; Cohen 1988) to medium (r = 0·3) in magnitude. They were generally higher in reduced models (i.e. models without parental midvalues and feeding frequencies), but this upward bias was negligible in magnitude (Fig. 1a). The size of the original eggs (i.e. surrogate of parental/territory quality) had a generally smaller (and statistically unrecognizable) effect on offspring performance than the size of the cross-fostered eggs (Fig. 1a; Table 3).
The size of cross-fostered eggs had the greatest effect on offspring morphology. This holds from the age of 6 days (nestling mass) till adulthood (weight and wing length of recruits, Fig. 1a). The only measured morphological variable not affected by cross-fostered egg size was offspring mass at fledging. In contrast to morphology, the size of cross-fostered eggs had virtually no effect on offspring survival at any life

Effect sizes corresponding to relationships between egg size and offspring traits. The sign of the presented effects corresponds to the sign of statistical covariation between egg size and dependent variables. The exception is the egg-size effect on laying date, where a statistically negative effect means a biologically positive effect. The sample size used for computation of effect size can be inferred from degrees of freedom of the particular test (Table S1). (a) Effects obtained in the cross-fostering experiment. The effect sizes from full and reduced models are compared. The latter models do not include the parental mid-value and feeding frequencies among predictors. Labels ‘CF eggs’ and ‘OR eggs’ denote size of the cross-fostered egg (i.e. an egg from which chicks actually hatch) and original egg (i.e. an egg originally laid on the territory) respectively.

stage (hatchability, fledging success and recruitment rate, Fig. 1a). Similarly, nestling PHA immunity was unaffected by the size of the eggs from which they had hatched (Fig. 1a). Life-history traits (laying date and clutch size) were positively but weakly affected by the size of cross-fostered eggs (Fig. 1a).
Unmanipulated design
The egg-size effect obtained on unmanipulated clutches should in theory be equal to the sum of effects of crossfostered and original eggs in cross-fostering designs. This is roughly true if we compare the overall egg-size effects (crossfostering: 0·162, unmanipulated: 0·148, Table 3), but looking at individual traits, however, would not lead to this conclusion (Fig. 1a,b). In contrast to the cross-fostering design, egg
size in unmanipulated nests had a positive effect on offspring survival (hatchability and recruitment rate) and fledging weight, but negative effect on life-history traits of recruits (Fig. 1b).
EFFECTS OF PARENTAL PROVISIONING
Approximately one-ninth of nests were attended by only one parent (usually a female) at offspring age 12 days (Appendix). Broods attended by single parents were provisioned with a lower frequency. However, the difference was relatively small which indicates that parents working alone increased their level of parental effort (Fig. 2). At age 12 days, feeding frequency per offspring was the same in the two categories of nests (Fig. 2). This was attributable to a brood-size reduction that occurred more often in nests attended by single parents (see Fig. 3b).

Total feeding frequencies (+95% CL) to nests attended by both parents (black bars) and a single parent (white bars). Number of nests attended by a single parent was 10 and 16 at age 6 and 12 days respectively. The respective figure for nests attended by both parents was 135 and 122.
The number of care-givers had a consistent positive effect on nestling performance (Fig. 3b). However, in contrast to these clear short-term effects, the number of care-givers had no effect in the long term (Fig. 3b).
Parents fed offspring with greater frequency at age 12 days than at age 6 days (Fig. 2; Appendix). Feeding frequencies were uncorrelated between the two ages (Table 2) and had no clear directional relationship with offspring performance (Fig. 3a; Table 3). In line with expectations, feeding frequency at age 6 days had a positive effect on nestling survival (Fig. 3a). However, in contrast to my a priori expectations, morphology of fledglings was negatively correlated with the brood feeding frequency (Fig. 3a).
Egg size and feeding frequency: effects on altricial chicks 913 Discussion
EGG-SIZE EFFECTS
The size of cross-fostered eggs (i.e. eggs from which chicks had hatched) positively affected offspring morphology but had no effect on offspring survival and immunity. The size of eggs originally laid in the territory (surrogate of parental/ territory quality) had no significant effect on any of the offspring performance traits. If effects of egg size per se and parental quality were additive, their sum should be equal to egg-size effect in unmanipulated nests. However, this was usually not the case. This finding suggests that egg-size effects change temporally or differ between habitat types, since the majority of data on unmanipulated nests were obtained during different years (see Appendix) and from different habitat types (spruce and oak forest) to the data on crossfostered nests (oak forest only).
Ultimately, the relationship between egg size and offspring fitness is of interest. This relationship is difficult to study directly which is why I studied the effects on a suite of other offspring traits that might be related to their fitness. Clearly, this relationship will differ between the studied traits. Perhaps the most direct relationships to fitness are the three traits describing offspring survival at various life stages (hatchability, fledging success, and recruitment probability). Egg-size effects on these survival traits were absent in the cross-fostering design.
Although all three above-mentioned traits describe survival, fitness may be more sensitive to change in a stage with lower mean survival. Consider this example: the probability of successful hatching, fledging, and recruitment is 0·9, 0·8, and 0·2. The probability of an egg giving a recruit is the product of the three above probabilities: 0·9 × 0·8 × 0·2 = 0·144. An increase in survival of 10% added to the three stages would lead to an overall survival probability of 0·160, 0·162, and 0·216 respectively. Although this example is artificial, its values are similar to real ones (Appendix). The above conclusion is also supported by across-nest correlations between the probability of an egg giving a recruit and the survival probabilities of the three stages (rs = 0·057, 0·190, and 0·849 respectively; n = 141, only nests with at least one recruit included, data from the cross-fostered and unmanipulated designs pooled). Thus, opportunity for selection is highest in the stage after fledging (also see Clutton-Brock 1988) which stresses the need to consider this stage when thinking about the fitness benefits of parental care.
Additionally, morphological and immunological traits of fledglings are well known to affect post-fledging survival both in Ficedula flycatchers (Kruuk, Merilä & Sheldon 2001; Merilä, Kruuk & Sheldon 2001; Moreno et al. 2005) and in birds in general (Gebhardt-Henrich & Richner 1998). On the contrary, directional selection on traits expressed later in life may be relatively strong as in the case of laying date (Sheldon et al. 2003; Garant et al. 2007), while weak at best on adult morphology (Przybylo, Sheldon & Merilä 2000) and clutch size (Sheldon et al. 2003; but see Garant et al. 2007 for a more

Effect sizes corresponding to relationships between feeding frequencies or number of care-givers and offspring traits. The sign of the presented effects corresponds to the sign of statistical covariation between feeding frequencies and dependent variables. The exception is the effect on laying date, where a statistically negative effect means a biologically positive effect. The sample size used for computation of effect sizes can be inferred from degrees of freedom of the particular test (Table S1).

complicated picture). From these reasons, it may be problematic to average egg-size effects through the suite of offspring traits as I have done in the Table 3. Despite this limitation, I believe that similar illustrative information may be useful if one interprets it with caution.
The size of the eggs a female lays is usually regarded as an indicator of female or territory quality (Hörak et al. 1997, Silva et al. 2007). In most previous cross-fostering studies, the size of the original eggs had no effect on offspring traits immediately after hatching but this effect appeared later in the nestling period (reviewed in Silva et al. 2007). I did not find an effect of original eggs on offspring performance. It is usually assumed that the effect of the original eggs is mediated by increased post-natal care (e.g., parental feeding). If this was true in my study, the lack of the effect of original eggs would be expected since feeding rates were included in the same models as the original eggs. The latter variable then could become redundant due to the inclusion of a more direct
estimate of parental care into the statistical model. However, this was clearly not the case. The set of reduced models in which original eggs but not feeding frequencies were tested, gave very similar results (Fig. 1a).
The results of the full and reduced models were also very similar for the cross-fostered eggs. This means that although in theory, parental feeding and genetic effects may bias estimates of an egg-size effect in cross-fostering designs (Krist & RemeS 2004), this bias was not of practical importance in the present data set. To bias egg-size effect estimates substantially, parental feeding frequencies need to be both (i) strongly correlated with egg size, and (ii) highly influential for offspring performance. Neither of the two conditions arose in this study. These two conditions also did not arise simultaneously in the case of direct action of genes. Tarsus length was highly heritable (Table S1) but only mildly correlated with egg size (Table 2). Adult body mass was more strongly correlated with egg size (Table 2) but less heritable (Table S1). Similar

correlations between adult mass, tarsus length, and egg size were found in previous studies on collared (Hargitai et al. 2005) and pied flycatchers (Potti 1993). This suggests that in Ficedula flycatchers, egg-size effects may be properly estimated without the need for control of genetic effects.
However, this may not be the general rule. In mammals, for example, direct genetic and maternal effect on offspring performance were strongly positively correlated in both laboratory (Riska, Rutledge & Atchley 1985) and field settings (McAdam et al. 2002). In arthropods, there was usually found positive correlation between egg size and offspring performance (Fox and Czesak 2000). However, detailed studies on seed beetles revealed that offspring body size is from the most part genetically controlled with little room for maternal effects (Fox 1994). In line with this, positive correlation between egg size and offspring body size which is observable in nonexperimental settings, disappear if egg mass is experimentally manipulated (Fox 1997). These results suggest that correlation between heritable body size and egg size confounds relationship between egg size and offspring body size (Fox 1997). To conclude, both correlation between parental characters (egg size, feeding frequencies, body size) and their effects on offspring quality may be speciesand context specific. Consequently, more studies unravelling causal relationship between egg size and offspring quality are needed for better understanding of the trade-off between quality and number of offspring.
FEEDING FREQUENCIES
The number of care-givers was an influential predictor of nestling performance but had no effect in the long term. It is not very surprising to find that two parents provide better care than a single parent, although the opposite is also theoretically possible if parents heavily negotiate over care (McNamara et al. 2003). Although some support has been found for the latter scenario (Griggio & Pilastro 2007), the majority of previous studies provided results similar to our own (e.g. Markman, Yom-Tov & Wright 1996; Russell et al. 2007a,b), including other studies on flycatchers (Sheldon 2002; Huk & Winkel 2006). Females working alone increased the frequency of feeding visits [Fig. 2; if present, the male provided about half of all feedings (M. Krist, unpublished data)] but they did not fully compensate for the males’ absence (Fig. 2). This would suggest that the poor performance of offspring in these nests is caused by an insufficient feeding frequency. However, this possibility could be excluded because feeding frequencies were controlled for in these tests. Notably, the same pattern was found in a previous study on this species (Sheldon 2002).
This, at first sight may seem somewhat paradoxical but the result can be explained in two ways. First, secondary females might decrease either the quality of delivered food or quantity per visit. Recently, it has been found that the size of delivered prey was more important for offspring fitness than just the frequency of delivery (Schwagmeyer & Mock 2008). Second, the effect of number of care-givers on offspring can in fact be
driven by feeding frequencies but I might have been unable to control for this effect adequately. I measured feeding frequencies in a limited time-window while effect of number of attending parents was spread over the whole nestling period in the majority of cases. Feeding frequencies obtained in this limited time-window may only be a poor estimate of the feeding frequency over the whole nestling period. The lack of correlation between parental feeding frequencies at offspring age 6 and 12 days suggests that both of them cannot be good estimates of total feeding frequency.
On the other hand, both feeding frequencies were correlated in the expected direction with a number of other factors (Table 1, Fig. 2). Feeding frequency increased with number and age of young, which makes intuitive sense, and decreased during the day, a pattern that was also found in other previous studies (e.g. Moreno et al. 2004). These results suggest that feeding frequencies had some explanative power despite the limited time-window in which I measured them. It should also be mentioned here that most previous studies that dealt with feeding frequencies used a similar or a more limited timewindow (but see e.g. Saino, Calza & Møller 1997; MacColl & Hatchwell 2003; Schwagmeyer & Mock 2008 for more detailed monitoring), and despite this, the majority of these studies reported a positive correlation between feeding frequency and some offspring trait.
Another explanation for the lack of clear effect of feeding frequency on offspring performance may be varying causality. Clear causality exists in the relationship between egg-size and offspring performance. Egg size can affect offspring performance while offspring performance cannot affect the size of the egg from which this offspring hatched. Unlike this case, feeding frequency can affect offspring performance but parents may also adjust feeding frequency to offspring state. Parents in nests with poorly developed young close to fledging might increase the feeding frequency to improve offspring condition at fledging, which is important for subsequent post-fledging survival (Kruuk et al. 2001; Merilä et al. 2001). Consequently, if causality goes from feeding frequency to offspring state, the sign of the correlation between the two variables would be positive, while both positive and negative correlations may arise if causality is reversed. These two effects might also cancel one another out resulting in no correlation between feeding frequency and offspring performance.
Conclusions
On the between-clutch/brood level, egg size per se (i.e. the size of cross-fostered eggs) affected offspring morphology in both the short and long term. As larger fledglings usually survive better than smaller ones (Merilä et al. 2001; Kruuk et al. 2001), this might in theory confer fitness benefits of larger eggs. However, in this study, recruitment was independent of egg size and egg size did not affect survival at earlier stages (hatchability and fledging success). Although egg size positively affected adult morphology, this trait can confer small benefits in terms of fitness (Przybylo et al. 2000). Con-

sequently, it is not clear whether a larger egg indeed confers fitness benefits for the offspring.
Egg size increased offspring hatchability and recruitment probability on unmanipulated nests. However, in this case it is not clear whether these effects were caused by egg size per se or by parental/territory quality. It is also possible that egg size has a positive effect on offspring only in some years and/or environments (see e.g. Smith & Bruun 1998). To conclude, although sample size was solid in this study, an even larger sample size and spread over more years and habitats may be needed to find conclusive evidence that, on the between-clutch level, larger eggs do indeed confer fitness benefits to offspring. It is also necessary to stress that egg size is only one aspect of egg quality. Egg composition, which was not target of this study, may have important consequences for offspring regardless of egg size (e.g. Blount, Houston & Møller 2000; Gil 2003; but see RemeS et al. 2007).
In contrast to a consistent positive effect of number of care-givers on nestling traits, there was no clear directional relationship between feeding frequency and the latter variables. This may be caused either by the limited time-window in which feeding frequencies were measured, lack of information on diet quality or parental adjustment of feeding frequencies to offspring state. Two principal improvements of studies dealing with feeding frequencies would be (i) to cover a greater portion of the nestling period by observation of parental feeding frequencies, and (ii) to measure also prey size and quality delivered to nestlings. At present, new technologies, such as automatic recorders based on PIT tag technology (e.g., Ottoson, Backman & Smith 1997) and small microcameras that are easy to position close to nestlings (Qvarnström et al. 2007) offer the possibility to solve these issues.
