 abstract: Mean adult size has been used as the traditional measure of body size to explain trends of insular gigantism and dwarfism in a wide array of taxa. However, patterns of variation in body size at birth have received surprisingly little attention, leaving open the possibility that adult body-size differences are nonadaptive consequences of selection acting on neonate body size. Here I used an empirical and correlative approach to test this hypothesis in a mosaic of 12 island and mainland snake populations in Australia. Data collected on 597 adult and 1,084 neonate tiger snakes showed that (1) both adult and neonate mean body sizes varied strongly across populations; (2) prey diversity and size convincingly explained birth-size variations: birth size—notably, gape size—correlated with prey size; (3) neonate snout-vent length was significantly correlated with neonate gape size; and (4) neonate snout-vent length was significantly correlated with adult snout-vent length. Postnatal growth rates recorded under common-garden conditions differed across populations and were correlated with mean prey size. These data collectively suggest that (1) prey size is the main driver for the evolution of body size at birth in gape-limited predators, (2) adult size variations may reflect selective forces acting on earlier life stages, and (3) adult size variations may also reflect resource availability during ontogeny (notably, prey diversity).

 small-bodied animals become larger (in mammals, snakes, lizards, fish, mollusks, and insects; Case 1978; Lomolino 1985; Morse et al. 1988; Brown and Maurer 1989; Brown et al. 1993; Blackburn and Gaston 1994; Brown 1995; Marquet and Taper 1998; Maurer 1998; Roy et al. 2000; Clegg and Owens 2002; Keogh et al. 2005; Meiri 2007). Predominant explanations for such patterns include the effects of ecological release (from predation, parasitism, and interspecific competition) and resource limitation on islands (intraspecific competition; Grant 1965; Case 1978; Lomolino 1985, 2005; McNab 2002).
The generality of the island-rule hypothesis remains very much debated, however (Boback 2003; Meiri et al. 2006, 2008; Meiri 2007). Indeed, while the island rule may explain trends of island dwarfism and gigantism to some extent (Case 1978), shifts in island body size may also arise through a complex mosaic of mechanisms that occur on different but overlapping timescales, such as genetic drift, phenotypic plasticity, and sexual selection (Madsen and Shine 1992; Barton 1996; Wikelski and Trillmich 1997; Wikelski et al. 1997; Whittaker 1998; Willemsen and Hailey 1999; Losos et al. 2000; Schluter 2001; Meiri 2007; Calsbeek and Cox 2010), as well as many abiotic factors, such as island size, isolation time, latitude, and distance to the mainland (reviewed in Lomolino 2005).
Further limitations may arise from a potentially confounding mode of measuring body size: mean adult size has always been used as a traditional measure of body size in the literature (see references above). On the other hand, patterns of variation for body size at birth in island animal populations have received, to my knowledge, no attention at all. Because birth size has not been integrated into studies of body-size evolution on islands, a possibility remains that adult body-size differences may largely be a nonadaptive consequence of selection acting on different life stages. Despite the considerable amount of research aimed
 Introduction
Geographically isolated animal populations have long been prime study models for the evolution of body size (Gorman 1968; Gotelli and Graves 1990; Losos 1995). Hypotheses such as the island rule (Foster 1964; Van Valen 1973) have stemmed from the observation that many islands harbor either giant or dwarf forms of their mainland conspecifics: large-bodied animals become smaller and

 Birth-Size Evolution on Islands 757
 at deciphering patterns of body-size evolution by using adult body size (see references above), the patterns observed across animal populations may possibly be better explained using size measurements at birth.
This lack of research focus on early life stages is surprising, considering (1) neonate survival is a sine qua non condition to establishment and persistence of newly isolated populations, (2) birth size largely influences adult size in many taxa (Olsson and Madsen 2001; Kaplan and Phillips 2006; Ong 2006; Garant et al. 2007; Wilson et al. 2009; Uller and Olsson 2010), and (3) birth size is a prime determinant of survival and fitness (Clutton-Brock 1988; Boltnev et al. 1998; Kissner and Weatherhead 2005). Furthermore, because of their smaller sizes, neonates and juveniles may experience quite different selective pressures compared with adults, notably in respect to predation and foraging success (Carrier 1996; Herrel and Gibb 2006). This is especially relevant to gape-limited predators (i.e., snakes, fish, birds), for which distinct ontogenetic shifts in prey type occur throughout their lives (Godley 1980; Saint Girons 1980; Mushinsky et al. 1982; Graham et al. 2007), as prey suitable to adults are usually too large to be swallowed by smaller-gaped younger individuals (Wheelwright 1985; Nilsson and Bro ̈nmark 2000; Aubret and Shine 2010a).
The aim of this article is to test the hypothesis that patterns of variation in adult body size in gape-limited predators are a nonadaptive consequence of strong selection acting on neonate gape size in order to match prey size. For this hypothesis to be supported, the following predictions must be verified: (1) neonate size, and especially gape size, will match prey size across populations; (2) neonate gape size and body size will be positively correlated; (3) neonate and adult body sizes will be positively correlated; and (4) because growing fast may be a way to increase gape size (Aubret and Shine 2010a), postnatal growth rates will match prey size across populations.
In order to verify these predictions, I collected data from 12 different island and mainland populations of the Australian tiger snake Notechis scutatus (Keogh et al. 2005), to describe variation in (1) mean adult body size, (2) mean neonate body size, (3) range and size of prey available to each population, and (4) growth rates and food-conversion rates in a common-garden experiment involving juvenile snakes from seven different populations.
Material and Methods
Model Species
Tiger snakes are large, venomous, elapid snakes that are widely distributed from western to eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania. Tiger snakes also occur on numerous
 offshore islands. Most island populations were isolated between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago by rising sea levels (Rawlinson 1974; Schwaner 1985), although a small number of these populations are the result of recent human introductions (i.e., Carnac Island, Trefoil Island; Aubret and Shine 2009).
Mainland tiger snakes typically occur in swampy areas, feed mostly on frogs, and reach a mean body size (snoutvent length [SVL]) of 78–92 cm (Shine 1987; Schwaner and Sarre 1990). Most island populations, however, survive on a diet of squamates and/or nesting birds (Shine 1977, 1987; Schwaner 1985; Aubret et al. 2004b, 2006; Bonnet et al. 2005). This shift in diet has generated dramatic bodysize differences in adult island tiger snakes: populations of giants are found on islands containing seabird colonies (SVL 1 1.5 m, body mass 1 2 kg; Worrell 1958; Schwaner and Sarre 1988; Shine 1991; Aubret et al. 2004b), while populations of dwarves occur where only small lizards are available as prey (SVL ! 0.8 m and body mass ! 700 g; Boback 2003; Keogh et al. 2005).
Genetic divergence among tiger snake populations across this extensive range is remarkably low (e.g., only 1.4% when comparing mtDNA markers among western Australian and southeastern Australian populations). Within southeastern Australia, the maximum genetic divergence is only 0.38% between populations of island giants, island dwarves, and mainland snakes (Keogh et al. 2005). Nonetheless, ecological, morphological, and behavioral traits of Notechis differ strongly between mainland and island populations, as well as among adjacent island populations. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of heritable differences among tiger snake populations (notably, in scalation [Aubret et al. 2004b], feeding preferences [Aubret et al. 2006], and defensive behavior [Aubret et al. 2011]). Most traits displayed some level of plasticity (defensive behavior [Bonnet et al. 2005], locomotor performances [Aubret and Shine 2007, 2008], relative head growth [Aubret et al. 2004b], and thermoregulation strategies [Aubret and Michniewicz 2010; Aubret and Shine 2010b]).
Body Size in Neonatal and Adult Tiger Snakes
Eleven tiger snake populations were regularly surveyed during numerous field sessions from 2001 to 2010 (see fig. 1). Study sites included Carnac Island (normal-size adult snakes), Herdsman Lake (dwarf-size adult snakes), and Joondalup Lake (dwarf) in Western Australia; Williams Island (giant-size adult snakes), Reevesby Island (giant), and Hopkins Island (giant) in South Australia; Trefoil Island (normal), Christmas Island (giant), New-Year Island (giant), and Swan Island (giant) in Tasmania; and mainland Tasmania (Circular Head area; normal). A total of

 567 snakes were captured by hand; for these SVL was measured (to the nearest 􏱠0.5 cm), and they were weighed (electronic scale 􏱠1 g) and individually marked by scale clipping. All were released within 24 h at the exact site of their capture, with the exception of 72 pregnant females that were brought back to the laboratory (from 2001 to 2003, at the University of Western Australia; from 2006 to 2008, at the University of Sydney).
The group of 72 pregnant females comprised 21 from Carnac Island, 22 from Herdsman Lake, 4 from Joondalup Lake, 4 from Williams Island, 4 from Reevesby Island, 3 from Trefoil Island, 6 from Christmas Island, 4 from NewYear Island, and 4 from mainland Tasmania. Pregnant females were caught early in their gestation (in January and February of each year) and kept under common-garden conditions until parturition (in March and April of each year). Females were housed individually (cages measured 30 cm # 40 cm # 30 cm) in a temperature-controlled room (27􏱟C by day and 20􏱟C by night). Food was offered once a week (dead mice and chicks), and water was provided ad libitum. A heat source provided a basking opportunity four times a day (4 # 15 min/day; high-pressure Na􏱘 lamp, 600 W). A total of 1,066 neonates were obtained from 72 litters. Neonates were isolated from their mothers and measured shortly after birth (!24 h) for SVL (􏱠0.1
 cm) and body mass (􏱠0.1 g) and were sexed by eversion of the hemipenes. Jaw length (gape-size indicator; Aubret and Shine 2010a) was also measured, using a digital caliper (􏱠0.01 mm). For each litter, we calculated average neonate body mass, SVL, jaw length, and body condition index (BCI) to take into account maternal effects, so that each litter (irrespective of litter size) carried an equivalent statistical weight in the analyses. Values for BCI were calculated as the residual values of the linear regression of log-transformed body mass against log-transformed SVL (Jayne and Benett 1990; Bonnet and Naulleau 1994).
Complementary data on snake body size (including from 30 adult snakes from various origins and one complete litter of 18 Reevesby Island snakes) were gathered from museum collections (South Australian Museum, Adelaide; Western Australian Museum, Perth; and Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart) as well as from published literature (for Chappell Island tiger snakes, Schwaner 1985; Schwaner and Sarre 1988, 1990).
Prey Assemblages
Data on prey available to each population were gathered from personal field observations, published literature (Schwaner 1985; Schwaner and Sarre 1988, 1990; Rob-

Prey were measured for body mass and maximum circumference (the major constraint for swallowing success in snakes; Shine 2002), using a nonelastic thread. The focus was on prey that were likely to be encountered and consumed by neonate tiger snakes in their natural environment. Species that were obviously too large to be swallowed or too rare to constitute a staple prey of neonate snakes were not considered (i.e., king’s skink Egernia kingie, growling grass frog Litoria raniformis, eastern banjo frog Limnodynastes dumerili, bush rat Rattus fuscipes). It is worth noting that prey species that are too large as adults may be taken as juveniles by young snakes. This may constitute a potential albeit limited bias in the calculation of average prey-size estimates (see “Results”). More importantly, prey abundance, although hard to quantify, may play a distinctive role in young snake ecology rather than (or in addition to) prey diversity. However, this role is likely to remain marginal because (1) the benefits of feeding on one large prey item may largely outweigh those of feeding on numerous smaller prey items in terms of energy acquisition and subsequent growth (toward sexual maturity; Grafen 1988; Andersson 1994; Madsen and Shine 2000) and (2) risks accumulate with repeated small-prey feeding events (increased basking time and predator exposure; Huey 1974; Huey and Slatkin 1976).
Growth Rates
This common-garden experiment was performed during three different years, under consistent laboratory and snake-housing conditions (as described above). I randomly selected 191 neonates (95 females and 96 males)
 from a total of 595 neonates born to 31 pregnant females in March and April of 2006, 2007, and 2008 from the following populations: Carnac Island (8 litters, 36 neonates), Joondalup Lake (4 litters, 25 neonates), Williams Island (3 litters, 30 neonates), Christmas Island (6 litters, 27 neonates), New-Year Island (3 litters, 28 neonates), Trefoil Island (3 litters, 19 neonates), and Tasmania (4 litters, 26 neonates). From 3 weeks of age, the young snakes were offered small dead mice (ranging from 1.0 to 7.0 g in size) weekly. Feeding was precisely monitored for each snake (amount of food consumed per meal). Body mass and SVL were recorded every 2 months throughout the 182-day experiment. I calculated growth and food-conversion rates (i.e., gram of snake body mass / increase in body length produced per gram of food ingested) for each individual over the course of the experiment. All data were log transformed before statistical analysis was performed.
Results
Body Size in Neonatal and Adult Tiger Snakes
Comparative data and statistical analyses are presented in
table 1 for neonates and table 2 for adults. Differences
were dramatic: Chappell Island adult snakes were on av-
erage 3.4 times heavier and 1.6 times longer than Herds-
man Lake snakes. Differences among neonate populations
were also considerable: Williams Island neonates were on
average 2.5 times heavier and 1.3 times longer at birth
than Reevesby Island neonates. While adult and neonate
body mass strongly differed across populations, there was
no significant correlation between the two variables (linear
regression: log[adult body mass] against log[birth body
mass], R p 0.47; F p 2.26; P p .17). However, adult 1,8
and neonate SVL values proved to be significantly cor-

Prey Assemblages
1,7
Prey assemblages were variable from western to eastern Australia, between mainland and island populations, and among islands (table 3). I calculated average prey mass and circumference (arithmetic means for all prey types present at each given site; table 4). Using these data, Spearman rank-order correlations showed a significant correlation between prey body mass and neonate body mass (N p 10; R p 0.76; t p 3.33; P ! .011; fig. 3a), prey body mass and neonate jaw length (N p 9; R p 0.77; t p 3.22; P ! .015), and prey circumference and neonate jaw length (N p 9; R p 0.67; t p 2.40; P ! .047; fig. 3b).
Growth Rates
The amount of food consumed by each individual neonate remained similar across all groups (45.42 􏱠 3.04 g on average; F6, 184 p 0.75; P p .62). Sexes were pooled for subsequent analyses, as sexes did not significantly differ for any of the measured variables (see below; all P 1 .12). Populations significantly differed in terms of daily growth for body mass and SVL (F6, 184 p 21.88, P ! .0001 and F6, 184 p 6.03, P ! .0001, respectively) as well as body mass and SVL conversion rates (F6, 184 p 29.22, P ! .0001 and F p 9.18, P ! .0001, respectively). Remarkably, Wil-
 liams Island snakes (which had the largest neonates of all seven populations) produced almost twice as much body mass (14.28 􏱠 2.19 g increase) over the course of the experiment as Trefoil Island snakes (which had relatively smaller neonates; 7.57 􏱠 2.72 g increase) for a comparable amount of food ingested. Furthermore, Carnac Island juveniles grew an average of 10.60 􏱠 2.08 cm over the course of the experiment, while Joondalup Lake snakes grew only 8.30 􏱠 1.66 cm. Daily growth in body mass was strongly correlated with body mass at birth (N p 191; t p 8.03; R p 0.51; P ! .0001) and with daily growth in SVL (N p 191; t p 7.74; R p 0.49; P ! .0001). Finally, across populations, daily growth rate in SVL was significantly correlated with mean prey circumference (N p 7; R p 0.77; t p 2.74; P ! .041).
Discussion
Adult body size is known to vary greatly across island and mainland populations of tiger snakes in Australia, from dwarf (i.e., Roxby Island, Herdsman Lake) to giant snakes (Chapell Island, Williams Island; Schwaner and Sarre 1988; Keogh et al. 2005; Aubret and Shine 2009). This field study confirmed this variation and extended the knowledge by demonstrating that body-size variation is also a feature of neonate tiger snakes, with the occurrence of dwarf (Reevesby Island, Joondalup Lake) and giant neonates (Williams Island, Hopkins Island). In the context of resource limitations driving body-size variation in island animals (Grant 1965; Case 1978; Lomolino 1985, 2005; McNab 2002), it is notable that prey suites available to neonates (type, size, and number of prey) also vary from site to site, prompting the following question: are adult body-size variations the nonadaptive consequence of se-

All four predictions outlined in “Introduction” were verified: (1) birth size (body mass, jaw length) was significantly correlated with prey size (prey mass, prey circumference) across populations, (2) neonate jaw length (i.e., indicative of gape size; Vincent et al. 2006; Aubret and Shine 2010a) increased with both neonate body mass and SVL values, (3) neonate and adult SVL were positively correlated, and (4) growth rate in SVL matched prey circumference across populations of tiger snakes. These results collectively pinpoint prey size as the main driver for the evolution of body size at birth in gape-limited predators and they support the hypothesis that adult body size
reflects birth-size variations in gape-limited predators.
 The situation is, however, more complex. First, isolation time was shown to play a significant role in the evolution of body size in island snakes, where phenotypic plasticity followed by genetic assimilation fine-tuned neonate body size to larger prey (West-Eberhard 2003; Aubret and Shine 2009). Experimental studies showed that tiger snake neonates from recently isolated populations (i.e., !100 years; Carnac Island, Trefoil Island) could accelerate head growth, and hence swallowing performance, in response to large prey (Aubret and Shine 2009). On long-isolated islands, however, tiger snakes were born larger but exhibited no plasticity in response to prey size (i.e., 16,000 years; Williams Island). It was proposed that canalized versions of the relevant traits (rates of head growth) may have outcompeted plastic versions, because matching prey size

  via plasticity incurred fitness costs (i.e., genetic assimilation; Aubret et al. 2010a). Nevertheless, irrespective of the mechanism by which juvenile phenotype matches prey size (i.e., via plasticity rather than at birth; Aubret and Shine 2009), adult body-size variations may still reflect selection for body/head size acting on earlier life stages. Second, exceptions to the correlation between adult and birth SVL exist. On long-isolated Reevesby Island (South Australia), dwarf neonates (the smallest of all populations sampled) grow to giant adult size (and excellent body condition). This suggests a role for environmental factors (such as food availability throughout ontogeny) in the determination of adult body size, and is reflected by the fact that although neonatal and adult SVL were correlated, neonatal and adult body mass were not. The possibility that plasticity in growth in response to food intake can be an important determinant of adult body size in gape-limited predators was confirmed by laboratory experiments (Madsen and Shine 1993; Mori and Hasegawa 2002; Keogh et al. 2005; Aubret and Shine 2007).
Finally, variation in mean adult body size can be achieved via shifts in growth rates throughout ontogeny (i.e., energy allocation toward growth rather than reserves; Gould and Johnston 1972; Parker and Plummer 1987; Bronikowski 2000). This possibility was validated by studies of juvenile tiger snakes that were fed similar amounts of food in a common-garden experiment: growth rates in body mass and SVL significantly varied across the seven populations examined. Larger individuals grew faster than smaller individuals as a result of higher food-conversion rates. Size-related differences in metabolism may explain some of the differences in energy use across individuals
 and populations, because smaller organisms have higher metabolic rates than comparatively larger ones (Kleiber’s Law; Kleiber 1947). Alternatively, local adaptation may have fine-tuned growth rates and/or metabolism to contrasted island environments (Bronikowski 2000; Brown et al. 2004). Fast growth rates in animals have significant implications for individual fitness throughout life (swallowing abilities, growth, predator evasion, age at maturity, male rivalry, reproductive output; Chamaille-Jammes et al. 2006; Warner and Shine 2007; Aubret and Shine 2010a; Uller and Olsson 2010; Wapstra et al. 2010). This last possibility seems to be supported by the fact that growth rate in SVL matched prey circumference across populations of tiger snakes. Faster-growing juvenile snakes increase in gape size along with body size, and thus the spectrum of prey they are capable of swallowing widens at a higher rate. This ability may be critical in an environment where only mediumand large-sized prey are available (see below). Hence, differential growth rates in young snakes may be adaptive (driven by available prey size) and thus further contribute to adult body-size variations.
Geographic isolation often translates into novel evolutionary routes in recently isolated animal populations (Darwin 1845; Losos et al. 1997; Wikelski and Trillmich 1997; Whittaker 1998). In predatory animals (and their progeny), the outcome of such a scenario may depend on their ability to cope with unfamiliar prey types (McNab 1994, 2001; Phillips and Shine 2004; King et al. 2006; Herrel et al. 2008; Carlsson et al. 2009). As gape-limited predators, small snakes (having small heads) may be able to consume only prey that is small enough for them to

 subdue and swallow (Aubret and Shine 2010a). While mainland tiger snakes are renowned for their small and numerous babies (i.e., Joondalup Lake; Cogger 2000), this strategy may have shifted toward new adaptive peaks on islands where prey diversity is reduced and average prey size is larger than that of the staple mainland frogs and skinks (Aubret et al. 2004b, 2006; Keogh et al. 2005). Consequently, selective pressures (survival, intrasexual competition, etc.) may have reset the trade-off between offspring quality and quantity (Lack 1947; Stearns 1992)
 toward larger babies that are capable of swallowing larger prey. Energy use is then optimized toward growth rather than storage, in order to promote rapid growth; consequently, these individuals attain a very large mean adult body size (Williams Island, Chappell Island; Schwaner and Sarre 1988). However, where numerous prey types of varying size exist (and, importantly, where very small prey exist), selective pressure appears to have shifted toward numerous smaller babies reaching large adult sizes (i.e., Reevesby Island), where the larger adult size is powered

   Figure 3: Spearman rank-order correlations (a) between neonate body mass and prey body mass (Np10; Rp0.76; tp3.33; P! .011) and (b) between prey circumference and neonate jaw lengths (Np9; Rp0.67; tp2.40; P!.047).
by the increasing prey size throughout life (from small skinks to nesting bird chicks). Finally, where only small prey are available (small skinks), neonates were born small and adults remained moderate in size (Roxby Island; Shine 1987; Schwaner and Sarre 1988; Keogh et al. 2005).
The matching of neonate body size to prey size may take the form of an evolutionary bottleneck via a stage where both plastic individuals (for jaw size; Aubret et al. 2004a; Aubret and Shine 2009) and individuals born with a larger head are selected, because failing to swallow the first prey would greatly reduce survival chance and fitness. Concurrently with or immediately following this bottleneck, shifts in the trade-off between quality and quantity of offspring may act as a positive feedback loop that favors
                                                                                                  adult females that produce the highest-possible number of young that are as close as possible to the lower size limit imposed by prey size. Importantly, this lower size limit is dictated by the size of prey available to neonate gape-limited predators. The size of available prey to gapelimited predators thus appears as a new factor in the evolution of the trade-off between offspring quality and quantity. Finally, trends in the evolution of adult body size on islands have contributed to the theory of an optimal body size (in mammals: Lomolino 1985; Brown et al. 1993; but see Meiri et al. 2005; in snakes: Boback and Guyer 2003). The results of this study instead suggest that birth size is the optimized trait, at least in gape-limited predators, and it also suggests that adult size changes may be best explained by phenotypic plasticity rather than direct responses to selection (Madsen and Shine 1993).
In conclusion, these empirical and experimental data suggest that variations in adult size in gape-limited predators are mostly a nonadaptive consequence of (1) strong selective regimes acting on neonate body size (especially gape size) and juvenile growth rates and (2) resource availability throughout ontogeny (plasticity in growth related to prey abundance and prey diversity). Prey size appears to be the main driver for the evolution of body size at birth in gape-limited predators, which adds a new component to body-size evolution on islands and further challenges the idea of an optimal adult body size (Meiri et al. 2005). Future studies may benefit from recording birth size in other geographically isolated taxa, as patterns of body-size evolution on islands may be better explained by variations within this life stage rather than in adult size. Future studies may also empirically test the correlative results of this study by assessing the swallowing abilities of neonates from populations with different-sized neonates provided a broad range of prey types and sizes.
