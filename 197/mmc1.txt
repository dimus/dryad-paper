Figure S1. The phylogeny of Jamaican and Puerto Rican Anolis lizards examined in this study. Branch lengths are proportional to time since divergence. Highlighted on the phylogeny is the ancestor reconstruction of neighbour distance mapped using maximum likelihood, assuming a threshold cutoff of 5 m, that was used in the evolutionary model ‘threshold:likelihood’. The parsimony reconstruction differed in the respect that only the Jamaican lineages leading directly to A. opalinus and A. lineatopus were reconstructed with neighbour distances greater than 5 m; the Puerto Rican reconstructions remained unchanged. Shown for reference are the corresponding headbob speeds for each taxon.
