Abstract
Populations of fall Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Columbia River are divided among two
evolutionarily significant units: lower Columbia River fall Chinook salmon (or “tules”) in the lower portion of the river and upriver “brights” (URBs) in the upper portion. The two lineages migrate together through portions of the lower Columbia River but spawn allopatrically. Little White Salmon National Fish Hatchery has been releasing URBs adjacent to what was historically exclusively tule spawning habitat in the White Salmon River for approximately 22 years. Tules and URBs now spawn in sympatry in the adjacent White Salmon River, and potential introgression between these two lineages has been identified as a genetic risk of the hatchery program. To assess the extent of introgression, we analyzed 13 microsatellite loci in juveniles taken from the White Salmon River in three consecutive years. Assignment tests revealed that juveniles leaving the White Salmon River from March to early May resembled tules, while those leaving from late May to June resembled URBs. Model-based hybrid detection revealed that between 4.3% and 15.0% of the juveniles in each year were tule × URB hybrids. No hybrid adults were detected in any of the collections examined. The divergence between the tule and URB populations in the White Salmon River was comparable to that between allopatric populations representing the two lineages. Although hybrid juveniles are produced in the wild, we found no evidence that they survive to return as adults or successfully cross back into the parental populations. The separation between the two fall Chinook salmon lineages thus appears to be based on intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors.
  Genetic divergence is expected to accumulate among isolated populations due to mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. When allopatric populations are brought into secondary contact they may or may not hybridize based on the degree of divergence and the mechanisms responsible for the differences. If divergence among the taxa is based only on extrinsic factors (e.g., physical separation), secondary contact should result in introgression. Conversely, if divergence is based on both extrinsic and intrinsic factors (e.g., physical or behavioral attributes of the populations themselves; Taylor 2004), then selection against

hybridization or hybrids may allow both parental taxa to persist in the new shared environment. For example, in the case of salmonids, divergent (and heritable) migratory life histories among taxa might limit introgression among those taxa (Utter 2001). When introgression does occur among distinct genetic lineages, it can lead to the breakdown of populationspecific adaptations (Gharrett and Smoker 1991; Gilk et al. 2004; Tymchuk et al. 2007) and reduce genetic variation, limiting future adaptive potential. The negative impacts of hybridization following secondary contact have been well documented among

several salmonid taxa (e.g., Boyer et al. 2008; DeHaan et al. 2010; Muhlfeld et al. 2009).
The lower Columbia River (LCR) Chinook salmon evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) includes all native naturally spawned populations of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha residing below impassable natural barriers from the mouth of the Columbia River to the crest of the Cascade Range just east of the White Salmon River (Figure 1; NMFS 1999). Three Chinook salmon runs occur within the LCR Chinook salmon ESU: spring, early fall, and late fall.
The two fall runs of Chinook salmon in the Columbia River Gorge are distinguished by maturation characteristics, with the early run (called tule fall Chinook salmon) exhibiting advanced maturation and darkened skin at freshwater entry (Myers et al. 2006). Upriver “bright” (URB) fall Chinook salmon lack these secondary characteristics, having brighter skin at freshwater entry and maturing 1–3 months after freshwater entry.
The migrations of returning tule and URB fall Chinook salmon adults coincide at Bonneville Dam between mid-August and September.
Tule fall Chinook salmon historically spawned in the lower few kilometers of the Wind River, Little White Salmon River, White Salmon River, Hood River, Eagle Creek, and Herman Creek (Fulton 1968) and in the main-stem Columbia River upstream of Bonneville Dam (Dauble et al. 2003). Historically, tules in the White Salmon and Little White Salmon rivers spawned from mid-September to mid-October (Nelson and Bodle 1990; USFWS 2004). The completion of Bonneville Dam in 1938 and the creation of Bonneville Pool inundated portions of the tributary spawning grounds within the Columbia River Gorge, thereby reducing the amount of available spawning habitat (Fulton 1968). There is some belief that tule fall Chinook salmon did not occur in the Klickitat River prior to the completion of Bonneville Dam (Fulton 1968), although

Smith (1966) found that both light-skinned and dark-skinned fall Chinook salmon navigated the Dalles Dam and that the dark-skinned, “local” fall fish (which have an olive drab color and angular form, morphological characteristics suggesting sexual maturity) spawned approximately 1 month earlier than the light-skinned fish and were caught above the dam in the tribal fishery. Currently, natural fall Chinook salmon spawning occurs within tributaries of Bonneville Pool (the backwater to Bonneville Dam) but is probably heavily influenced by hatchery strays (McElhany et al. 2004). Progeny of naturally spawned tule fall Chinook salmon were listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1999 (Good et al. 2005).
Artificial production of tule fall Chinook salmon began at Little White Salmon National Fish Hatchery (NFH) in 1896 and at Spring Creek NFH in 1901 (USFWS 2004; Figure 1). Broodstock for both programs were derived from wild adults captured from the Little White Salmon River and the nearby White Salmon River (USFWS 2007). Both facilities have raised and released variable numbers of tule fall Chinook salmon fry and juveniles since that time (Table A.1 in the appendix). In 2009, annual production at Spring Creek NFH was reduced from a 15.15 × 106 on-station release spread over March, April, and May to 10.55 × 106 juveniles released on-station only over April and May. Broodstock needs have been predominantly met from adult returns to the facility, with a few transfers in recent years (USFWS 2004). At Little White Salmon NFH, tule fall Chinook salmon production ceased in 1985 due to low returns and limited harvest in the sport and commercial fisheries (Nelson and Bodle 1990). An on-station release of tule fall Chinook salmon was again implemented in 2009 and 2010, when 1.75 × 106 tule fall Chinook salmon from Spring Creek NFH were transferred and acclimated for May releases.
Upriver bright fall Chinook salmon historically spawned within the main-stem Columbia River basin east of the Cascade Range, starting at approximately 300 km from the mouth of the Columbia River near the current location of the Dalles Dam (Dauble and Watson 1997), and into both the upper Columbia and Snake rivers. With the exception of late fall–run Chinook salmon in the Lewis and Sandy rivers, there is no information to suggest that this life history form was historically present in the LCR Chinook salmon ESU (Myers et al. 2006). Introduced URB fall Chinook salmon that are naturally spawning in the Columbia River Gorge are not considered part of the LCR Chinook salmon ESU (NMFS 2007).
Artificial production of URB fall Chinook salmon started at Little White Salmon NFH in 1982 with shipments of eggs from Bonneville Fish Hatchery (Stephen Pastor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, personal communication; Table A.1). Egg shipments were received from Bonneville Hatchery from 1982 through 1987 until the Little White Salmon NFH program was able to meet its broodstock needs from adult returns. The original source of this stock was URB fall Chinook salmon trapped in 1977 at Bonneville Dam and the Bonneville Fish Hatchery, and the stock is considered by basin managers as a mid-Columbia

River URB stock (USFWS 2007). The goal for the annual production of URB fall Chinook salmon was changed from a 2.05 × 106 on-station release to 4.55 × 106 in 2009.
The synchronous return of URB and tule fall Chinook salmon to spawn in the White Salmon River below Condit Dam (Figure 1) has brought the genetic integrity of these lineages into question. The numbers of tule and URB fall Chinook salmon escaping to the White Salmon River have been variable over time (Figure 2), and a recent monitoring study documented overlap in the return time of the two lineages to the White Salmon River (Engle et al. 2010). Surveys of the genetic variation in Columbia River Chinook salmon have revealed that extant populations of tule and URB fish cluster into two distinct groups (Waples et al. 2004; Seeb et al. 2007), but samples from the White Salmon River have not been included in these analyses. Since the two lineages are thought to have historically occurred allopatrically, it is unclear whether isolation was based on extrinsic or intrinsic factors. Concerns that the escapement of hatchery URBs into the White Salmon River might lead to genetic introgression among these lineages were raised by the National Marine Fisheries Service during a section 7 consultation on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) artificial propagation programs in the lower and middle Columbia rivers (NMFS 2007) and by the USFWS Hatchery Review Team in their formal evaluation of the URB program at Little White Salmon NFH (USFWS 2007). When springand fall-run populations from the upper Columbia River ESUs were brought into secondary contact in the Snake River, reproductive isolation persisted (Narum et al. 2007); however, the level of divergence between the springand fall-run lineages from the upper Columbia River ESUs is much greater than that between the two fall lineages of interest here (Waples et al. 2004).

Sympatric wild spawning of tule and URB populations in the White Salmon River provides a unique opportunity to investigate introgression among these lineages and thus to determine whether divergence between the two is based on intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors. Here we describe the use of genetic data to address three questions: (1) Are the migrating juveniles from White Salmon River tules, URBs, both tules and URBs, or hybrids? (2) If both tule and URB populations exist in the White Salmon River, how divergent are they? and (3) How similar are juveniles emigrating from the White Salmon River to the tule and URB populations in the two adjacent hatcheries (Spring Creek NFH and Little White Salmon NFH)?
METHODS
Sample Collection
Chinook salmon juveniles were captured by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) personnel using a rotary trap in the lower portion of the White Salmon River in 2006–2008 (Brady Allen, USGS, personal communication). Fin clips were taken from a subset of the captured individuals and stored in 100% ethanol prior to DNA extraction. In 2006, sampling was conducted between March 28 and May 18. Based on the arrival of juveniles on the start date and what appeared to be a genetic population disjunction at the end of the sampling period in 2006 (Figure 3), sampling was broadened to occur from March 7 to June 22 in 2007 and from March 5 to June 26 in 2008. The numbers of individuals sampled in each year are listed in Table 1.
Reference samples, with which the juveniles from the White Salmon River could be compared, included broodstock collections from Spring Creek NFH and Little White Salmon NFH and allopatric populations of tule (Lewis and Cowlitz rivers) and URB (Priest Rapids and Hanford Reach) fall Chinook salmon (Table 1; Figure 1). Genotypes for the reference samples were generated using the methods described below or read from the Genetic Analysis of Pacific Salmon (GAPS) Consortium baseline as indicated in Table 1. The data from these sources were filtered so that only individuals with 10–13 loci genotyped were included (i.e., any individual with 4 or more failed loci was deleted).
Microsatellite Genotyping
DNA was extracted from a small (∼2 mm2) piece of each fin clip using a DNeasy-96 Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify 13 microsatellite loci: Ots3M (Greig and Banks 1999), Ssa408 (Cairney et al. 2000), Ogo4 and Ogo2 (Olsen et al. 1998), Ots9 (Banks et al. 1999), OtsG474 (Williamson et al. 2002), Ots201b, Ots211, Ots212, Ots213, and Ots208b (Greig et al. 2003), Oki100 (K. Miller, Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, unpublished data), and Omm1080 (Rexroad et al. 2001) from each DNA sample. Loci were amplified in 10-μL reaction volumes consisting of 5.0 μL 2× Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix (final concentration, 3 mM MgCl2) and 2.0 μL of extracted DNA. Liquid

handling was performed using a JANUS Automated Workstation (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR products were size-fractionated using an AB3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and raw microsatellite data (electropherograms) were analyzed using GENEMAPPER 4.0. Amplified products were binned into alleles used in the standardized coastwide Chinook salmon baseline (Seeb et al. 2007). All genotypes were scored by two independent readers (double-scoring). Following completion of the data collection, 10% of all samples were reanalyzed in order to estimate genotyping error rates. The Microsoft Excel add-in Microsatellite Toolkit (Park 2001) was used to scan the data set for groups of individuals with identical genotypes.

Assignment Tests
Assignment tests were used to quickly test the hypothesis that Chinook salmon juveniles migrating from the White Salmon River belonged to one of the fall-run lineages. Conditional maximum likelihood was used to estimate mixture proportions (Millar 1987), and genotype probabilities were calculated following the method of Rannala and Mountain (1997) to the estimate probability of each genotype in each population in the GAPS baseline with the program ONCOR (Kalinowski et al. 2007). Individuals with one or more failed loci (<13 loci scored) were assigned based on the loci for which data were available. The probabilities of assignment to reporting groups (the “regional groups” identified by Seeb et al. 2007) were calculated by summing the probabilities over populations.
Hybrid Detection
The model-based approach described by Anderson and Thompson (2002) and Anderson (2009) and implemented in the program NEWHYBRIDS was used to assign each individual to one of the two parental classes (tule or URB) or to one of several hybrid classes (F1 , F2 , or backcross) based on their microsatellite genotypes. This model is similar to other clustering algorithms but also takes into account known patterns of Mendelian inheritance to assign posterior probabilities that each individual in a data set belongs to each potential class. This model does not require fixed allelic differences between parental classes (Anderson and Thompson 2002); however, analysis of
simulated data has been advocated as a means of evaluating assignment accuracy for any given study (Anderson 2009).
To assess the power of the microsatellite data to distinguish between tules, URBs, and their hybrids, we first analyzed four test cases. The first two test cases were based on simulated genotypes and the second two on genotypic data from the tule and URB collections listed in Table 1. The simulated genotypes were generated from the allele frequencies observed in Spring Creek NFH tules (collections 3–5) and Little White Salmon NFH URBs (collections 1–2). The first simulated data set was generated following a model of thorough mixing of the two lineages and consisted of 1,000 each of URBs, tules, F1 s, F2 s, backcross URBs, and backcross tules. The second simulated data set was generated following a model in which the two lineages were largely discreet (but with some hybridization) and consisted of 1,000 URBs and tules but only 100 F1s, 100 F2s, 50 backcross URBs, and 50 backcross tules. The third test case used the observed genotypes from the Spring Creek NFH and Little White Salmon NFH collections (collections 1–5). The fourth test case was based on collections from allopatric populations of URB (collections 6–8) and tule (collections 9–10) fall Chinook salmon.
The data for each of the four test cases were analyzed using NEWHYBRIDS with 105 burn-in sweeps followed by 5 × 105 sweeps. To minimize type I errors (assignment of parental individuals as hybrid), we wished to set posterior probability cutoff levels at a point where at least 99% of parental individuals would be correctly assigned. After such cutoff levels were determined

704 SMITH AND ENGLE
based on the test cases, the juvenile collections from the White Salmon River were analyzed.
Sibling Detection
Estimation of population allele frequencies based on collections of juvenile salmonids may be complicated by the presence of siblings in those collections. To compare the divergence between the URB and tule populations in the White Salmon River with the divergence between these lineages elsewhere, it was thus desirable to identify and remove sets of siblings from our data.
The likelihood method described by Wang (2004) and implemented in the program COLONY was used to identify groups of full siblings in the collections from the White Salmon River. This group-likelihood approach to sibship reconstruction employs a simulated annealing technique to search for the best (maximum likelihood) configuration of siblings within a data set. It also allows incorporation of genotyping error rates to prevent false exclusions of sib groups. COLONY was run six times on data from the juveniles collected in each year (two runs with three replicates each). Full-sib groups that were identified in both runs were denoted as sibships, while groups identified in a single run were denoted as conflicts. To assess our false-positive rate (identification of unrelated individuals as full sibs), we also ran COLONY on 400 simulated unrelated genotypes (200 URBs based on Little White Salmon NFH allele frequencies and 200 tules based on Spring Creek NFH allele frequencies).
Subdivision of the White Salmon River Juvenile Collections
Several of our analyses suggested that our juvenile collections from the White Salmon River contained individuals from two populations (see Results). To evaluate the diversity within these populations and the divergence between them, we needed to separate them. Use of the genetic data to separate the individuals into populations would bias subsequent analyses of diversity and divergence, so we instead split the juvenile collections based on collection date. Juveniles captured between March 5 and May 8 were placed in “early” subcollections, while those captured between May 9 and June 26 were placed in “late” subcollections.
Diversity within collections.—Testing for genotypic ratios that departed from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was conducted using Fisher’s exact tests in GENEPOP version 4.0 (Rousset 2008). The log-likelihood ratio statistic (G-test) was used to test for genotypic disequilibrium (GD) between each pair of loci in each collection. Critical values for both tests were corrected for multiple comparison using standard Bonferroni corrections. For HWE, α = 0.05/13 loci = 0.0038; for GD, α = 0.05/78 pairwise comparisons per population = 0.0006. Allelic richness (the number of alleles observed per collection corrected for unequal numbers of individuals per collection) was calculated for each locus using FSTAT (Goudet 2001). Estimates
of allelic richness were averaged across loci to provide a single estimate for each collection.
To facilitate visual evaluation of the diversity within and among White Salmon River juvenile collections, correspondence analysis was conducted on data from each collection year using the program GENETIX (Belkhir et al. 2004). For comparison, correspondence analysis was also conducted on (1) the collections of tule and URB fall Chinook salmon taken from hatcheries adjacent to the White Salmon River (Spring Creek and Little White Salmon NFHs) and (2) collections of tule and URB fall Chinook salmon that spawn allopatrically (Table 1).
Divergence between collections.—Divergence between all pairs of collections was estimated as FST (θ; Weir and Cockerham 1984). The statistical significance of the FST values was evaluated by comparison with a null distribution based on 1,000 replicate data sets in which individuals were permuted among the pair of collections. Divergence between collections was also assessed using tests of allele frequency heterogeneity as implemented in FSTAT. Although our primary interest was in patterns of divergence, we also evaluated all P-values against a corrected α = 0.05/120 pairwise tests = 4.2 × 10−4, to facilitate review of statistical significance at a tablewide level.
To compare divergence between the tule and URB populations in the White Salmon River and those in Spring Creek and Little White Salmon NFHs, we performed an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA; Excoffier et al. 1992). The proportions of variance among the hatchery and wild populations were compared with those among years within populations. If, for example, the tule population in the White Salmon River is independent of that in Spring Creek NFH, we might expect the variance between those populations to be greater than that among years within the two populations. The statistical significance of variance components was tested by comparison with a null distribution based on 4 × 105 permutations.
RESULTS
Microsatellite Genotyping
Genotypes were obtained for 1,546 juveniles. The 13 microsatellites examined here exhibited 409 alleles, with individual loci exhibiting between 8 and 52 alleles. Comparison of the initial genotypes to those generated for error rate assessment revealed a conflict rate of 7 × 10−3, with large-allele dropout being the cause of most discrepancies.
Assignment Tests
Of the 1,546 White Salmon River juveniles, 23 (∼1.5%) had their highest assignment probabilities to a spring-run group. The remainder had their highest assignment probabilities as either tules (68.0%) or URBs (30.9%).

individuals if we applied a cutoff value of 65%. Based on these results, we decided to use two sets of posterior probability cutoff values for assignment of the White Salmon River juveniles: a stringent cutoff of 0.95 and a relaxed cutoff of 0.65.
Application of the relaxed and stringent cutoff values to the third test case (Spring Creek NFH tules and Little White Salmon NFH URBs) resulted in 2.3% and 15.7% of individuals remaining unassigned (Table 2). Using a relaxed cutoff resulted in a single unexpected assignment (one fish from the 2001 adult collection from Little White Salmon NFH that was assigned as a tule [posterior probability, 0.71]), and using a strict cutoff resulted in no unexpected assignments. No hybrids were detected in either population using either cutoff.
Application of the relaxed and stringent cutoff values to the fourth test case (data from allopatric tule and URB populations) resulted in 4.1% and 39.1% of individuals remaining unassigned (Table 2). Using a relaxed cutoff resulted in five unexpected assignments (two individuals from the Hanford Reach that were assigned as tules [posterior probabilities, 0.719 and 0.921], two individuals from Priest Rapids Hatchery that were assigned as tules [posterior probabilities, 0.731 and 0.868], and one individual from Lewis River that was assigned as a URB [posterior probability, 0.720]). Using a strict cutoff resulted in no unexpected assignments. No hybrids were detected in any of the allopatric populations using either cutoff.
Use of both the relaxed and stringent cutoff values resulted in identification of hybrids in the White Salmon River juvenile collections (Table 2; Figure 3). Under stringent cutoff values, 4.8, 0.8, and 1.0% of the individuals collected in 2006, 2007, and 2008 were hybrids. With relaxed cutoff values, 15.0, 5.0, and 4.3% of the individuals collected in 2006, 2007, and 2008 were hybrids.
The assignment of individuals was consistent among replicate runs using different Markov chain–Monte Carlo starting values: with a posterior probability cutoff of 0.65 assignments were identical among runs, and with a cutoff of 0.95 1 individual

posterior probability than the assignment of simulated hybrids. Further, mean posterior probability decreased as the number of generations since the original hybridization event increased (i.e., F1 > F2 or backcross). Also, hybrids could be assigned to a single “hybrid” class with greater mean posterior probability than they could be assigned to subclasses (results not shown). For this reason, we chose to assign individuals to one of three classes—“tule,” “URB,” or “hybrid”—in evaluating posterior probability cutoff values (i.e., the posterior probabilities of all hybrid classes were summed into a single “hybrid” probability, which was then compared with the probabilities for parental classes and posterior cutoff values). The results of the application of this process to the simulated individuals are shown in Figure 4.
The first test case (simulated data assuming a large proportion of hybrid individuals) suggested that we would need to set the posterior probability cutoff to 95% in order to attain our goal of a type I error (assignment of parental individuals as hybrid) rate no greater than 0.01. The second case (simulated data assuming a smaller proportion of hybrids) suggested that we could achieve our goal of correctly assigning at least 99% of parental

(out of 1,546) was assigned differently between the two runs (as a URB in one run and unassigned in another run).
Sibling Detection
The best (maximum likelihood) sibship configurations suggested that there were between 52 and 107 full sibships among the annual collections from the White Salmon River. Concordance among runs ranged from 91% in 2008 to 92% in 2006 and 2007. Conflicts were generally from sibships involving two individuals. One discrepancy in the 2006 collection involved a trio in which three individuals were identified as siblings in one run and only two of those three were identified as siblings in the other run. Sibships identified in a single run were ignored. For sibships identified in both runs, all individuals but one were removed from the data set. This resulted in the removal of 73, 227, and 152 individuals from the 2006, 2007, and 2008 collections, respectively (Table 1).
Analysis of simulated (unrelated) fish identified three sibships (out of 7.98 × 104 possible pairs) in each of two runs, but none were consistent between runs. Based on the requirement of concordance between runs that was applied to the White Salmon River collections, therefore, zero false positives were detected among simulated individuals.
Diversity within Collections
Departures from HWE were observed for 0–2 loci in each of the reference collections and 0–10 loci in the White Salmon River juvenile collections (Table 1). All departures in the reference collections were associated with positive FIS values (heterozygote deficits), while departures in the juvenile collections were associated with positive FIS values in some cases and negative FIS values (heterozygote excesses) in others. Unrecognized population structure in samples (i.e., the Wahlund effect), the presence of null alleles, the presence of family structure, and genotyping errors may all have contributed to these departures. Genotypic disequilibrium was detected in 0–2 locus pairs in each reference collection and in 0–47 pairs in the White Salmon River juvenile collections. The markers analyzed here have been broadly surveyed in Chinook salmon and generally found to be in genotypic equilibrium. Unrecognized population structure and family structure are probably the causes of the disequilibrium reported here. Removing individuals identified as siblings substantially reduced deviations from the genotype ratios expected under HWE and reduced the numbers of pairs of loci in GD (Table 1).
Allelic richness was generally greater in URB than in tule collections and greater in collections from wild than from hatchery populations within each lineage (Table 1). Allelic richness was greater each year in the late-juvenile component than in the early-juvenile component from White Salmon River. Removal of individuals identified as siblings did not appear to have any broad impact on allelic richness.
Divergence among Collections
Pairwise estimates of FST and tests of allele frequency heterogeneity indicated that most of the populations examined here were statistically divergent from one another. Removal of individuals identified as siblings decreased the numbers of significant divergences between collections; in no case did removing siblings make a comparison significant. When comparing collections with siblings removed to those same collections with siblings included, all FST values and tests for allele frequency heterogeneity were nonsignificant (data not shown).
All comparisons of tule with URB collections yielded statistically significant FST values and allele frequency differences (Table 3). The divergence between early and late juveniles from the White Salmon River (FST, 0.021–0.036) was comparable to that between tule and URB populations that spawn allopatrically (FST, 0.021–0.030) and slightly less than that between collections of the two lineages from the national fish hatcheries (FST, 0.038–0.046). The divergence among collections within each of the two lineages was lower. Among the tule populations sampled, the only nonsignificant comparisons were between Spring Creek NFH and White Salmon River early juveniles (9/9 pairwise FSTs and 6/9 heterogeneity tests). In contrast, nonsignificant FSTs and tests for allele frequency heterogeneity were observed between pairs of collections from all URB populations sampled and between several URB collections and White Salmon River late juveniles (Table 3).
Correspondence analysis of the tule and URB populations that spawn allopatrically resulted in a primary axis (the axis that accounted for the largest proportion of inertia) that appeared to separate individuals from these two lineages (Figure 5). The collections of juveniles from the White Salmon River in 2007 and 2008 also appeared to separate into two clusters along the primary axis, but this pattern was less evident in the collection from 2006 (Figure 6). The percent of inertia explained by the primary axis followed a pattern similar to that revealed by FST: it was largest between the two national fish hatcheries (2.23%), intermediate between the two clusters of juveniles from the White Salmon River (2.03–2.10%), and smallest between the allopatric tule and URB collections (1.54%).
Analysis of molecular variance revealed a greater proportion of variance among temporal collections of White Salmon River early juveniles and Spring Creek NFH tules (0.223; 95% confidence interval, 0.144–0.328) than among the two populations (–0.023; –0.081 to +0.034). Similarly, we observed a greater proportion of variance among temporal collections from White Salmon River late juveniles and Little White Salmon NFH URBs (0.193; 0.099–0.309) than among the two populations (–0.012; –0.141 to +0.064). Divergence among years within sites was thus greater than divergence among sites.

 have been ascending the river for just over 20 years. Prior to the present work it was unknown whether the URBs were successfully reproducing in the White Salmon River and, if they were, whether their effort was resulting in a population of URBs or a tule × URB hybrid swarm. The results presented here revealed that there are two distinct populations of fall Chinook salmon juveniles that migrate from the White Salmon River. The population that leaves from March to early May appears to belong to the tule lineage, and the population that leaves from late May through June appears to belong to the URB lineage. Although there is substantial temporal overlap in the return of tule and URB adults to the White Salmon River and the two lineages spawn in a relatively confined and highly modified habitat, it does not appear that widespread hybridization has resulted. Furthermore, the divergence between the tule and URB populations in the White Salmon River is comparable to that observed between these lineages in parts of the Columbia River where they spawn allopatrically.
Small proportions of hybrids were observed in all juvenile collections from the White Salmon River, the exact proportion in each being dependant on the posterior probability cutoff value applied. Because the divergence between the tule and URB populations in the White Salmon River was comparable to that observed for allopatric populations, we expect that the hybrid class assignment results for simulation 2 (which included 13% hybrids) are probably more relevant to our observed juvenile data than are the results for simulation 1 (which included 66% hybrids). The high type II error rates (assignment of hybrid
individuals as parental) observed in the analysis of simulation 2 (Figure 4) suggest that if the real populations follow this model our estimates of the proportions of juveniles that are hybrids are conservative. Regardless of the cutoff value applied, the proportion of hybrids identified in every collection from the White Salmon River was greater than that identified in every collection not from the river (Table 2).
Hybrid juvenile migration from the White Salmon River did not appear to be limited to any particular collection week. Tules arrive in the river first and presumably spawn first, and our results indicate that they migrate out first. Since tule × URB hybrids could only be formed during the time both populations are spawning, one might hypothesize that hybrid juveniles would primarily be detected in the middle of the out-migration. Our results do not support this hypothesis (Figure 3). However, the proportion of hybrids in most periods is small, so much larger collections of out-migrating juveniles would be required to rigorously test this prediction.
Based on a relaxed posterior probability cutoff for hybrid assignment, the proportion of hybrids among out-migrating juveniles ranged from 4.3% to 15%. Both of these estimates are lower than might be expected if fall Chinook salmon were mating randomly with regard to lineage, which suggests assortative mating and/or presmolt selection against hybrids. A similar result was reported among Chinook salmon lineages in Grays River, a tributary to the lower Columbia River. Microsatellite analysis of juvenile Chinook salmon in that system revealed that a large majority of individuals were of either Rogue River

The authors of that study interpreted their results as being consistent with Utter’s (2001) prediction that displacement (rather that introgression) would be the most likely outcome of the introduction of an outside lineage of anadromous salmonid.
Identification of hybrid individuals in juvenile collections (White Salmon River) but not in adjacent adult collections (three from Spring Creek NFH and one from Little White Salmon NFH) suggests that selection against hybrids also occurs during the migratory life history phase (between the time when the juveniles leave and the mature adults return).

marine distributions that are distinct from the marine distributions of populations originating from other regions (Weitkamp 2009). These distributions exhibit little interannual variation despite substantial variation in ocean conditions, suggesting (1) that there is a strong heritable contribution to marine migratory behavior and (2) that groups encountering unfavorable marine conditions suffer reduced productivity rather than alter their migratory patterns (Weitkamp 2009). Tules and URBs in particular have been shown to exhibit divergent marine distributions shortly after leaving freshwater (Teel 2004). Fishery samples from the Washington coast have shown that these divergent marine distributions persist as the fish mature (Utter et al. 1987). The migratory behavior of tule × URB hybrids is unknown, but our results suggest that such individuals encounter marine environments to which they are not well adapted.
Removal of full siblings from the juvenile collections reduced the temporal divergence among collection years and resulted in tule and URB collections that were more similar to other collections of the corresponding lineages. The process used to remove siblings was conservative, as no effort was made to remove half siblings and full-sibling groups identified in a single run of the model were not eliminated. However, several considerations suggest that the identification and removal of full siblings produced the expected results: (1) analysis of simulated unrelated tule and URB genotypes suggests that the false positive detection rate was very low; (2) the numbers of loci exhibiting departures from HWE and locus pairs exhibiting GD was lower for many juvenile collections after sibling removal (Table 1); (3) the divergence between years for the collections was lower after the removal of full siblings; and (4) after the removal of siblings, the divergence between early-juvenile and adult tule collections was lower, as was that between late-juvenile and adult URB collections. Identification of full sibships was based only on data from juveniles for the year being considered, so results (3) and (4) in particular would be unexpected if sibship identification were inaccurate.
The URB collections analyzed here were less divergent from one another than the tule collections and generally exhibited greater allelic richness. Although the late-juvenile collections from the White Salmon River had some of the highest allelic richness scores, this may reflect the fact that these collections were designated based on a date and probably included individuals from both lineages. Utter et al. (1995) observed a lack of allozyme variation among collections of URB Chinook salmon and interpreted this as connectivity driven by straying throughout the run. Nonsignificant FST values and tests for allele frequency heterogeneity are both useful for deciding whether or not collections represent separate populations (Waples and Gaggiotti 2006). Our results for these two tests suggest that the collections from the Hanford Reach, Priest Rapids Hatchery, and the White Salmon River (2007 and 2008), along with one of the collections from Little White Salmon NFH (2001), could have been drawn from a single genetic population. At a minimum, these results suggest a high rate of gene flow among the popula-
tions from which the collections were taken. Hatchery programs propagating URB fall Chinook salmon have probably played a role in the lack of divergence among URB populations (Utter et al. 1995). A very large part of the URB natural production occurs in a single main-stem Columbia River area (the Hanford Reach) and fish from that region were used to found the Priest Rapids stock and subsequently the Bonneville Hatchery stock, the Little White Salmon NFH stock, and others. Further, transfers of URB fall Chinook salmon among hatcheries are common. The threshold at which populations can respond to natural selection and adapt to local environments is inversely related to the rate at which they receive migrants. If the rate of straying has been substantially increased due to hatchery practices, we might expect a reduction in genetic variance in the URB population as well as in its ability to respond to changes in the environment.
The divergence between earlyand late-migrating juveniles from the White Salmon River was comparable to that between other tule and URB populations. Even though the early component contained a few individuals that assigned as URBs and the late component contained a few individuals that assigned as tules, the divergence between the collections was still greater than that among some allopatric collections of tule and URB Chinook salmon (Table 3). The similarities between White Salmon River and Spring Creek NFH tules and between White Salmon River and Little White Salmon NFH URBs probably reflect a mixture of common ancestry and contemporary gene flow between wild and hatchery populations. Greater divergence among annual collections than among collection sites, as indicated by the AMOVA, further underscored the strong similarity between the two populations in the White Salmon River and the populations in Spring Creek NFH and Little White Salmon NFH.
The results presented here suggest a role for intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors in the divergence between tule and URB Chinook salmon. Biological differences between these two lineages were recognized in their placement in different ESUs (Myers et al. 1998). While tules and URBs typically appear as sister taxa in analyses of neutral genetic markers (e.g., Waples et al. 2004; Seeb et al. 2007), such results may be poor predictors of the potential for introgression (Utter 2001). The sympatric populations of tule and URB Chinook salmon in the White Salmon River apparently produce a small proportion of hybrid juveniles, but we observed (1) no hybrid individuals among the adult returns and (2) divergence among the two populations in the White Salmon River comparable to that between allopatric populations of these two lineages. It is very likely that a low level of gene flow occurs between these lineages; however, our results provide no evidence that such gene flow is more common in the White Salmon River than elsewhere.
The assignment of one individual from the Little White Salmon NFH broodstock as a tule potentially represents an assignment error, but it may also reflect variability in timing and maturity at return for the tule lineage. Adult ladder

operation studies at Spring Creek NFH and Little White Salmon NFH have documented tagged fall Chinook salmon (both tules and URBs) moving between the entrances to each of these facilities and the White Salmon River (Engle et al. 2006a, 2006b). Although potential broodfish are screened rigorously at both hatcheries, the large numbers of fish handled and the phenotypic plasticity in both lineages probably result in some level of interlineage hybridization in these hatcheries. Adult fall Chinook salmon are designated as tules or URBs based on morphology when they pass Bonneville Dam. Jepson et al. (2010) documented that a small proportion (<2%) of these fish were assigned to the wrong lineage, however. Both of these findings suggest that some interlineage hybridization occurs within hatcheries. In any case, we found no evidence that unintentional lineage crossing at hatcheries has led to returning adult hybrids. We expect that selective forces acting on hybrid juveniles leaving the White Salmon River would also act on hybrids released from hatcheries.
Gene flow from the URB population in Little White Salmon NFH to the tule population in the White Salmon River may pose less of a genetic risk than gene flow from that stock into other URB populations. McIsaac and Quinn (1988) identified a genetic component to the homing behavior of URB Chinook salmon, observing that 9% of URBs released near Bonneville Dam returned as adults to upstream areas to spawn with other URBs (despite their never having been directly exposed to those sites). Large-scale integration of hatchery fish into a wild population can have deleterious consequences, including reduced fitness of the wild stock and its loss of ability to respond to environmental change (Utter 2001). Moreover, it is possible that nongenetic risks have greater potential impact than either of these genetic risks. For example, demographic risks (e.g., incidental harvest) and ecological risks (e.g., the superimposition of redds and competition for prey) posed by the URB program at Little White Salmon NFH were identified in a recent review (USFWS 2007). Additional information will be required to assess the magnitude of the demographic and ecological impacts of URB culture on native populations of Chinook salmon.

Appendix: Hatchery Release
TABLE A.1. Fall Chinook salmon egg collections, fry releases, and juvenile releases of both tule and URB stocks at Spring Creek and Little White Salmon national fish hatcheries and Big White Salmon Ponds, a satellite facility of Spring Creek NFH. Data are in hundreds of thousands and are summarized from Nelson and Bodle (1990), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2004), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Columbia River Information System (S. Pastor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, personal communication). Fry releases are from historical records and are noted when specifically identified as such; in some cases size information was not available. Parr, juvenile, and smolt releases are grouped and indicate some level of husbandry beyond the fry stage for several weeks, months, or (in some brood years) a year. Egg transfers from outside sources are not included in the number of eggs collected but parr, smolt, and juvenile releases in some years contain transfers of juveniles not collected in the three locations identified.
