Wide variation in spatial genetic structure between natural 
populations of the European beech (Fagus sylvatica) 
and its implications for SGS comparability 
AS Jump1,2, L Rico2, M Coll2 and J Pen˜uelas2 
Identification and quantification of spatial genetic structure (SGS) within populations remains a central element of 
understanding population structure at the local scale. Understanding such structure can inform on aspects of the species’ 
biology, such as establishment patterns and gene dispersal distance, in addition to sampling design for genetic resource 
management and conservation. However, recent work has identified that variation in factors such as sampling methodology, 
population characteristics and marker system can all lead to significant variation in SGS estimates. Consequently, the extent to 
which estimates of SGS can be relied on to inform on the biology of a species or differentiate between experimental treatments 
is open to doubt. Following on from a recent report of unusually extensive SGS when assessed using amplified fragment length 
polymorphisms in the tree Fagus sylvatica, we explored whether this marker system led to similarly high estimates of SGS extent 
in other apparently similar populations of this species. In the three populations assessed, SGS extent was even stronger than 
this previously reported maximum, extending up to 360 m, an increase in up to 800% in comparison with the generally 
accepted maximum of 30–40m based on the literature. Within this species, wide variation in SGS estimates exists, whether 
quantified as SGS intensity, extent or the Sp parameter. Consequently, we argue that greater standardization should be applied 
in sample design and SGS estimation and highlight five steps that can be taken to maximize the comparability between SGS 
estimates.

INTRODUCTION 
The identification and description of patterns in the distribution of 
biodiversity is key to understanding species–environment relationships 
across multiple spatial and temporal scales (Legendre, 1993; 
de Knegt et al., 2010). Such information can further our understanding 
of species from their biology to community ecology and 
broad-scale biogeography (Legendre, 1993). Within communities, 
resource distribution, interspecific interactions, dispersal limitation 
and disturbance can all lead to the non-random distribution of 
individuals (Legendre, 1993; de Knegt et al., 2010). Within populations, 
non-random distribution of individual genotypes can also 
occur. In plants, such spatial genetic structure (SGS) is commonly 
believed to result from restricted pollen and seed dispersal leading to 
deviation from random mating and offspring being more likely to 
establish close to the parent plants. Consequently, since it results from 
breeding and dispersal syndromes, SGS is expected to be comparable 
between groups of species sharing similar traits (Vekemans and Hardy, 
2004). 
Determination of SGS within natural populations is important 
because it can allow us to estimate the extent of gene dispersal within 
populations (Rousset 2000; Vekemans and Hardy, 2004) and, therefore, 
to indirectly quantify the dispersal distance of the species 
(Oddou-Muratorio et al., 2010) and predict the implications for 
local breeding and evolution (Smouse and Peakall, 1999). Furthermore, 
such fine-scale characterization of the genetic structure of 
populations can inform appropriate strategies for stand management 
and conservation, including in-situ and ex-situ conservation of genetic 
resources and collection strategies for genetic resource harvesting 
(Gapare and Aitken, 2005). Conversely, overlooking such structure 
in reserve design or resource collection might lead to over-representing 
some genotypes whilst under-representing population genetic 
diversity in collected material (Gapare and Aitken, 2005). 
Given the significance of determining SGS for both theoretical 
aspects of population genetics and evolution and their application in 
species conservation and management, it is important to understand 
how SGS relates to the biology of the species and the degree of inter 
and intraspecific variation in this parameter. Previous meta-analysis 
has shown a significant relationship between SGS and plant life form, 
breeding system and population density (Vekemans and Hardy, 2004). 
In tree species with restricted seed and pollen dispersal, low gene flow 
is expected to result in significant genetic differentiation within 
continuous populations (Cavers et al., 2005; Hardy et al., 2006), 
whereas high gene flow within populations of wind-pollinated species 
is expected to result in them demonstrating relatively low levels of 
SGS (Leonardi and Menozzi, 1996; Streiff et al., 1998). Indeed, 
in wind-pollinated forest tree species such as the common ash,

Fraxinus excelsior (Heuertz et al., 2003), the oaks Quercus petraea and 
Quercus robur (Bacilieri et al., 1994; Streiff et al., 1998), and the 
beeches Fagus sylvatica and Fagus crenata (Merzeau et al., 1994; 
Leonardi and Menozzi, 1996; Takahashi et al., 2000; Asuka et al., 
2004; Vornam et al., 2004; Scalfi et al., 2005; Chybicki et al., 2009), 
significant SGS is rarely detectable beyond approximately 30–40m. 
However, recent work has demonstrated that SGS can show marked 
variation within a single species because of variation in the density of 
individuals within the population or their life stage. For example, 
Vekemans and Hardy (2004) found higher SGS in low-density 
populations based on an analysis of 47 plant species differing in 
their life form and ecology. SGS is not expected to remain constant 
over time, instead declining in intensity and/or extent as trees age and 
the population thins (Chung et al., 2003; Hardesty et al., 2005; 
Vaughan et al., 2007), although some studies also report contrasting 
results (for example, Oddou-Muratorio et al., 2010). Tree density and 
age class may also interact. In the study by Jolivet et al. (2011) on the 
wild cherry, Prunus avium, SGS was found to be more intense in 
saplings than adult trees, but only in low-density populations. 
Furthermore, SGS has been shown to vary across the geographical 
range of a species with SGS being absent in populations that are part 
of continuous forest distribution in the core region of the geographical 
distribution of Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis despite being relatively 
strong elsewhere (Gapare and Aitken, 2005). This geographical impact 
on SGS was interpreted as resulting from higher density of core 
populations reducing SGS, in agreement with the meta-analysis 
performed by Vekemans and Hardy (2004) referred to above. 
The studies cited above demonstrate that variation in SGS within 
species can be substantial. Furthermore, such variation can be exacerbated 
by comparing across different molecular marker types, because 
the number of markers and degree of polymorphism of individual 
markers can also influence the results (Cavers et al., 2005; Jump and 
Pen˜uelas, 2007; Jolivet et al., 2011). Consequently, single estimates 
of SGS are unlikely to be reliable to accurately represent SGS 
for individual species. This potentially high variation becomes a 
problem, because many studies assume that SGS is a species-level 
trait. Consequently, the implications of SGS variability for the quantification 
of dispersal, distribution of diversity within populations or 
other aspects of the species biology risk being overlooked. Work 
that has explored variation in SGS across species has been 
highly valuable in allowing us to understand the trait relationships 
behind such variation (Vekemans and Hardy 2004; Hardy et al., 2006), 
however, within such studies, species generally remain represented by 
single values. 
An example of wide variation in SGS within a single species comes 
from work on P. sitchensis, where the extent of SGS based on sequence 
tagged site molecular markers was significantly40 for up to 500m in 
some populations and yet remained effectively 0 in others (Gapare and 
Aitken, 2005). In F. sylvatica, initial work using allozyme and microsatellite 
markers revealed SGS to be approximately 30–40m. (Merzeau 
et al., 1994; Leonardi and Menozzi, 1996; Vornam et al., 2004; Scalfi 
et al., 2005), while subsequent work identified that SGS extended to 
up to approximately 110m when assessments were based on amplified 
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers (Jump and Pen˜uelas, 
2007). 
Given the potential for wide variation in SGS within single species 
indicated by different studies and marker types, we first sought to 
determine if the application of AFLP in F. sylvatica leads to consistently 
high SGS estimates in this species. Subsequently, we aimed to 
quantify the variation in maximum extent of SGS reported for this 
species and recommend practical steps to increase the standardization 
of SGS estimation and maximize the comparability of this parameter 
between studies. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study species 
F. sylvatica (European beech) is a monoecious, diploid, late-successional tree 
that dominates temperate forests over ca 17 million ha of Europe. It is highly 
outcrossing and largely self-incompatible with irregular synchronous flowering 
(masting) events. Reproduction does not begin until the species is 40–50 years 
old (Wagner et al., 2010). Seed is primarily gravity dispersed with average seed 
dispersal estimated to be o25m (Gregorius and Kownatzki, 2005), although 
rare long distance seed dispersal can occur over distances as much as 3 km, 
effected primarily by the European jay (Garrulus glandarius) (Nilsson, 1985; 
Kunstler et al., 2007). Pollen dispersal generally occurs over distances up to 
250m, with the vast majority of pollen deposition estimated to occur within 
1800m (Poska and Pidek, 2010; Wagner et al., 2010). 
Sites and sampling 
This work was conducted in the Catalan Pyrenees in north-east Spain. The 
F. sylvatica forest is naturally occurring uneven-aged high forest where this 
species is monodominant with a relatively even distribution of individual trees. 
Populations were sampled in three valleys, Bergueda`, Ripolle`s and Vall d’Aran. 
Further details of these populations are given in Table 1. 
We sampled 150 young trees (o ca 80 years old) from each population in 
forest with no evidence of any recent disturbance. Trees were sampled from the 
largest expanse of continuous forest during spring 2009 and the location of 
each tree was mapped. Samples were collected at random along a series of 
transects (following SGS sampling recommendations of Zeng et al., 2010) from 
trees covering the full altitudinal distribution of the species in each location 
(Figure 1). Leaf material collected from each tree was dried immediately in finegrain 
silica gel.

DNA extraction and purification 
Approximately 0.5 cm2 leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen for 30 s 
at 30 revolutions per second using a mixer mill (Tissue Lyser, Qiagen Inc., 
Valencia, CA, USA) and two glass beads. Genomic DNA was extracted 
from ground tissue using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified 
using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer running software v3.0.1 
(NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. 
AFLP analysis 
AFLP molecular markers were used for this study owing to their high utility for 
investigating SGS (Cavers et al., 2005; Jump and Pen˜uelas, 2007). AFLP analysis 
followed a modified version of the original protocol published by Vos et al. 
(1995) as detailed below. 
Restriction digests and ligation of adapters 
DNA (0.3 mg) was digested at 65 1C for 1 h with 5 units TrueI (Roche Applied 
Science, Basel, Switzerland) and 50 ng ml–1 bovine serum albumin in 35 ml of the 
manufacturer’s buffer (composition confidential). Then 7.5 units of EcoRI 
(Roche Applied Science) were added and incubation continued at 37 1C for 2h. 
PCR adapters were ligated to the cut fragments by adding to the restriction 
digest 5 ml of the manufacturer’s buffer (composition confidential), 25 pmol 
EcoRI adapter, 50pmol MseI adapter and 1 unit T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied 
Science). Ligation was allowed to proceed for 3 h at 37 1C and then overnight at 
4 1C. The mix was then diluted 5 with sterile H2O. Oligonucleotide sequences 
for PCR adapters and primers are those used in the original protocol. 
PCR preamplification 
In all, 5 ml of the diluted ligation mix was used as the template for the 
preamplification. PCR was performed with 30 ng Eco-A and 30 ng of Mse-C 
primers with 0.2 units Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied 
Science) and 0.2mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP with 2.5mM MgCl2 in a 
total of 20 ml of the manufacturer’s buffer (composition confidential). The PCR 
programme consisted of 28 cycles of (94 1C for 30 s, 56 1C for 60 s, 72 1C for 
60 s). PCR products were diluted 10 with sterile H2O. 
Selective AFLP amplification 
Six Eco-ANN/Mse-CNN primer combinations were tested for the selective 
amplification (where N represents any nucleotide). Eco-ANN primer extensions 
were: AAG and ACC. Mse-CNN primer extensions were: CTC, CAG and CAC. 
Combinations selected for the final genotyping on the grounds of giving the 
greatest number of polymorphic bands and most easily scored banding profile 
were, Eco-AAG+Mse-CTC and Eco-ACC+Mse-CAC. The Eco-ANN primer 
carried a VIC fluorochrome (Applied Biosystems—ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). 
In total, 2.5 ml of the diluted PCR products was used as the template for the 
selective amplification. PCR was performed using 5 ng Eco-ACG primer and 
25 ng Mse-CNN primer with 0.16 units Expand High Fidelity PCR System 
and 0.2mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP with 2mM MgCl2 in a total of 10 ml 
of the manufacturer’s buffer. The PCR programme consisted 36 cycles in total: 
13 cycles of (94 1C for 30 s, t 1C for 30 s, 72 1C for 60 s, where t drops from 65 to 
56 in 0.7 1C steps), followed by 23 cycles of (94 1C for 30 s, 56 1C for 30 s, 72 1C 
for 60 s). 
For analysis of the selective AFLP-PCR products, 2 ml of PCR product was 
mixed with 12 ml Hi-Di Formamide (ABI) 0.4 ml Liz-600 size standard (ABI). 
Samples were denatured at 94 1C for 3min and electrophoresis performed 
using an ABI3130xl genetic analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Fragment sizes were determined with reference to the size standard using 
GeneMarker v 1.85 (Softgenetics LLC, State College, PA, USA). Fragment 
presence or absence was scored by hand and subsequently checked by a second 
investigator without reference to sample ID. A binary matrix of band presence/ 
absence was then created. Each set of 96 reactions included 2 positive (known 
genotype duplicates) and 2 negative (H2O or PCR mix without DNA) controls 
carried from restriction digest through to selective AFLP-PCR. Individuals that 
repeatedly failed to amplify or showed poor amplification were eliminated from 
the data set. Any band occurring in a sample was excluded from the analysis if it

also occurred in a negative control. Only those markers with a maximum allele 
frequency of 95% or less were included in the final SGS analyses. 
Statistical analysis 
Population genetic analysis. Population genetic analyses were conducted using 
AFLP-SURV v 1.0 (Vekemans et al., 2002) with allele frequencies estimated 
using the Bayesian method with non-uniform prior distribution and Fis of 
0.088 (as calculated for a nearby population of this species by Jump and 
Pen˜uelas (2007)). Genetic diversity was estimated as expected heterozygosity 
and genetic divergence between the three populations was estimated by Fst. 
Spatial genetic structure. Analyses of SGS were conducted based on the 
calculation of the kinship coefficient between individuals (Fij), which summarizes 
the genetic co-ancestry between individuals i and j and can be defined 
as Fij¼(Qij–Qm)/(1–Qm) (where Qij is the probability of identity in state for 
random genes from i and j, and Qm is the average probability of identity in state 
for genes coming from random individuals from the sample). Kinship 
coefficients were calculated from AFLP data according to the dominant marker 
estimator described by Hardy (2003). For estimation of kinship coefficients, the 
inbreeding coefficient (Fis) was set to 0.088, however, Hardy (2003) notes that 
estimation of kinship using this method is relatively robust to errors in Fis 
estimation. 
The mean estimate of Fij over pairs of individuals within a given distance 
interval (F(d)) was computed based on 20 equal intervals rising by 20m from 0 
to 400m and plotted against distance to visualize spatial autocorrelation 
patterns. In all, 95% confidence intervals for F(d) were calculated based on 
10 000 random permutations of individuals among geographical locations. To 
test the hypothesis that there was significant spatial structure, the observed 
regression slope of Fij on ln(rij), b, was compared with those obtained after 
10 000 random permutations of individuals among locations and statistical 
significance determined using a Mantel test, (where ln(rij) represents the 
natural logarithm of the physical distance between individuals i and j). This 
procedure has the advantage that all of the information is contained in a single 
test statistic and the results are not dependent on arbitrarily set distance 
intervals (Vekemans and Hardy, 2004). SGS was also quantified by the Sp 
statistic, which represents the rate of decrease in pairwise kinship with distance 
(Vekemans and Hardy, 2004). Sp is calculated as –b/(1–F(1)) (where F(1) is the 
mean Fij between individuals in the first distance class). Following Hardy et al. 
(2006), we present the standard error (s.e.) of b (calculated by jackknifing 
over loci) as an estimate of the variability of Sp. This estimate does not take into 
account the s.e. of F(1), because its impact on the SE of Sp is very small in 
comparison with that of b (OJ Hardy, personal communication). All analyses of 
SGS were conducted using the program SPAGeDi V1.2d (Hardy and Vekemans, 
2002). 
In order to compare the data for the three populations sampled here with 
the previous results found for the nearby Montseny population by Jump and 
Pen˜uelas (2007), we randomly excluded loci and individuals from the data set 
of Jump and Pen˜uelas (2007) to give a population size of 150 individuals 
genotyped at 193 AFLP loci. The Montseny population was then subject 
to the same data analysis to that described above for the three Pyrenean 
populations. 
RESULTS 
Population genetic analyses 
A total of 317 AFLP polymorphic markers (allele frequency o1) were 
scored over 414 individuals from the Ripolle`s, Bergueda` and Vall 
d’Aran populations. The number of markers scored per primer 
combination was 155 for Eco-AAG/Mse-CTC and 162 for Eco-ACC/ 
Mse-CAC. In all, 193 markers polymorphic at the 95% criterion and 
with an error rate of 5.3% (Pompanon et al., 2005) were used for 
subsequent analyses. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.173 for 
the Bergueda` population to 0.189 for Vall d’Aran (Table 1). Fst 
calculated between all three populations was 0.115. 
Spatial genetic structure 
Significant SGS was detected over all individuals sampled within each 
study population (Po0.001, Figure 2). The mean number of pairwise 
comparisons per distance class was 79 (24–101) for Ripolle`s, 83 (45– 
103) for Bergueda` and 91 (59–127) for Vall d’Aran (means are 
followed by the range in parentheses). The mean sample size per 
distance class for the reanalyzed Montseny data was 75 (60–95). 
The lowest maximum intensity of SGS (F(max), 0.062 based on the 
reanalyzed Montseny data) was 36% of the value found for the 
population with the highest maximum intensity (0.173, Bergueda`; 
Table 1; Figure 2). In the Ripolle`s and Montseny populations, this 
maximum was reached in the first distance class (F(1), 0–20m) 
whereas in the Bergueda` and Vall d’Aran populations maximum 
SGS intensity was recorded in the second distance class (F(2), 
20–40m; Figure 2). For all populations, the mean kinship coefficient 
per distance class, F(d), declines with increasing distance. However, 
the extent of SGS also varies between populations with the minimum 
estimate (SGSmin, the point at which F(d) first becomes statistically 
indistinguishable from 0 at P¼0.05) varying from 200m in the 
Vall d’Aran population to 80m (40% of the Vall d’Aran value) 
at Montseny (Table 1). The maximum estimate of SGS extent 
(SGSmax, the greatest distance at which F(d)40 at P¼0.05 before 
F(d) crosses the x axis) in the population with the lowest value 
for this SGS parameter (Montseny, 180 m) is 50% of the highest 
value of this parameter (360 m, Bergueda`). Values of Sp calculated 
from our full data sets varied from 0.0054 for Montseny to 0.0222 at 
Bergueda`, with the minimum value being only 24% of the maximum 
reported value.

confidence limit. Patterns of SGS in all species differ significantly from a random distribution of individuals at Po0.001 based on the regression slope of 
individual pairwise kinship coefficients on the corresponding logarithmic geographical distance between individuals (see text). Sp represents the rate of 
decrease in pairwise kinship with distance. The Montseny analysis is based on data from Jump and Pen˜uelas (2007).

DISCUSSION 
The populations that we investigated show pronounced variation in 
the intensity and extent of their SGS. Of the populations newly 
investigated here, Bergueda` shows the greatest intensity of SGS and 
extent of SGSmax as well as the highest value of Sp whereas the Vall 
d’Aran population shows the greatest extent of SGSmin. Tree density 
varies little between the populations studied, with the least-dense 
population (Ripolle`s) having a density some 80% that of the mostdense 
(Bergueda`) based on data taken from forest inventory records 
(Table 1). Here, SGS is generally lowest in the lowest density population 
with a 25% increase in tree density being associated with an 
increase in SGS of 38% (when quantified by SGSmax) – 120% (when 
quantified by Sp) when minimum and maximum values are compared 
for each parameter. When we include the reanalyzed data for the 
Montseny population in these comparisons, an increase in tree density 
of 27% is associated with an increase in SGS of 100% (SGSmax) – 
340% (Sp). Although the data sets for the Montseny population and 
the other populations reported here are partially different, the Eco- 
AAG + Mse-CTC primer combination is common to both data sets. 
Furthermore, the subsampling study conducted by Jump and Pen˜uelas 
(2007) indicates that, given the large number of markers used, the 
difference in identity of the individual AFLP loci is likely to have very 
little impact on the correlograms produced. 
Our results clearly show that pronounced variation in SGS 
exists between the apparently similar F. sylvatica populations included 
in this study. However, the most striking implications of these results 
arise when these new quantifications of SGS in F. sylvatica are 
compared with previous estimates for this and other wind-pollinated 
tree species. The consensus from the literature is that SGS in such 
species is weak. For example, the extent of SGS is generally accepted to 
be limited to 30–40m in F. sylvatica (Merzeau et al., 1994; Leonardi 
and Menozzi, 1996; Vornam et al., 2004; Oddou-Muratorio et al., 
2010), and Q. petraea (Bacilieri et al., 1994; Streiff et al., 1998) and up 
to 60m in Q. robur (Bacilieri et al., 1994; Streiff et al., 1998; 
Hampe et al., 2010) and Fraxinus excelsior (Heuertz et al., 2003). The 
values given in this study represent an increase in detected SGS extent 
for F. sylvatica of 567–800% depending on whether maximum values 
for SGSmin or SGSmax are compared. Variation in other SGS parameters 
is not so extreme, with F(max) increasing by 111% in comparison with 
values presented by Oddou-Muratorio et al. (2010), while the maximum 
value of Sp reported by Oddou-Muratorio et al. (2010) (0.0354) 
is 61% higher than the maximum value that we report here. 
Given this wide variation in SGS reported from within a single 
species, clear issues arise related to the reporting, comparison and 
application of SGS estimates. The much lower values for SGS extent 
reported above for wind-pollinated trees (30–40m for F. sylvatica and 
Q. petraea, 60m for Q. robur and F. excelsior) were all derived using 
SSR markers, whereas the much more extensive SGS (up to 360m) 
reported here was assessed using AFLP. Given this order of magnitude 
difference between estimates, the comparability of SGS estimates from 
different markers seems doubtful. Although it might be argued that 
the new estimates of SGS presented here are high because of unusually 
strong SGS rather than an effect of the marker system, a previous 
study in F. sylvatica demonstrated that even assessing the same 
individuals with different markers lead to SGS extent that was 
267% higher when assessed using AFLP as opposed to SSR markers 
(Jump and Pen˜uelas, 2007). Studies comparing estimates of population 
differentiation based on AFLP and SSR markers often report 
higher divergence when calculated based on AFLP data (Mariette 
et al., 2002; Gaudeul et al., 2004; Hollingsworth and Ennos, 2004; 
Woodhead et al., 2005). Higher differentiation might be detected with 
AFLP markers if they are localized within the chloroplast or mitochondrial 
genome, and because there is a greater likelihood that some 
AFLPs will be linked to adaptive traits (Maguire et al., 2002; Mariette 
et al., 2002; Gaudeul et al., 2004). However, neither explanation 
sufficiently explains the large differences in SGS identified using 
these markers, which might be better explained by the greater genome 
coverage of the more numerous AFLP markers and the greater 
polymorphism of the individual SSR Loci (Hollingsworth and 
Ennos, 2004; Woodhead et al., 2005; Jump and Pen˜uelas, 2007; 
Skrede et al., 2009). 
Sp represents an integrated estimate of both SGS intensity and 
extent and is believed to be the most readily comparable estimate of 
SGS between sites and species (Vekemans and Hardy, 2004). However, 
recent work demonstrates that Sp can also vary by an order of 
magnitude within the same species, for example, from a lower 
estimate of 0.0037 (Jump and Pen˜uelas, 2007) to 0.0354 (Oddou- 
Muratorio et al., 2010), both based on SSR data in F. sylvatica. The 
extent of reported variation of Sp within F. sylvatica is, therefore, 2.6 
times greater than the variation across five wind-pollinated tree species 
(0.0020–0.0108) listed by Vekemans and Hardy (2004) and 12% of the 
total variation in Sp shown across all 47 species with diverse reproductive 
and dispersal ecology included in this meta-analysis. Such 
wide variation in Sp may be due, in part, to the observation that, if the 
relationship between F(d) and ln(r) departs strongly from linearity, 
estimates of Sp can also vary within a population depending on the 
maximum distance sampled (Vekemans and Hardy, 2004). The 
linearity of this relationship is rarely tested in studies reporting Sp. 
However, recent work demonstrates that not accounting for such 
deviation can lead to estimates of Sp varying by up to 280% within a 
single population (Jump and Pen˜uelas, 2007). 
Despite using the same molecular markers and a broadly equivalent 
sampling regime SGS varied by 38–120% between the populations 
newly sampled for this study implying that, in many cases, 
differences reported between species could fall within the amount of 
variability expected between conspecific populations. Given that 
SGS within a species will be impacted by a wide range of factors that 
affect the distribution of individuals, their establishment success and 
longevity (Chung et al., 2003; Oddou-Muratorio et al., 2004; Gapare 
and Aitken, 2005; Hardesty et al., 2005; Vaughan et al., 2007; Hampe 
et al., 2010), it is unsurprising that intraspecific variation in SGS 
occurs. However, such wide variation within a single species highlights 
the dangers of characterizing SGS at the species level based on very few 
values and, in some cases, only a single estimate. Consequently, we 
caution against the uncritical comparison of SGS between studies, 
whether as SGS extent, intensity, or Sp and argue that in order to 
compare SGS between studies, a much greater degree of standardization 
in reporting is necessary.With this aim, we outline five points that 
should be taken in order to maximize the SGS comparability: 
(1) Compare SGS estimates only within marker types and for similar 
marker numbers—thereby removing the variation associated 
with non-comparability of estimates based on different classes 
of markers and maximizing comparability within markers. 
(2) Calculate Sp only over distances up to the maximum distance for 
which the relationship between F(d) and ln(r) is demonstrably 
linear—thereby removing methodologically based variation 
because of non-comparability in Sp calculation. 
(3) When comparing between sites or treatments, the sampling 
of individuals should be standardized in order to maximize 
comparability, such as in the recent study of Q. robur by Hampe 
et al. (2010).

(4) When quantifying SGS or comparing different estimates, ensure 
that the number of markers and individuals used to derive 
estimates of SGS are sufficient to detect SGS where it exists (for 
example, using the subsampling approach of Cavers et al. (2005). 
Thereby avoiding the potential of falsely rejecting the occurrence 
of SGS in one or more populations because of a lack of statistical 
power, rather than a real absence of SGS. The use of a suboptimal 
sampling design might still give informative comparisons 
within studies, assuming that other aspects of sampling 
design are held constant, although it is likely to limit cross-study 
comparability. 
(5) When using SGS estimates to describe ecological characteristics 
at the species level (for example, the extent of gene flow, 
neighborhoods for collection of genetic material), give the 
mean and associated variation and the number of single population 
estimates from which the mean is derived. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Three superficially similar populations of F. sylvatica investigated for 
SGS for this study show SGS variation of up to 120%, despite similar 
tree density. These new estimates of SGS result in an increase in the 
generally accepted maximum extent of SGS by up to 800% in this 
species, with individuals being more genetically similar than would be 
expected by chance up to 360m from each individual tree. In 
conjunction with estimates from earlier studies, it is clear that wide 
variation in SGS estimates exist whether quantified as SGS intensity, 
extent, or the Sp parameter. Furthermore, SGS estimates appear to 
show low comparability between AFLP and other marker types with 
much greater SGS extent observed using AFLP markers. Consequently, 
much greater caution should be applied when comparing SGS 
estimates between studies within or between species and greater 
standardization should be applied in sample design and SGS estimation 
and reporting. Such caution is particularly important when 
applying SGS estimates to inform on the biology of a species for 
conservation or management purposes, such as the estimation of gene 
flow within species or in sampling design for the collection or 
conservation of genetic resources.
