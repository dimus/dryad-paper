How natural selection might be involved in speciation remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. When two or more species co-occur in the same areas, natural selection may favor divergence in mating traits. By acting in sympatric but not allopatric populations, natural selection can also affect mate choice within species and ultimately initiate speciation among conspecific populations. Here, we address this potential effect in the sea rock-pool beetles Ochthebius quadricollis and O. urbanelliae. The two species, which inhabit the Mediterranean coasts, co-occurr syntopically in an area along the Italian Tyrrhenian coast and completed reproductive isolation by reinforcement. In this article, through mating trials under laboratory conditions between conspecific populations, we found in O. quadricollis no deviations from random mating. Conversely, in O. urbanelliae, we found a clear pattern of premating isolation between the reinforced populations sympatric with O. quadricollis and those nonreinforced allopatric. This pattern is consistent with the view that natural selection, which completed the reproductive isolation between the two species in sympatry, led incidentally also to partial premating reproductive isolation (IPSI estimator from 0.683 to 0.792) between conspecific populations of O. urbanelliae. This case study supports an until recently underappreciated role of natural selection resulting from species interactions in initiating speciation.

The way in which natural selection might be involved in speciation remains one of the most hotly debated questions in evolutionary biology, with the questions of how natural selection can be involved in initiating speciation of particular interest (Coyne and Orr 2004; Weissing et al. 2011 for a review). Because speciation involves the evolution of reproductive isolation between diverging populations (Coyne and Orr 2004), investigating how natural
selection initiates reproductive isolation is central to understanding its role in the early stages of speciation. One way in which natural selection acts directly in speciation is through the process known as reinforcement. In this process, natural selection leads to divergence in mating traits by acting against maladaptive hybridization between two divergent and potentially interbreeding taxa that co-occur in sympatry (Coyne and Orr 2004).

         During reinforcement, natural selection and sexual selection may interact, given that natural selection acts on female preference, which drives the evolution of divergence in male reproductive signals (Servedio and Noor 2003; Coyne and Orr 2004; Ritchie 2007). The interplay between the two selective forces, in sympatric but not allopatric populations, may therefore lead to a pattern of geographic divergence in mating traits between conspecific populations (Ortiz-Barrientos et al. 2009 and references therein).
Howard in 1993 suggested that during reinforcement, divergence in mate recognition systems in sympatric populations not only may complete the reproductive isolation between heterospecifics, but may also lead incidentally to premating reproductive isolation between conspecific sympatric and allopatric populations (Howard 1993). This idea was developed further and empirically demonstrated in the following years (Lemmon 2009; Ortiz-Barrientos et al. 2009; Pfennig and Pfennig 2009; Hoskin and Higgie 2010; Rice and Pfennig 2010). The study of Hoskin et al. (2005) on the green-eyed treefrog Litoria genimaculata first gave strong empirical evidence of it and is one of the seminal and most appealing works on this issue. In this system, reinforcement not only completed reproductive isolation between two differentiated lineages of L. genimaculata, but has also resulted in premating isolation between populations within the same lineage. In female-choice trials under laboratory conditions, both allopatric and sympatric females were indeed observed to mate with males of their own populations (Hoskin et al. 2005; see also Smadja and Butlin 2006 for a comment). Following the study of Hoskin et al. (2005), Pfennig and Ryan (2006), in a simulation study using an artificial neuronal network, also showed that reproductive character displacement (defined broadly as “the selective process by which reproductive traits diverge to minimize costly reproductive interactions with heterospecifics,” Pfennig and Pfennig 2009) can lead to reproductive isolation between conspecific populations, and addressed in which circumstances this is more likely to occur (see also McPeek and Gavrilets 2006 and Pfennig and Ryan 2007 for other simulation studies). In addition to the greeneyed treefrog (Hoskin et al. 2005), some other species systems furnished empirical support to this prediction, although no full premating isolation was observed in these systems (for a review, see Ortiz-Barrientos et al. 2009; Hoskin and Higgie 2010). In most cases, only sympatric females were observed to reject allopatric males. The opposite behavior was observed in the Drosophila serrata/D. birchii system, where allopatric females of D. serrata rejected conspecific males from the populations sympatric with D. birchii (Higgie and Blows 2007, 2008). More recently, OrtizBarrientos et al. (2009) have dubbed the mechanism in which reinforcing selection affects sexual selection within species and, under some circumstances, leads to speciation events between sympatric and allopatric populations of a single diverging species,
the Cascade Reinforcement Hypothesis. Finally, Hoskin and Higgie (2010) broadened beyond reinforcement the idea that reproductive character displacement can lead to speciation between displaced and nondisplaced populations. They included species interactions other than hybridization that cause selection on mating traits, such as parasitism and predation, and termed this process Reproductive Character Displacement Speciation (Hoskin and Higgie 2010). Pfennig and Pfennig (2009, 2010) unified ecological character displacement (displacement of traits associated with resource use in areas where similar species or diverging taxa co-occur) and reproductive character displacement under the same conceptual framework and included reinforcement as a particular case of “character displacement” which occurs by selection against maladaptive hybridization. These authors addressed how ecological and reproductive character displacement may promote each other and how both these processes can be involved in the evolution of postmating and premating isolation between incipient species and between conspecific populations within different selective environments (Pfennig and Pfennig 2009, 2010).
Those species systems in which reproductive isolation occurred as a consequence of divergence in mating traits by natural selection provide potentially good systems to investigate the incidental effects on reproductive isolation between conspecific populations and to assess how important is the role for natural selection in initiating speciation and in contributing to the origin of biodiversity (Ortiz-Barrientos et al. 2009; Pfennig and Pfennig 2009, 2010; Hoskin and Higgie 2010).
The sea rock-pool beetles Ochthebius quadricollis and O. urbanelliae (=Ochthebius sp. A) (Urbanelli et al. 1996; Audisio et al. 2010) are one of these systems. They are two morphologically indistinguishable species of hydraenid beetles inhabiting marine rock pools in the Mediterranean basin, whose ranges are largely allopatric. A sympatric area has been detected in Italy, along the southern Tyrrenean coast, where the two species cooccur syntopically in the same rock pools (Urbanelli et al. 1996; Urbanelli 2002). By genetic analysis of sympatric populations, full reproductive isolation between the two species was evidenced (no F1 hybrids were found) (Urbanelli et al. 1996; Urbanelli 2002). The finding of introgressed individuals at some diagnostic loci exclusively in the area where the two species co-occur showed that gene flow occurred in the past but then ceased (Urbanelli 2002). Premating isolation between the two species in nature was also shown in sympatric populations by analyzing species composition of mating couples (Urbanelli and Porretta 2008). Finally, through mating trials under laboratory conditions, greater premating isolation among sympatric populations than ones allopatric was found, showing that reproductive character displacement occurred in sympatric populations (Urbanelli and Porretta 2008). Reinforcement was suggested to explain the evolution of

discriminative mate recognition systems occurring among O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae under sympatric populations (Urbanelli and Porretta 2008).
Here, we aim to test whether the evolution of discriminative mate recognition systems in sympatric populations affected also the intraspecific premating isolation within O. quadricollis and/or O. urbanelliae. The mating behavior of these species makes them especially suitable for investigation into patterns of premating isolation between individuals from different populations. Indeed, in both O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae, the first step of mating behavior is the formation of couples between females and males (with the male on the back of the female) that last for about 1 h (Beier 1956; Urbanelli and Porretta 2008). For both species, we performed two types of multiple-choice mating trials under laboratory conditions (Coyne et al. 2005). In the first, we used individuals from different conspecific allopatric populations. In the second, we used individuals from conspecific allopatric and sympatric populations. If divergence in mating traits in sympatric populations affected intraspecific premating isolation within O. quadricollis and/or O. urbanelliae, a pattern of assortative mating between sympatric and allopatric pairs of populations would be expected. In contrast, the null expectation (i.e., that divergence in mating traits in sympatric populations did not affect premating isolation between conspecific sympatric and allopatric populations) is fully random mating between populations regardless of their geographic origin.
Materials and Methods
SAMPLING
Adult individuals of O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae were collected from Italian allopatric and sympatric sites during the summers of 2007–2008 for O. quadricollis and in the years from 2007 to 2010 for O. urbanelliae (Tables 1 and 2; Figs. 1B and 2B).
The geographic ranges of O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae are mainly allopatric along the Italian Tyrrhenian coast, but an area of sympatry was found along the southern Tyrrhenian coast, where the two species co-occur syntopically in the same rock pools (Urbanelli et al. 1996; Urbanelli 2002; Urbanelli and Porretta 2008). Therefore, those sites where the species occur alone are allopatric and those sites where the species co-occur syntopically, sympatric (Urbanelli et al. 1996; Urbanelli 2002; Urbanelli and Porretta 2008). Sampling campaigns performed since 1990 have shown the stability of the sympatric area in time and space (i.e., through the years the co-occurrence of both species was confirmed in all sites, despite some differences in their proportion: 50–80%) (Urbanelli et al. 1996; Urbanelli 2002; Urbanelli and Porretta 2008; S. Urbanelli, pers. obs.).
Octhebius quadricollis and O. urbanelliae are morphologically indistinguishable species; so in sympatric populations, they may be recognized only a posteriori by genetic analyses (see below). To avoid putting heterospecific individuals in the mating chamber, we used the sympatric populations where one species occurs at a higher relative percentage (Nerano and Maratea for O. urbanelliae and Diamante for O. quadricollis). These populations, by laboratory mating trials and analyses of couples collected from the field during our previous studies, showed as high an ability to discriminate between homoand heterospecific as the sympatric population of Cirella, where the two species occur at a very similar percentage (Urbanelli and Porretta 2008). Therefore, it may be assumed that the differences in the relative abundance of the two species do not result in differences in the discrimination ability in mating, as observed in other systems (Nosil et al. 2003; Peterson et al. 2005).
The females and males collected were manually sorted by body size, placed in different plastic bottles filled with water from the rock pool of origin, and brought to the laboratory. Here, they were kept in separate aquaria until crossing.
MARKING
Because the individuals of conspecific populations of both species are morphologically and genetically indistinguishable (Urbanelli et al. 1996), we marked the populations used in mating trials with different colored paints. Before performing the mating trials, we tested the paints (1) for their toxicity and their ability to persist on the cuticle of the insect and (2) for their effects on mating behavior. The tests were performed in three replicates using individuals of O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae collected in May 2007 from Circeo and Sperlonga, respectively (Urbanelli 2002).
First, we marked two groups of 200 individuals (100 males and 100 females) with yellow and white Polycolor paint (Maimeri Spa, Milano, Italy), respectively. Each individual was marked by using a 000 grade camel hairbrush to apply one yellow or white dot of paint on the dorsal part of abdomen. We used no anesthetic during marking, and were careful to prevent paint from getting onto the articulation between the thorax and the abdomen. A control group of 200 individuals was treated in similar fashion, but not marked. Each group was placed in aquaria half-filled with seawater and covered with a net to prevent the beetles from flying out. Small rocks covered with algae collected from the sampling sites were put in the aquaria as both physical support and a food source for the adults during the breeding experiments (Coyne et al. 2005; Urbanelli and Porretta 2008). The number of beetles that had lost their paint mark and the number of dead beetles in both marked and unmarked groups was recorded at 12 h after marking. Only 2–4% of the marked beetles lost their marks, showing that the paint marks used were durable. Furthermore, there were no

significant differences in the mortality rate between marked and unmarked groups (all χ2 tests P > 0.05), showing that the paint marks were not toxic for the individuals.
Second, we tested whether the paints affected the number of couples and the male and/or female choice. We marked, as described above, 100 males and 100 females with white or yellow paints in all possible color combinations (i.e., males white and females yellow; both males and females white, both males and females yellow; males yellow and females white). A control group of 200 individuals (100 males and 100 females) was treated in similar fashion, without being marked. Each group of beetles was placed in aquaria prepared as described above. The observed mating couples were thus removed from the aquaria at intervals of 2 h during the first 12 h of the trial. We did not observe significant differences in the number of mating couples collected between the marked and unmarked groups (all χ2 tests P > 0.05). Furthermore, no biases in couple composition caused by different colors were observed (all χ2 tests P > 0.05) (data available in Dryad). On the whole, all tests showed that the paint marks used were durable, nontoxic, and that they did not affect mating behavior of O. quadricollis or O. urbanelliae.
MATING TRIALS
Within two days of the sampling, breeding experiments were performed in aquaria under the environmental conditions described in Urbanelli and Porretta (2008). Mating trials consisted of multiplechoice mating without replacement, in which males and females of both mating types are placed in a mating chamber (Coyne et al. 2005). In the beetles O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae, this is the experimental design that most realistically mimics mate choice in nature (Urbanelli and Porretta 2008).
For each mating trial, 100 females and 100 males from each population were used, for a total of 400 individuals for each mating chamber. The observed couples were removed from the aquaria at intervals of 2 h during the first 12 h of the trial. We marked each population with a specific color (yellow or white) and we alternated the colors between trials.
In a multiple-choice design, the element of choice may diminish as individuals are removed from the aquaria and the trial is lengthened to obtain the maximum number of mates (Casares et al. 1998). To avoid this issue, we stopped the trials below the limit of 50% of the potential matings, following the suggestions of Casares et al. (1998), which empirically demonstrated this to be

a safe, although conservative, value. Each component (male and female) of a collected couple belonging to the sympatric samples of Nerano, Maratea, and Diamante was analyzed by genetic analyses to verify its taxonomic status using the allozymic diagnostic loci described in Urbanelli (2002), and we discarded the couples in which heterospecific individuals were found (data available in Dryad).
We performed two types of mating trials for each species. In the first, we used individuals from different conspecific allopatric populations. In the second, we used individuals from conspecific allopatric and sympatric populations. If divergence in mating traits in sympatric populations affected intraspecific premating isolation within O. quadricollis and/or O. urbanelliae, a pattern of assortative mating between sympatric and allopatric pairs of populations would be expected. In contrast, the null expectation is that fully random mating occurs between populations regardless of their geographic origin (Ortiz-Barrientos et al. 2009 and references therein).
Because our results indicated a clear pattern of assortative mating between sympatric and allopatric populations of O. urbanelliae (see Results and Discussion section), we performed, for this species only, a third type of mating trials that involved crossing individuals from the sympatric populations of Nerano and Maratea (Fig. 2B). In this case, we would expect to find full random mating between them.
We carried out at least two replicates of each type of mating trial (Tables 1 and 2). Briefly, we sampled and used as described above: allopatric versus allopatric and sympatric versus allopatric populations of O. quadricollis, twice (in July 2007 and September 2008); allopatric versus allopatric and sympatric (Maratea, Fig. 2B) versus allopatric populations of O. urbanelliae, twice (in September 2007 and July 2008); allopatric versus allopatric and sympatric (Nerano, Fig. 2B) versus allopatric populations of O. urbanelliae, twice (in July 2009 and September 2009); sympatric versus sympatric populations (Maratea and Nerano) of O. urbanelliae, twice (in July 2010 and September 2010).
The degree of sexual isolation among conspecific populations in both O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae was assessed by using the IPSI estimator (Rola ́n-Alvarez and Caballero 2000) as implemented in the software JMATING (Carvajal-Rodriguez and Rola ́n-Alvarez 2006).
Following Rola ́n-Alvarez and Caballero (2000), for each of the four mating combinations (two homotypic aa and bb and two

heterotypic combinations ab and ba), an estimator of pair sexual isolation (PSI) is computed as the number of observed mating pairs for a particular combination over the number of matings for this combination that would be expected if mating among individuals that actually mated was random. The IPSI estimator is computed from the four PSI values (PSIaa , PSIbb , PSIab , and PSIba ) and quantifies the sexual isolation component based mainly on mate choice by removing the effects of different mating propensities of distinct populations (Carvajal-Rodriguez and Rola ́n-Alvarez 2006). It can take values between −1 and 1, where zero indicates random mating, and 1 and −1 indicate that only homoor heterotypic matings were observed. Bootstrapping (100,000 resamplings) was used to calculate mean bootstrap values, standard deviations, and the two-tail probabilities for rejecting the null hypothesis of random mating (IPSI = 0). A comparative study showed IPSI to be the most reliable estimator of sexual isolation caused by mating preferences, and also when there is uncertainty in the frequency of the two morphs or in the mating propensity of individuals, as in our case (Pe ́rez-Figuero et al. 2005; Urbanelli and Porretta 2008).
Sexual isolation may be asymmetric because of differences in the ability of females and/or males to discriminate between homoand heterotype partners (Svensson et al. 2007). To assess the possible occurrence of asymmetric isolation, we therefore used the indices of asymmetry IAPSI as implemented in the software JMATING (Carvajal-Rodriguez and Rola ́n-Alvarez 2006). As with IPSI , the indices of asymmetry (IAPSI ) can be calculated by taking the ratio of PSI values for the two homoand heterotypic combinations, respectively, (PSIab and PSIba) (Carvajal-Rodriguez and Rola ́n-Alvarez 2006). An IAPSI of 1 indicates symmetric mating frequencies between the two mating combinations that were compared. Bootstrapping (100,000 resamplings) was used to calculate mean bootstrap values, standard deviations, and the two-tail probabilities for rejecting the null hypothesis of symmetry in mating (IAPSI = 1).
Results and Discussion
Different patterns of intraspecific matings were observed in the two species. For O. quadricollis, no deviations from random mating were observed either in crosses between allopatric populations or in crosses between allopatric and sympatric populations (for all IPSI statistics ∗P > 0.05), regardless of the geographic origin of
 O. quadricollis. In allopatric × allopatric mating trials, for each replicate IPSI value was not significant, ∗P > 0.05. In sympatric × allopatric mating trials, for each replicate IPSI value was significant, P < 0.001. In sympatric × sympatric mating trials, for each replicate IPSI value was not significant, ∗P > 0.05 (Table 2). (B) Map showing the populations of O. urbanelliae studied.

         the samples (Fig. 1, Table 1). No deviations from symmetry were observed in any trials (for all IAPSI, statistics ∗∗P > 0.05). Conversely, in O. urbanelliae, although no deviations from random mating were observed in crosses between allopatric populations (for all IPSI statistics ∗P > 0.05) and between the sympatric populations of Nerano and Maratea (for all IPSI statistics ∗P > 0.05) (Fig. 2A, Table 2), in the crosses between allopatric and sympatric populations, highly significant departures from random mating were observed (for all IPSI statistics ∗P < 0.001) (Fig. 2A, Table 2). For O. urbanelliae only, therefore, mating trials showed (1) a clear pattern of assortative mating between the sympatric populations with O. quadricollis and those allopatric; (2) random mating between sympatric populations and between allopatric populations. This is the mating pattern expected if divergence in mating traits in sympatric populations affected intraspecific premating isolation as well.
Sympatric–allopatric populations are separated by unsuitable habitats for the beetles such as sand stretches, and rocky shores with steep slope, whereas sympatric populations are not. Therefore, the assortative mating observed between sympatric and allopatric populations of O. urbanelliae could alternatively be driven by casual changes due to geographic isolation between groups of populations. This latter hypothesis, however, is unlikely. Indeed, unsuitable habitats occur also between allopatric– allopatric populations and the pattern of premating isolation observed in our study does not agree either the geographical barriers between populations or the pattern of genetic differentiation among them (Urbanelli et al. 1996; Urbanelli 2002). For example, the allopatric populations used in this study of Sperlonga and Talamone are separated by long sand stretches (see, e.g., Google Earth for detailed maps). These habitats (associated with the low dispersal ability of the species, Beier 1956) can reduce the exchange of individuals between the two populations. Previous genetic studies on O. urbanelliae populations using allozyme markers support this. Indeed, the genetic analyses showed that the populations of Latium (such as Sperlonga, Fig. 2) and of Tuscany (such as Talamone, Fig. 2) belong to distinct genetic groups of populations which show significant values of the Weir and Cockerman (1984) FST differentiation index (FST = 0.452, P < 0.001), and gene flow values (Nm(FST)) of 0.30 (Urbanelli 2002). The unsuitable habitats between Sperlonga and Talamone, however, do not affect the premating pattern between them. Indeed, they show no premating barriers (Table 2; Fig. 2). More generally, allopatric populations, regardless of their genetic differentiation or the occurrence of unsuitable habitats, do not show premating barriers (Table 2; Fig. 2). On the contrary, premating isolation occurs only between the allopatric populations and those sympatric with O. quadricollis.
Despite the significant premating isolation observed between conspecific allopatric and sympatric populations of O. urbanelliae, we observed some heteropopulation couples in the crosses
between them (Fig. 2A, Table 2). However, it is noticeable that: (1) under laboratory conditions, premating isolation may be weaker than in nature (Rundle and Schluter 2004; Jennings and Etges 2010); (2) the observed frequency of heteropopulation couples was within the observed frequency range of heterospecific couples in laboratory conditions (11–16%) between sympatric populations of O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae, which are fully isolated in nature (Urbanelli and Porretta 2008); (3) our experimental system underestimates premating isolation, as we analyze only the coupling behavior but ignore all postcoupling stages of mating up to egg fertilization. Therefore, it may be reasonably hypothesized that in nature the premating isolation would be greater than that observed here. It is also to be noted that, as discussed above, the low dispersal ability of the species and the occurrence of unsuitable habitats between sympatric and allopatric groups of populations can restrict migration between sympatric and allopatric groups of populations (Urbanelli 2002). The analyses of other stages of mating, such as sperm transfer, in the heteropopulation couples could give us insights into the effective premating isolation between individuals (Arnqvist and Rowe 2005). Likewise, genetic studies aimed at investigating the genetic divergence specifically between allopatric and sympatric populations would give us insights into the actual reproductive isolation between these groups of populations in nature (Rice and Pfennig 2010). If reduced gene flow occurs between sympatric and allopatric populations, greater genetic distance would be expected between sympatric versus allopatric populations than between sympatric versus sympatric and allopatric versus allopatric populations. On the other hand, because natural selection may drive rapid mating trait divergence (Higgie et al. 2000; Hoskin et al. 2005) and likely acts on a limited number of genes (Coyne and Orr 2004), allopatric and sympatric populations may not differ at neutral loci (Ortiz-Barrientos et al. 2009; Hoskin and Higgie 2010). No genetic studies on O. urbanelliae populations have investigated genetic divergence specifically between sympatric versus allopatric populations. Highly polymorphic genetic markers such as microsatellites would be useful to address this issue (Rice and Pfennig 2010).
The possible contribution of both reproductive and ecological displacement in the evolution of the mating pattern observed in the Ochthebius system is another issue that could be the focus of further research (Pfennig and Pfennig 2009, 2010). When two similar species or diverging taxa come into contact, they may also compete for resources as well as for reproduction (Pfennig and Pfennig 2010 and references therein). This is the case, for example, with the spadefoot toads Spea multiplicata and S. bombifrons. In this species system, ecological character displacement (in tadpoles’ trophic morphology) and reinforcement contributed both to complete the process of speciation and to initiate speciation between sympatric and allopatric populations of S. multiplicata (Pfennig

and Rice 2007; Rice and Pfennig 2010 and references therein). If some divergence in resource use has occurred, morphological differences would be expected between the species or between conspecific populations (Kawano 2002; Dayan and Simberloff 2005). This is not the case with O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae, where no morphological differences have been observed between species and conspecific populations (for a brief review see Urbanelli et al. 1996; Urbanelli and Porretta 2008). However, it cannot be completely excluded that, in addition to reinforcement, ecological character displacement between the species may have contributed to the patterns of assortative mating observed (Pfennig and Pfennig 2009, 2010).
In conclusion, in this article, we tested in two species of sea rock-pool beetles, O. quadricollis and O. urbanelliae, the prediction that the evolution by natural selection of divergence in mate recognition systems in sympatric but not allopatric populations can affect mate choice within species as well. Our results showed significant premating reproductive isolation between the populations of O. urbanelliae sympatric with O. quadricollis and their conspecific allopatric populations. The case of O. urbanelliae strongly supports the above prediction, as it does the active role in initiating speciation of natural selection originating from species interactions.
