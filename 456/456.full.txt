Abstract.—The switch from feeding to nonfeeding larvae is an ecologically important transformation that has evolved on several separate occasions within the echinoids. In each case, this life history transformation has been accompanied by extensive changes in larval morphology. A phylogenetic approach is used here to reconstruct these morphological changes, to begin asking why they have taken the particular forms observed, and to assess the degree of parallel transformation in separate cases. Both traditional character mapping and a less usual aggregate analysis indicate massively parallel transformations in larval morphology associated with, and only with, this particular life history transformation. Some of these parallel morphological transformations may be due to relaxed functional constraints associated with the ancestral life history mode, but many are probably the result of new functional constraints associated with the derived mode. The comparative data suggest a simple and testable model for the switch from feeding to nonfeeding larvae involving three sequential steps. [Larva; life history evolution; developmental evolution; disparity; Echinoidea.]
 One of the many interesting challenges facing an evolutionary biologist is understanding why organisms have changed in particular ways during the history of a clade. Because the evolutionary transformations separating even closely related organisms are unique, distinguishing chance associations from causal relationships can be difficult (Lauder, 1982; Cracraft, 1990; Baum and Larson, 1991). Does a species possess a particular derived feature because of a habitat shift, utilization of a new food source, linkage disequilibrium with some other feature, or chance? Distinguishing among these and the many other possibilities is a problem whether one is interested in genes, morphology, behavior, physiology, development, or any other heritable feature of an organism.
One way of dealing with this problem is to examine replicate transformations in a gross feature of organismal function, such as mode of feeding or reproduction, and to ask whether any specific transformations in morphology, physiology, or behavior are consistently associated with them (Lauder, 1990; Maddison, 1990; Baum and Larson, 1991; Wray and Bely, 1994). A robust phylogenetic hypothesis is needed to demonstrate that the gross functional transformations are indeed independent (e.g., flight in tetrapods) and to identify correlat-
ed apomorphies (e.g., light bones, enlarged sternum). Where there is a reason for expecting particular apomorphies on the basis of function, this approach can provide evidence for adaptation (Lauder, 1990; Baum and Larson, 1991). Alternatively, where the functional transformation is not well understood, this approach can be used to generate new adaptive hypotheses by identifying previously unsuspected correlations. In either case, a phylogenetic framework can also be used to generate hypotheses about the order in which complex suites of functionally correlated traits are assembled.
In this paper, I use a phylogenetic approach to examine replicate switches from feeding (planktotrophic) to nonfeeding (lecithotrophic) larval development in the Echinoidea, a large clade of echinoderms containing the sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea biscuits. The evolution of nonfeeding larvae is an ecologically significant transformation in echinoderms, as it is in many animal phyla (Strathmann, 1985; Jablonski, 1986; Havenhand, 1995). Development by means of a feeding larva is almost certainly the plesiomorphic life history mode among echinoids specifically and echinoderms in general (Jagersten,
1972; Strathmann, 1985; Raff, 1987). Ceding echinoid larvae are morphologically

complex and are known as plutei. Although disparate in general appearance (Fig. la), plutei share an extensive suite of synapomorphic structures not found in other echinoderm classes (Wray, 1992). The phylogenetic distribution of developmental modes among extant echinoids indicates that nonfeeding development has evolved from feeding development at least 14 times (Emlet, 1990); adding cases of brooding from fossil evidence raises this estimate to 20 (e.g., Kier, 1969; Philip and Foster, 1971; Roman, 1983). Nonfeeding echinoid larvae are morphologically derived and rather diverse (Fig. lb), but several authors have noted parallel features among them (Raff, 1987; Parks et al., 1989; Emlet, 1991; Wray and Raff, 1991). The most highly derived nonfeeding larvae have a simple prolate shape and are called schmoos. Two echinoids have larvae that can feed but do not need to do so to complete metamorphosis (Emlet, 1986; Hart, 1996). These facultatively feeding larvae are not morphologically derived (Fig. lc) and resemble their closest obligately feeding relatives.
These observations raise a number of questions. Why are nonfeeding larvae modified in specific ways and not others? Are nonfeeding larvae only superficially similar? Does the evolution of a schmoo involve a single step or several? If several steps are involved, is there a single route to a schmoo or are there many ways this can happen? The following analyses bring together the rich but scattered literature on the comparative morphology of echinoid larvae so that these issues can be addressed. Throughout, an explicit phylogenetic framework is used to generate hypotheses about the transformation from feeding to nonfeeding development in echinoids that can be tested through additional comparative data or other approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Phylogenetic Framework
Recently, Littlewood and Smith (1995) used a total evidence approach to estimate echinoid phylogeny, combining sequence
data and adult morphology (143 phylogenetically informative nucleotide sites from large subunit and small subunit ribosomal genes and 145 adult morphological features); in a second total evidence analysis (Smith et al., 1995), 40 larval morphological features were added. The results of the two total evidence analyses do not differ in any way that affects the taxa considered here, and for the present analyses they are assumed to be correct (Fig. 2). Of the 19 genera considered in this study, 6 were not included in either total evidence analysis. These genera can, however, confidently be assigned to an order or suborder with a representative that was included in the total evidence analysis. None of the eight species with facultatively feeding or nonfeeding larvae belong to the same order or suborder as any of the others, with the exception of the two Phyllacanthus species, which are almost certainly sister taxa. Thus, even if the phylogenetic hypothesis shown in Figure 2 is wrong in detail, such errors will not affect reconstructions of character transformations associated with any of the internodes during which there was a shift to a derived life history mode.
Comparative Data
A data matrix was constructed for 19 echinoids (11 with obligately feeding larvae, 2 with facultatively feeding larvae, and 6 with nonfeeding larvae) and one ophiuroid (outgroup). These 20 species were scored for 63 morphological features of larvae (55 characters) and embryos (8 characters) (Table 1). Character diagnoses are provided in the Appendix.
Methods of Analysis
PAUP 3.1.1 (Swofford, 1993) was used to build a tree using the larval data set. The outgroup for these calculations was either the feeding larva of an ophiuroid, Ophiopholis aculeata, or the inferred ancestral states for echinoids (hypothetical ancestor, Table 1) (Wray, 1992). Trees were calculated under assumptions of maximum parsimony with all characters weighted equally. Multistate characters were considered unordered, with the exception of charac-

FIGURE 1. Morphology of echinoid larvae, (a) Obligately feeding larvae. Echinoid larvae that feed share an extensive suite of morphological and functional features (Strathmann, 1971; Wray, 1992). For example, a calcar-
eous endoskeleton with a complex and distinctive shape supports arms that are used for feeding. Even distantly related species share many detailed features of larval anatomy. Larvae (left to right) are Eucidaris tribubides (Cidaroida), Diadema setosum (Diadematoida), Spatangus purpureus (Spantangoida), Dendraster excentricus (Clypeasteroida), Arbacia punctulata (Phymosomatoida), Temnopleurus hardwickii (Temnopleuroida), Lytechinus variegatus (Echinoida), and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinoida). (b) Nonfeeding larvae. Larvae that do not feed are superficially more diverse, and most look quite different from feeding larvae. Some, however, have a reduced endoskeleton and arms. Marked disparity in larval morphology can arise despite close phylogenetic relationships, as in the larvae of the two species of Phyllacanthus illustrated here. Larvae (left to right) are Phyllacanthus imperialis (Cidaroida), Peronella japonica (Clypeasteroida), Asthenosoma ijimai (Echinothurioida), Heliocidaris erythrogramma (Echinoida), Phyllacanthus parvispinus (Cidaroida), and Holopneustes purpurescens (Temnopleuroida). (c) Facultatively feeding larvae. These larvae resemble the obligately feeding larvae of their close relatives (Emlet, 1986; Hart, 1996).

ters 1, 2, 29, and 40. These characters were considered ordered because character state 1 seemed obviously intermediate between states 0 and 2. Character transformations were reconstructed using MacClade 3.01 (Maddison and Maddison, 1992). Reconstructions used one of two different tree topologies: the total evidence tree described above (Fig. 2) and the results of the phylogenetic analysis of the larval data set (Fig. 3), described below. As with the topology calculations, in these reconstructions all characters were weighted equally and all character transformations were considered equally likely, with the exception of the four ordered multistate characters.
RESUL TS
Morphological Transformations Associated with the Ecological Shift
No apomorphic character states are known only from facultatively feeding larvae. Two apomorphic character states are
shared by all facultatively feeding and nonfeeding larvae but are not found in any obligately feeding larvae. One character is large egg size (>200 |xm diameter), a feature thought to be necessary, and perhaps sufficient, for the loss of obligate feeding (Wray and Raff, 1991; Wray and Bely, 1994; Hart, 1996). The other apomorphic state is opaque ectoderm, which may result from increased numbers of lipid droplets in cytoplasm derived from larger "yolky" eggs (Henry et a l , 1991).
A further 24 apomorphic states in 20 characters are present only in nonfeeding larvae. Most of these are reconstructed as having evolved in parallel in more than one obligately nonfeeding larva, and 10 are reconstructed as having evolved on all five occasions. None of these apomorphic states are present in either facultative feeder. Character states exclusively associated with nonfeeding larva include novel features (e.g., thicker ectoderm, increased cell number, ciliated band moved, initially

Species not included in either of these studies are assumed to belong to the orders or suborders to which they are traditionally assigned. Importantly for the present analysis, the eight study species with derived developmental modes almost certainly represent seven independent transformations that have occurred in seven different families in six different orders (Raff, 1987; Emlet, 1990; Hart, 1996). Beyond this assumption of seven independent transformations, the precise topology of the tree does not significantly affect the analyses described here.

larger adult rudiment) and truncation or loss of existing features (e.g., reduced skeleton, no larval mouth, loss of particular skeletal elements, loss of ciliated band). The tight phylogenetic correlation between developmental mode and these character states suggests that they are not coincidental to the life history shift but are functionally related to it. Were it otherwise, we would expect to see these features show up at least occasionally in the many species with feeding larvae, as has happened for only 2 of the 24 derived character states: loss of the posterior skeletal element, which has occurred at least twice among feeding echinoid larvae, and loss of the paired posterodorsal skeletal elements, which has occurred at least once (Wray, 1992). The general tendency towards reduction and loss of skeletal elements in nonfeeding larvae indicates that skeletal elements can be lost for more than one reason rather than that the losses in nonfeeding larvae are unrelated to the switch in life history mode.
Many of the apomorphic character states restricted to nonfeeding larvae have straightforward functional interpretations. Parallel losses of larval structures used for gathering and processing food may result from relaxed functional constraints. For example, the larval skeleton, whose primary function is supporting the larval arms that are used to feed (Strathmann, 1971; Hart, 1991), is either reduced or absent in all nonfeeding echinoid larvae. Similarly, most nonfeeding larvae lack a mouth, and the gut is typically not differentiated into the pharynx, stomach, and intestine of feeding larvae. However, parallel modifications that shorten metamorphic development may represent adaptations to the new life history mode. Because larval mortality is severe (Rumrill, 1990; Morgan, 1995), nonfeeding larvae should be under strong selection to reduce the time to metamorphosis. Species with nonfeeding larvae generally do take less time to reach metamorphosis than do relatives with obligately feeding larvae (Parks et al., 1989). Reducing or eliminating the larval skeleton, not forming the larval mouth, and not
differentiating the larval gut are all potentially time-saving modifications in development. These transformations also could be the result of drift following relaxed functional constraints or of selection to reduce needless expenditure of energy. Other derived features, such as the greatly accelerated synthesis of adult skeleton and the formation of the adult rudiment at full size rather than through gradual growth, do not involve structural simplification and are most plausibly interpreted as adaptations for rapid premetamorphic development. Several modifications in developmental mechanisms identified in a previous study may also be adaptations for shortening premetamorphic development (Wray and Bely, 1994).
Cladograms Based on Larval Morphology
To examine the degree of morphological convergence among nonfeeding larvae, the larval data set (Table 1) was used to build a tree. This aggregate approach provides a way of assessing the degree to which many characters change in parallel by comparing the topology of the resulting tree with independent estimates of phylogeny. The point of this analysis is not to estimate phylogeny but to assess the degree of parallel transformation among several characters.
Using the larva of the ophiuroid Ophiopholis aculeata as the outgroup, 12 shortest trees of length 110 were found by branchand-bound search. The strict consensus tree of these is shown in Figure 3. The ingroup consists of two major clades that segregate by life history mode, one composed of feeding larvae and the other of nonfeeding larvae (Fig. 4). Both facultatively feeding larvae are included in the feeding clade. Separate calculations using
a hypothetical ancestral echinoid (reconstructed from Wray, 1992) as an outgroup produced a poorly resolved tree, with 54 shortest trees of length 105. The strict consensus topology differed from that produced with Ophiopholis as outgroup: nonfeeding larvae still formed a clade, but the clade moved inside the group of feeding larvae (Fig. 4).

FIGURE 4. Larval characters produce a clade of nonfeeding larvae. The larval data set (Table 1) produces a tree topology that unites all six species with nonfeeding larvae ( • ) into a clade (black bar). This result is obtained with two very different choices of outgroup: (a) the larva of the ophiuroid Ophiopholis acukata or (b) a hypothetical ancestral echinoid larva whose morphology is based on reconstructed plesiomorphic features for crown group echinoids (Wray, 1992). Facultatively feeding larvae (•) are not part of the nonfeeding clade when Ophiopholis is used as an outgroup, but the larva of Clypeaster rosaceus is the sister taxon to the nonfeeding clade when the hypothetical ancestral echinoid larva is used as an outgroup.
des and sister taxa. The sole stirodont (Glyptocidaris) is not recovered as the sister group of camarodonts (Temnopleurus, Lytechinus, Tripneustes, Echinus, Strongylocentrotus) but is mixed within them or not resolved. By the criterion of congruence with previous cladistic analyses (Smith et al., 1993, 1995;Littlewood and Smith, 1995), the larval morphology data set is able to resolve the deeper divergences among echinoids fairly well.
The really glaring incongruity is that the six species in the nonfeeding "clade" produced from the larval data set (Figs. 3, 4) are traditionally and on the basis of total evidence assigned to five different orders (Fig. 2). Feeding larvae representing four of these orders are placed within the feeding clade using Ophiopholis as outgroup and within a paraphyletic feeding grade using the hypothetical ancestor as outgroup. (The fifth order contains only nonfeeding larvae, so this comparison is not possible.) There is no evidence, other than larval morphology, to assume that the five genera with nonfeeding larvae share a common phylogenetic history. The nonfeeding larvae of the two Phyllacanthus species may well share a common origin. However, these larvae do not superficially
resemble each other (Fig. 1) and are not united as sister taxa in a maxium parsimony analysis of the larval data set (Fig. 3). Topological relationships within the nonfeeding "clade" were identical using either outgroup.
No hypothesis of echinoid phylogeny has posited a close relationship among any of the five genera with nonfeeding larvae. Based on adult morphology, each clearly belongs to their traditionally designated orders. Molecular data are only available for two of the species with nonfeeding larvae, Asthenosoma ijimai a n d Heliocidaris erythrogramma. In both cases, the molecular data strongly support the traditional phylogenetic position based on adult morphology (Raff et al., 1988; Smith et al.,
Using either outgroup, relationships
among feeding larvae are consistent with
but less fully resolved than the best cur-
rent estimate of "true" phylogenetic rela-
tionships among echinoids (Fig. 2) (Smith
et al., 1993, 1995; Littlewood and Smith,
1995). The most basal split within crown
group echinoids, that between the Cida-
roida and Euechinoida, is correctly recov-
ered (Eucidaris vs. the remaining genera). 1990; McMillan et al., 1992; Littlewood and Spatangoids (Spatangus, Brisaster) and clypSmith, 1995). Thus, it seems extremely uneasteroids (Arachnoides, Dendraster, Encope, likely that the "clade" composed of species Clypeaster) are correctly recovered as clawith nonfeeding larvae is a real one.

Instead, it is much more likely that these taxa have been grouped because they share an extensive suite of parallel morphological transformations. Positing a true phylogenetic affinity would be like claiming pterosaurs, bats, and birds form a clade because they have elongated bones in their forelimbs, an enlarged sternum, and enlarged pectoralis muscles. In the case of flying tetrapods, these similarities represent parallel transformations due to the functional demands of a new lifestyle. The same is very likely true of many derived morphological features of nonfeeding echinoid larvae. Unlike flying tetrapods, however, the parallel morphological transformations in nonfeeding echinoid larvae overwhelm and mask features that might otherwise recover the true phylogeny. If the adults of these species had been unavailable for study, larval morphology would have fooled us, at least until a robust molecular data set became available.
In contrast, the two species with facultatively feeding larvae are correctly placed among the obligately feeding larvae as sister taxa to their probable closest relatives. Because the larval data set contains many characters only known to vary among species with feeding larvae and because many species with feeding larvae were included in the analysis, the correct placement of both facultative feeders is significant and reinforces the impression that their morphology is not derived. These results suggest either that selection has maintained plesiomorphic features in these larvae or that facultative feeding has evolved very recently.
Phylogmms Based on Larval Morphology
Overall morphological disparity provides another approach to understanding the evolution of nonfeeding larvae. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to methods for analyzing disparity, despite its obvious evolutionary importance (Gould, 1991; Foote, 1993; Wills et al., 1994). Phylograms (cladograms with branch lengths scaled to the number of reconstructed transformations) provide a simple measure of disparity that takes

FIGURE 5. Phylograms of larval disparity. Phylograms were produced by optimizing changes in the same larval morphology data set over two different tree topologies, (a) Optimization over the "false" tree topology estimated from the larval data set (Fig. 3). The longest branch is that supporting the false clade of nonfeeding larvae, (b) Optimization over the "true" tree topology (Fig. 2) (Mooi, 1990; Littlewood and Smith, 1995; Smith et al., 1995). Branches leading to nonfeeding larvae ( • ) are all long relative to those where there is no shift in larval trophic mode. In contrast, the branches leading to facultatively feeding larvae (•) are no longer than those leading to obligately feeding larvae (•). Independent calculations under assumptions of accelerated or delayed transformation did not qualitatively alter these results. Tree statistics differ significantly between these two optimizations (Table 2).
phylogenetic history into account. Optimizing transformations in larval morphology over the "true" tree (consensus best estimate of phylogenetic relationships; Fig. 2) and over the "false" tree (estimated from larval morphology alone; Fig. 3) produced the two phylograms shown in Figure 5.

fewer steps over the "true" topology (Fig. 6). Optimizations over the "false" topology require substantially less homoplasy than those over the "true" topology by several standard measures, including the consistency index, rescaled consistency index, and retention index (Table 2). Thus, by the criteria of tree length and homoplasy, the "true" tree requires one to posit significantly more evolutionary transformations than does the "false" tree, another reflection of the degree to which nonfeeding larvae have evolved in strongly parallel ways.
DISCUSSION: THE SCHMOO SYNDROME
Independent origins of nonfeeding development in the Echinoidea have involved extensive parallel transformations in the morphology of early life history phases. These parallelisms form a syndrome of morphological features (Seilacher, 1990) that suggest a degree of predictability in the evolution of larval morphology under parallel ecological circumstances. Some morphological transformations may be adaptations for a nonfeeding mode of development, and others may have resulted from relaxed selection on structures involved in feeding. The comparative evidence is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that selection has shaped much of the morphology of nonfeeding larvae, as suggested earlier for feeding larvae (Wray, 1992).
The comparative data suggest a simple and testable model for the evolutionary switch from feeding to nonfeeding larvae in echinoids (Fig. 7) (Wray and Raff, 1991; Raff, 1992; Hart, 1996). The first step in this switch is becoming a facultative feeder. This change probably is very simple developmentally, perhaps only involving an increase in egg volume. This hypothesis is testable experimentally: a facultative feeder should become an obligate feeder if its egg size is reduced, whereas an obligate feeder should become a facultative feeder (but not a nonfeeder) if its egg size is sufficiently increased. The small number of species with facultatively feeding larvae suggests that this life history mode is either relatively transient or is only useful

this internode involved characters with consistency indices of 1.00, and a further four characters with consistency indices of 1.00 support the next node within the nonfeeding "clade." Given the near certainly that the five genera in the nonfeeding "clade" represent five independent life history transformations, these relatively long nonhomoplastic branches provide good evidence for an extensive suite of parallel transformations in larval morphology specific to the switch from feeding to nonfeeding larvae. (The "long branches attract" artifact is unlikely to be the reason that the nonfeeding larvae are grouped as a clade because most of the characters supporting this node have very high consistency indices.) On the "true" phylogram, the five longest branches lead to the five genera with nonfeeding larvae (Fig. 5b, solid boxes), and branches leading to facultatively feeding larvae (gray boxes) are much shorter, about as long as those leading to obligately feeding larvae (open boxes), no matter which tree topology is used to optimize character transformations. These results underscore the large morphological disparity associated with each of the five shifts to nonfeeding larvae and
its absence in the two shifts to facultatively feeding larvae.
Additional useful information emerges from comparing the tree statistics of the two phylograms shown in Figure 5. The tree length of the "true" phylogram is 1.8 times that of the "false" phylogram (Table 2), a considerable gain in overall length. This added tree length comes from a broad range of characters within the data set, with only two characters producing

FIGURE 6. Source of tree length differences between "true" and "false" tree topologies. A per-character comparison of the tree length differences between the "true" and "false" tree topologies was carried out using MacClade's "compare two trees" procedure. The "false" tree is shorter by 89 steps in 34 characters, whereas the "true" tree is shorter by only 3 steps in 2 characters. The net result is that the "false" tree is 86 steps shorter than the "true" tree.
under a restricted set of circumstances (Emlet, 1986; Hart, 1996). This first step may be reversible, but the next two probably are not.
The second step in the switch is losing the ability to feed. Any of a large number of rather simple changes could produce this ecologically significant transformation, such as loss of a critical digestive enzyme, lack of the ciliary coordination required to intercept food particles, or failure to complete morphogenesis of the larval mouth. This second step may be transient; all known nonfeeding larvae of echinoids have a highly derived morphology (Mortensen, 1921; Wray, 1992). The lack of known nonfeeding larvae with only slightly derived morphology will make it difficult to understand exactly how feeding is
lost and whether different routes to the loss of feeding are indeed possible.
The third step in the switch involves minimizing the time required to complete metamorphosis. Strong selection for avoiding the unnecessary risk of a prolonged planktonic phase is expected for species that no longer need to feed. Unlike the first two steps, this third step seems to be very complex; it involves numerous changes in larval morphology, the result of changes in a surprising variety of developmental processes (Wray and Raff, 1991; Raff, 1992; Wray and Bely, 1994). The complexity and variety of these changes suggests that they are not simply pleiotropic consequences of the increase in egg size but instead represent multiple transformations. Consistent with this inference is the fact that the eggs

of Brisoster latifrons, a facultative feeder with generally plesiomorphic morphology, are substantially larger than those of Peronella japonica, a nonfeeder with a highly derived morphology.
The larvae of existing echinoids can plausibly be arranged along the pathway just outlined. The larvae of most echinoids are obligate feeders (Emlet et alv 1987; Raff, 1987). The larvae of two species are interpreted as having completed the first step but not the second because they can feed but do not need to (Emlet, 1986; Hart, 1996). The nonfeeding larvae represent various points along the much more complicated third step. R>r example, some have reduced larval skeletons and others have none, and adult skeleton formation is mod-
estly accelerated in some and greatly accelerated in others. The larvae furthest along the third step are the most highly convergent in morphology.
Exactly how each of these three steps is accomplished probably can differ in detail as long as the same functional result is achieved. The various combinations of plesiomorphic and apomorphic states among independently derived nonfeeding larvae provide good evidence that degrees of freedom exist in the third step. Until more is known about changes in oogenesis associated with the evolution of large eggs, however, it will not be clear whether it is possible to achieve the ecological transformation to facultative feeding in only one or in several different ways.
This model may be more generally applicable, with appropriate modifications. In other echinoderm classes, for example, nonfeeding larvae range from those that retain reduced but recognizable skeletons (Mladenov, 1979; Hendler, 1982) to schmoos that are quite similar to those of
ponents of that shift, as indicated by the conserved morphology of facultative feeders and the rather different mixes of plesiomorphic and apomorphic morphology among independently derived nonfeeding larvae. Some nonfeeding larvae seem to represent intermediate steps towards the most highly derived schmoo larvae (Olson et al., 1993).

FIGURE 7. The schmoo syndrome. The analyses presented here suggest a simple and testable model for evolutionary transformations in the morphology of echinoid larvae that are associated with the loss of feeding (Wray and Raff, 1991; Raff, 1992; Olson et al., 1993; Hart, 1996). The transition from obligate to facultative feeding seems to neither require nor entail many morphological changes in larval form. In contrast, the transition to nonfeeding larvae involves a suite of specific anatomical transformations that have evolved in parallel on several occasions. Most of these changes probably represent sequelae to the ecological shift to nonfeeding larvae rather than necessary com-
