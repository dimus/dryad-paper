Environmental and biological controls on the diversity and ecology of Late Cretaceous through early Paleogene marine ecosystems in the U.S. Gulf Coastal Plain

Abstract.—The late Mesozoic through early Cenozoic is an interval of significant biologic turnover and ecologic reorganization within marine assemblages, but the timing and causes of these changes remain poorly understood. Here, we quantify the pattern and timing of shifts in the diversity (richness and evenness) and ecology of local (i.e., sample level) mollusk-dominated assemblages during this critical interval using field-collected and published data sets from the U.S. Gulf Coastal Plain. We test whether the biologic and ecologic patterns observed primarily at the global level during this time are also expressed at the local level, and whether the end-Cretaceous (K/Pg) mass extinction and recovery moderated these trends. To explore whether environment had any effect on these patterns, we examine data from shallow subtidal and offshore settings.
Assemblages from both settings recovered to pre-extinction diversity levels rapidly, in less than 7 million years. Following initial recovery, diversity remained unchanged in both settings. The trajectory of ecological restructuring was distinct for each setting in the wake of the K/Pg extinction. In offshore assemblages, the abundance and number of predatory carnivorous taxa dramatically increased, and surficial sessile suspension feeders were replaced by more active suspension feeders. In contrast, shallow subtidal assemblages did not experience ecological reorganization following the K/Pg extinction. The distinct ecological patterns displayed in each environment follow onshoreoffshore patterns of innovation, whereby evolutionary novelties first appear in onshore settings relative to offshore habitats. Increased predation pressure may explain the significant ecological restructuring of offshore assemblages, whereby the explosive radiation of predators drove changes in their prey. Habitat-specific ecological restructuring, and its occurrence solely during the recovery interval, implies that disturbance and incumbency were also key in mediating these ecological changes.

Introduction
Some of the fundamental questions that have dominated paleobiological research for the last 40 years concern whether marine biodiversity significantly increased during the Phanerozoic, and what processes were responsible for driving this diversification (e.g., Valentine 1969; Raup 1976; Bambach 1977; Sepkoski et al. 1981; Alroy et al. 2001, 2008; Alroy 2010a). Recent analyses using abundance data and new analytical techniques have challenged the conventional view that global marine biodiversity markedly rose through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. In particular, the Cretaceous through Cenozoic
was once thought to have experienced a pronounced increase in global diversity (Sepkoski et al. 1981; Sepkoski 1993, 1997; Benton 1995; Bambach et al. 2002; Jablonski et al. 2003). However, when new methodologies for tabulating, evaluating, and standardizing fossil collections were used, an unconstrained increase was not observed in global (Alroy et al. 2001, 2008; Alroy 2008, 2010b; Wall et al. 2009), regional (Peters and Foote 2001; Crampton et al. 2006), or local (Kosnik 2005; Kowalewski et al. 2006) diversity patterns across this interval; instead, a much more moderate rise is observed at all spatial scales.

Mesozoic through Cenozoic by comparing diversity estimates from the early part of the purported global increase with those from the latter part. For example, Kowalewski et al. (2006) compared Jurassic and Neogene biotas, and Kosnik (2005) compared Late Cretaceous and middle Eocene assemblages. Here, we focus on a more continuous, approximately 35-Myr interval from the Late Cretaceous to early Eocene. This interval includes the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction, during which local, regional, and global diversity plunged (Sepkoski et al. 1981; Hansen et al. 1987, 1993a,b, 2004; Jablonski and Raup 1995; Jablonski 1998), and a subsequent recovery phase with rapid diversification (Miller and Sepkoski 1988; Hansen et al. 1993b, 2004; Harries 1999). We evaluate longterm trends across this interval, the effects of the K/Pg extinction, and the factors that influenced the early Paleogene radiation and its rate in local assemblages (i.e., bulk samples from individual locations) dominated by mollusks from the Gulf Coastal Plain region (GCP; Georgia through Texas) of the United States.
Ecological reorganization and innovation during the late Mesozoic through early Cenozoic was no less dramatic than the diversity drop at the K/Pg boundary. The Late Cretaceous was characterized by the development of several predatory innovations in gastropods (Vermeij 1977, 1987, 2008) and decapods (Schweitzer and Feldmann 2010), and invertebrate and vertebrate predators underwent a spectacular radiation (Stanley 1972, 1977; Vermeij 1977, 1987, 1994, 2008; Kowalewski et al. 1998; Bambach 2002; Alexander and Dietl 2003; Harper 2006; Bush et al. 2007; Huntley and Kowalewski 2007). This phenomenon is evidenced by a significant increase in drilling frequency in the GCP and Atlantic Coastal Plain (collectively known as the Coastal Plain) following the K/ Pg extinction (Kelley and Hansen 1993, 1996a,b, 2006). Striking transitions also have been documented in the morphological and ecological attributes of prey taxa, such as deeper infaunalization in bivalves during the Mesozoic (Stanley 1977; Vermeij 1977, 1994; Aberhan 1994; Aberhan et al. 2006; Bush et al.
2007) and across the K/Pg extinction (Lockwood 2004), and a decline of immobile epifauna that cannot reattach if disturbed (Vermeij 1977, 1994; Aberhan et al. 2006; Bush et al. 2007). These trends have been documented primarily at the global level, and previous local and regional studies have concentrated on the mid to late Mesozoic. Relatively few studies have tracked both the diversity and abundance structure of local assemblages through the late Mesozoic to early Cenozoic at a finer stratigraphic scale or evaluated the role habitat may have played in influencing these trends.
The aforementioned transitions lead to several questions: (1) How did mass extinction and subsequent recovery influence diversity and ecological trends? (2) What role did habitat play in mediating these trends? (3) Did local GCP diversity strongly increase during this time, paralleling ‘‘traditional’’ global diversity compilations of Sepkoski (e.g., 1993), or did local diversity instead display the more muted rise observed in newer global diversity compilations like that of Alroy (2010b)? Related to the last question is whether massive extinctions and fundamental shifts in ecology resulted in a net increase in local diversity.
Hansen (1988) and Hansen et al. (1993a,b) tracked diversity and ecological changes in latest Maastrichtian to mid -Paleocene local GCP offshore assemblages, as well as regional diversity through the Paleogene. We expand on these studies by incorporating data from the Campanian through the early Eocene at the local scale, and by evaluating the role of habitat on diversity and ecological trends by studying assemblages from offshore and shallow subtidal settings. Additionally, we use sample-standardization techniques and cull our data to mitigate for newly recognized biases, such as lithification (e.g., Hendy 2009; Sessa et al. 2009).
K/Pg Mass Extinction and the Gulf Coastal Plain.—The K/Pg extinction was characterized by the loss of ,50% of marine genera globally (Sepkoski 1998; Alroy et al. 2008) and an estimated 70% of species (Jablonski and Chaloner 1994). In the standardized global diversity compilations of Alroy et al.

(2008) and Alroy (2010a,b), diversity decrease and recovery are not visible within the resolution of the 10-Myr sample bins used; instead, the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene appear equally diverse, indicating that global diversity rebounded in less than 10 Myr (Alroy et al. 2008; Alroy 2010a,b). Using GCP collections, Hansen et al. (1993a,b) found that the diversity rebound of local offshore assemblages was also rapid, occurring in ,2 Myr.
The GCP has been the site of several important K/Pg extinction and recovery studies because of its generally good fossil preservation and relatively complete stratigraphic sections (see Hansen et al. 2004 for a review). Harries (1999) compiled a global data set of Cretaceous and Cenozoic taxa, and determined that 91% of taxa living in the GCP became extinct globally at the K/Pg boundary. Latest Cretaceous GCP assemblages were dominated by suspension feeders; during the first 0.5 Myr after the event, deposit-feeding transiently became the main feeding mode (Hansen 1988, 1993a). Early Paleocene settings were repopulated largely by species descended from Cretaceous genera (Hansen 1988; Hansen et al. 1993a,b; Harries 1999). Because so many GCP taxa went extinct at the K/Pg boundary, it is difficult to ascertain any extinction selectivity within the region (Hansen et al. 1993b, 2004; Harries 1999). Many other studies have found little evidence for selectivity among marine invertebrates during the K/Pg extinction for a variety of traits, including habitat preference (Jablonski and Raup 1995), abundance (Lockwood 2003), degree of escalation (i.e., possessing traits indicative of predator avoidance) (Hansen et al. 1999; Lockwood 2005), physiological level of activity (Bambach et al. 2002), and physiological buffering (Bambach et al. 2002). There may be some selectivity in that southern high latitude faunas appear to suffer a lower extinction rate than those of the Northern Hemisphere (Zinsmeister et al. 1989; Stilwell 2003), and planktotrophic taxa may have had a higher extinction rate than those with a nonplanktotrophic larval stage (Gallagher 1991; Aberhan et al. 2007).
Data
We compiled a large fossil database from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas from our own fieldwork and the literature (Table 1; Supplementary Appendix). The database includes only bivalves, gastropods, and scaphopods because other taxa (e.g., solitary corals, bryozoans) are often identified only in broad taxonomic categories or are not consistently recorded. Ammonites and pteropod gastropods were excluded because they were not part of the benthic community.
Campanian and Maastrichtian (84–65.5 Ma) data, resulting largely from the efforts of Sohl and Koch (1983, 1984, 1987), were divided into four time bins with durations ranging from 1.1 to 7.1 Myr (average duration of 3 Myr; Table 1). Early Paleogene (Paleocene through early Eocene; 65.5–46.6 Ma) samples come from field collections and literature sources, and were placed into eight time bins with durations ranging from 0.6 to 6 Myr (mean duration of 2.4 Myr; Table 1). The binning scheme is the finest possible given the non-uniform occurrence of fossiliferous strata in the GCP, the resolution available from biostratigraphic time control, and the need to amalgamate individual units into bins containing enough data for analysis. All unculled collections can be accessed from the Paleobiology Database (http://paleodb.org) by searching for reference number 29915.
Bulk samples were culled in an attempt to help mitigate variability in collection methods, preservation, and environmental setting. We excluded 202 lithified and poorly lithified samples (168 from the Late Cretaceous and 34 from the early Paleogene) because lithification selectively removes small individuals (Hendy 2009; Sessa et al. 2009). Shallow subtidal and offshore environments can be sampled across the K/Pg boundary, and the data set is constrained to samples from these habitats. Primarily siliciclastic, clay-rich lithologies contain microfossils representative of middle to outer shelf environments, which we term ‘‘offshore’’ (Jiang and Gartner 1986; Mancini and Tew 1995; D’Agostino and Yancey 1996), whereas mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sand and marl lithologies represent a shallow

  subtidal, inner shelf environment (Gibson et al. 1982; Mancini and Tew 1995). The culled shallow subtidal data set has 94 samples containing over 40,000 individuals, and the culled offshore data set consists of 77 samples with nearly 13,800 individuals. Note that time bin duration varies and that bin spacing is uneven (Table 1), but this will not affect the interpretation of local diversity trends that are based on ‘‘point estimates’’ in time and space, rather than time bin aggregates. This uneven spacing, however, prevents us from evaluating the aftermath of the K/Pg extinction in the shallow subtidal environment, because unlithified samples are not known from this interval and setting (see also Sessa et al. 2009). Likewise, there are no fossiliferous offshore samples known beyond 61.4 Ma within the study interval.
Most of the data used in this compilation (including our own) were collected to answer paleoecologic questions, and thus the collection and processing methods used by different researchers are comparable. With the possible exceptions of samples from Toulmin (1977) and Sohl and Koch (1983, 1984, 1987) who do not report collection methods, samples are based on a bulk collection of individuals from a constrained area of a fossiliferous bed at an outcrop, sieved and counted using similar metrics. A comparison
of the taxonomic lists and diversity values generated from several localities studied by Toulmin, ourselves, and other GCP workers yielded similar results for each locality regardless of worker, indicating that Toulmin’s techniques were not widely divergent from those of other authors (results not shown). Kosnik (2005) sieved bulk sediment using a 1-mm sieve; following several other authors, we used a 2-mm sieve (the sieve sizes used by Toulmin [1977] and Sohl and Koch [1983, 1984, 1987] are unknown). To compare the faunal lists of Kosnik (2005) with those collected by ourselves and others, we use revised species lists based on individual fossils 2 mm and larger (M. Kosnik personal communication 2009).
Methods
Diversity Metrics.—The term ‘‘diversity’’ is often used to indicate the number of taxa within a given sample (i.e., richness), but it can also refer to a metric incorporating both the number of taxa and the relative abundance structure of those taxa within a sample. Hence, we use the term ‘‘richness’’ to refer solely to the number of taxa, ‘‘evenness’’ to reflect relative abundance structure, and ‘‘diversity’’ to signify both. We used diversity statistics common in ecologic and paleoecologic

studies, including the number of taxa, called taxonomic richness; H9, an entropy-based diversity metric that incorporates both richness and evenness (Hayek and Buzas 1997); and PIE (Probability of Interspecific Encounter, Hurlbert 1971).
Use of a subsampling routine enabled the standardized comparisons of local (i.e., sample level) values through time. The data set was first split by environment, and samples with fewer than a specified quota of individuals (typically, 100) were excluded. Samples were then subsampled with replacement (i.e., bootstrapped) to that quota 1000 times (see Supplementary Appendix for subsampling rationale and details). The ecological affinities of each individual drawn during subsampling were tallied, so that the richness and abundance of ecological modes of life were subsampled in the same fashion as diversity metrics. Subsample distributions were pooled for each time bin, producing estimates of the mean and variance of various metrics for each time bin. Analyses were run with quotas of 70, 100, 200, and 500 individuals to assess the sensitivity of results to sample size. We did not perform additional standardization procedures, such as subsampling by list, because some time bins contained too few lists (Table 1). Subsampling routines were performed using code written in the language R (R Development Core Team 2010).
Assessing Temporal Trends.—The goals of this study are to determine whether there were secular trends in the diversity and ecological composition of late Cretaceous through early Paleogene local assemblages, and whether these trends were affected either by the K/Pg extinction or by environmental setting. To evaluate these questions, we utilize analyses that were developed to examine evolutionary change in the morphologic traits of lineages through time (Hunt 2006, 2008). These analyses are broadly applicable to the general question of assessing change through time (see Kosnik et al. 2011 for an example of using times-series modeling to examine trends in the durability of shells of various taxa through the Phanerozoic). Here, we use time-series analysis to evaluate the dynamics of the mean value of a particular
diversity metric or ecological trait through time. Analyses were performed using the PaleoTS package version 0.4–1 for R (Hunt 2011) with slight modifications to PaleoTS functions described below and in the Supplementary Appendix.
Several models are fit to the data and evaluated to determine which are the best supported. The simplest models are those that assume homogeneous dynamics of the mean value of a particular trait over the entire study interval: stasis, the unbiased random walk, and the biased random walk (models 1–3, respectively, in Fig. 1). The prediction of a biased random walk follows from studies indicating a progressive increase in diversity (e.g., Sepkoski 1993) or certain ecological traits (e.g., Vermeij 1977, 1994) through the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, whereas stasis and an unbiased random walk could both be expected from previous work indicating little progressive change during this time (e.g., Madin et al. 2006; Alroy et al. 2008; Alroy 2010b), although these studies were not explicitly formulated in this way. Note that although both an unbiased random walk and stasis are used to express a lack of a directed trend, they are distinct concepts. In a model of stasis, a particular value is maintained, with no accumulation of change through time, and therefore the time elapsed since the beginning of the time series is irrelevant (Hunt 2006). In contrast, in an unbiased random walk, the mean value of a trait varies through time, but there is no net directionality to this change (Hunt 2006).
Heterogeneous models, or those that postulate that dynamics were interrupted by a shift or punctuation (Hunt 2008), are used to evaluate whether the K/Pg extinction changed the diversity and ecological structure of Paleogene assemblages relative to those of the Late Cretaceous. An instantaneous (i.e., unsampled; Hunt 2008) punctuation was set between the latest Cretaceous and earliest Paleocene bins, dividing the time series into two segments that were each modeled separately.
Although it is perhaps obvious that the K/ Pg extinction had an effect on the overall richness of assemblages, it is less evident that

                                                                                               FIGURE 1. Examples of seven candidate models of diversity and ecological trends through time, with a hypothetical trait (y-axis) plotted through time (x-axis). The top three examples (stasis, unbiased random walk, and biased random walk) postulate no shift in dynamics through time, while the bottom four (biased random walk followed by a biased random walk, unbiased random walk followed by a biased random walk, stasis followed by a biased random walk, and stasis followed by an unbiased random walk) incorporate an instantaneous shift representing the K/Pg extinction (denoted by the thin vertical line) halfway through the time series. See text for additional explanation of these models.
this event also altered the dynamics that governed the ecological composition of assemblages. Some (e.g., Vermeij 2004, 2008) have argued that extinction events do little to alter the long-term trajectory of ecological trends through time, except to temporarily draw down the number of species. This hypothesis is modeled by a biased random walk followed by a punctuation and then another biased random walk (model 4 in Fig. 1). Others have suggested that the proportions of mobile taxa,
predators, and epifaunal taxa were relatively stable throughout most of the Mesozoic and then displayed directional changes during the recovery interval following the K/Pg mass extinction (e.g., Bambach et al. 2002). Models that propose an unbiased random walk or stasis, a punctuation, and then a biased random walk (models 5 and 6, respectively, in Fig. 1) are derived from these studies. A variant of this hypothesis, stasis followed by a shift and then an unbiased random walk, is included as a more general model that postulates non-directional change following the K/Pg extinction (model 7 in Fig. 1). Although there are additional combinations of model dynamics that could be run (e.g., a biased random walk followed by stasis) models should be based on a priori hypotheses, and not used for explorative purposes (Hunt 2008).
PaleoTS uses the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or, as in this case, the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) to discriminate among the fits of the seven models employed in this study. The AICc can be thought of as a compromise between the goodness-of-fit of a particular model and the complexity, or the number of parameters, of that model (Hunt 2008). Models with low AICc scores are preferred over those with high values. The AICc values are summarized by Akaike weights, which represent the relative model ranks and sum to one.
Because PaleoTS was developed to model morphological changes through time, the data input into PaleoTS are, for each time bin, (1) mean measurements, (2) sample variances, (3) sample size, and (4) time bin age. In our context, mean measurements and sample variances are the average and the variance of a particular diversity metric, or the average and the variance of the richness or abundance of an ecologic trait, obtained through the subsampling routine described above and applied to the subdivided data sets (discussed below). Sample sizes are set to one so that the amount of sampling error is calculated properly from the variance among the subsampled replicates (G. Hunt personal communication 2011). The ancestor-descendant function was used to fit models (Hunt 2006).

Each habitat contains only a few time bins (six for the offshore setting, eight for the shallow subtidal habitat), making it unlikely that time-series analysis would support any model over the simplest model of an unbiased random walk. This is because the additional parameters required to describe those dynamics would result in higher AICc scores for those models, as the parsimony component of AICc strongly penalizes complex models that have few time bins (Hunt 2008). This is particularly the case for those models that divide the time series into preand post-extinction segments, thus requiring additional parameters, and Hunt (2008) suggests a minimum of five bins per segment. We have thus subdivided the data into 22 bins for the offshore setting (six Late Cretaceous bins and 16 Paleocene bins) and 14 bins for the shallow subtidal setting (eight Late Cretaceous bins and six Paleogene bins), which, while displaying more volatile patterns than the original data set, nonetheless display the same trends. Even with subdividing, however, these time series are still short when divided into preand post-extinction segments. Additionally, the subdivided time bins are composed of one or a few samples, making them subject to random fluctuations in the proportions of taxa and thus various ecologic categories. Because of these caveats, we focus on general patterns recovered by the models and on similarities with the subsampling results.
Ecological Classification.—Diversity analyses are complemented by an evaluation of how ecological modes of life, or guilds, evolved during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene using the ecospace method of Bush et al. (2007). Taxa are classified with respect to three variables: tiering, mobility, and feeding mechanism. Each of these represents an axis in the ‘‘theoretical ecospace’’ scheme of Bush et al. (2007), the specific categories of which have been modified for this study (Table 2). Tiering describes where the animal lives relative to the sediment/water interface. Mobility categorizes the ability of an organism to move under its own power and whether it is attached to a substrate or is free living. Feeding mechanism refers to the way food is acquired by an organism. Diet is incorporated into some feeding categories (e.g., predatory carnivores,
which hunt and capture mobile prey, versus browsing carnivores, which feed on sedentary/ immobile, and typically colonial, prey). An advantage of the Bush et al. (2007) ecospace method is that individual aspects of life mode can be evaluated separately (e.g., tiering) or in combination with another life mode category (e.g., tiering plus feeding) or with all three aspects (tiering, feeding, and mobility). We used a variety of combinations of life mode categories to elucidate patterns within the data set.
Extinct taxa can be assigned to specific modes of life by comparison with modern relatives and analogs. This study has the added advantage that many Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene genera or their close relatives are extant and their ecologies have been observed. The database of Neogene marine biota of tropical America (NMITA; http://eusmilia.geology.uiowa.edu/nmita.htm), which contains ecological classifications of an extensive number of extant bivalve and gastropod genera, was the primary source for categorizing taxa; the PaleoDB provided an additional source (Supplementary Appendix). Out of 1232 species, only 31 species in 19 genera could not be assigned to ecospace groups, representing less than 2% of the total individuals within the culled data set. The uncertain systematic assignment of the Ampullospiridae within the Naticidae affects whether species in the genera Gyrodes and Lacunaria are regarded as predatory carnivores (if they are true naticids) or as grazers (see discussion in Kosnik 2005). Because these species are rare, however, their categorization does not affect the results described herein.
Standardized richness and abundance of ecological categories were derived from the subsampling method described above by keeping track of the ecological designations of the individuals drawn during subsampling. For one analysis, we calculated the proportion (rather than actual number) of individuals in each mobility category of suspension feeders living at the sedimentwater interface relative to the total abundance of suspension feeders at this tier, because the abundance and richness of suspension feeders vary through time. Mobility categories were combined (swimmers plus creepers,

Means of subsampled species richness (A, D), H9 (B, E), and PIE (C, F) for local offshore (A–C) and shallow subtidal (D–F) assemblages at 100 individuals. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Vertical line denotes the K/Pg boundary; Cret. 5 Cretaceous. There is a distinct drop in richness, H9, and evenness following the K/Pg extinction in the offshore facies (A–C). In this environment, metrics rebound to pre-extinction values ,2.7 Myr after the event (A–C). Diversity, H9, and evenness remain relatively constant over 30 million years in the shallow subtidal setting (D–F); because of a lack of unlithified fossiliferous shallow subtidal deposits in the early Paleocene, a presumed drop in diversity after the extinction is not recorded in this facies.

Results
Effects of Varying Subsampling Quota.—A comparison of richness at sample sizes of 70, 100, 200, and 500 individuals indicates that despite varying sample size, all curves in each environment show essentially the same longterm trends (Supplementary Figure 3). Other diversity and ecological metrics yield similar results with respect to sample size (results not shown). Therefore, we present results from the 100 individual trials.
Diversity Patterns
Offshore.—Local subsampled mean species richness, henceforth called local richness,
increased in the latest Cretaceous, as did H9, whereas PIE was similar (Fig. 2A–C). All metrics plummeted across the K/Pg boundary (Fig. 2A–C). Local richness was reduced by 75% across the boundary and all metrics recovered to pre-extinction levels within 2.7 Myr (Fig. 2A–C). Diversity metrics were relatively stable for the last two bins of the study (Fig. 2A–C). Diversity metrics are best represented by a model of stasis followed by a punctuation (i.e., the K/Pg boundary) and then an unbiased random walk, although there is some support for a biased random walk following the extinction (‘‘Richness’’ column in Table 3; model fits for additional diversity metrics are not shown because they are very similar to the richness results).
Shallow Subtidal.—All diversity metrics in the shallow subtidal facies were relatively constant through the Late Cretaceous, with the exception of a moderate rise in richness

Ecology
Feeding; Offshore.—Suspension feeding was the most abundant feeding type in the Late Cretaceous (Fig. 3A,B), and included several bivalve clades. Late Cretaceous predatory carnivores were predominantly cuspidarid and poromyid bivalves, followed by neogastropods. Predatory carnivores were rare in both richness (,2 species) (Fig. 3A) and abundance (,4%) (Fig. 3B). Following the K/Pg extinction, deposit feeder abundance temporarily increased (Fig. 3B) (Hansen et al. 1993a). Suspension feeders never regained their former abundance or richness during the study interval (Fig. 3A,B) (Hansen et al. 1993a). Predatory carnivores radiated to ,10
species and increased in abundance through the early Paleocene to ,25% of the total biota (Fig. 3A,B), driven by the expansion of several neogastropod families.
Feeding; Shallow Subtidal.—In contrast to offshore assemblages, shallow subtidal faunas show almost no significant changes in feeding types through ,20 Myr of the Late Cretaceous or across the K/Pg extinction. The abundance and richness of predatory carnivores in the Late Cretaceous shallow subtidal was higher than that of contemporaneous offshore assemblages (compare Fig. 3A,B with 3C,D). The last bin, 49.6 Ma, contains an unusually high abundance of depositfeeding taxa and few predatory carnivores (Fig. 3C,D). There is only one sample in this bin, and the peak may therefore represent simply a site-specific assemblage. A model of stasis over the entire interval best describes the various shallow subtidal feeding categories; predator richness (‘‘Pred rich’’) and

Abbreviations and demarcations as in Figure 2. Following the extinction, there was a temporary increase in the abundance of deposit feeders at 65.2 Ma in the offshore facies (B). There were significant increases in carnivorous predator richness and abundance and significant decreases in suspension feeder richness and abundance in offshore assemblages of the early Paleogene relative to those of the Late Cretaceous (A, B). There are no significant trends in feeding categories of the shallow subtidal facies (C, D). For clarity, only the 95% confidence intervals of the suspension feeding category are plotted.
abundance (‘‘Pred abu’’) are given as examples in Table 4.
Tiering; Offshore.—The two Late Cretaceous bins exhibit similar tiering profiles, except for the greater richness of the deep infaunal tier in the youngest Cretaceous bin (Fig. 4A,B). Every tier shows a drop in the overall number of species and individuals after the K/Pg extinction, except for an increase in the abundance of organisms that occupy the deepest tier at 65.2 Ma, reflecting the temporary dominance of deep infaunal deposit feeders (Fig. 4A,B).
Feeding Mode of Organisms at the SedimentWater Interface; Offshore.—Parsing the tiering categories by feeding mode reveals that the Paleocene increase in species and individuals living at the sediment-water interface (Fig. 4A,B) resulted from the combination of
an increase of predatory carnivores and a decrease of suspension feeders (Fig. 4C,D). The richness and abundance of these two groups are all best fit by a model of stasis before the extinction and an unbiased walk following it; there is also some support for a biased random walk in the Paleocene (columns ‘‘Surf sus rich’’ through ‘‘Surf pred abu’’ in Table 3). Other tiering/feeding combinations do not show trends through time, highlighting that the sediment-water interface was a focal point for ecological restructuring across the K/Pg boundary.
Mobility of Suspension Feeders at the SedimentWater Interface; Offshore.—The decreasing richness and abundance of surficial suspension feeders across the K/Pg boundary can be further dissected by categorizing the mobility levels of these organisms. This reveals the

FIGURE 4. Means of subsampled species richness (A, C, and E) and abundance (B, D, and F) for offshore assemblages at 100 individuals. Abbreviations and demarcations as in Fig. 2. A and B display the tiering distribution of the entire fauna; C and D are subsets of A and B, respectively, showing carnivorous predators and suspension feeders living at the sediment-water interface. E and F are subsets of C and D, respectively, representing the mobility levels of suspension feeders living at the sediment-water interface. Because the overall abundance of suspension feeders varied through time (Fig. 3B), 100 suspension-feeding individuals from the sediment-water interface were subsampled from each bin and the various mobility categories of these taxa were tabulated in E and F (rather than subsampling 100 individuals regardless of ecological affinity, as in all other analyses). The richness and abundance of all tiers fell across the K/Pg extinction, except for an increase in the proportion of individuals that occupy the deepest tier at 65.2 Ma, which was driven by the transient dominance of deposit feeders (Fig. 3B). The trend of more species and individuals occupying the sediment-water interface through time (A and B) was caused by the increase of surface dwelling carnivores (C and D). The decrease of surface dwelling suspension feeders following the K/Pg boundary (C and D) reflects a significant decrease in the proportion of immobile organisms in this guild (E and F). Other tiering, feeding, and mobility combinations do not show significant changes, and hence are not shown here. For clarity, only the 95% confidence intervals of the deep infaunal tier are plotted in A and B, and only those of the highly mobile category are plotted in E and F.
replacement of immobile suspension feeders, such as oysters, by more active surficial suspension feeders, such as veneroid bivalves (Fig. 4E,F). Note that whereas all other analyses are based on subsampling 100 individuals, because the abundance of suspension feeders varied through time (Fig. 3A,B) we subsampled 100 suspension-feeding individuals from the sediment-water interface and calculated the proportion of the various mobility categories (Fig. 4E,F). An unbiased random walk is the model that best fits the
richness of the most active surficial suspension feeders (column ‘‘Surf sus fast rich’’ in Table 3), likely because these individuals are relatively rare. An unbiased random walk also best fits the abundance of this same guild, but also supported is a model of an unbiased random walk followed by a biased random walk (note the close AICc values of these models [2 and 5] in column ‘‘Surf sus fast abu’’ in Table 3). Facultative and immobile surficial suspension feeders are best modeled by stasis followed by an unbiased

Abbreviations and demarcations as in Figure 2. The ‘‘immobile’’ and ‘‘facultatively mobile’’ categories both contain attached and unattached organisms; the ‘‘highly mobile’’ category contains creepers and swimmers. There were significant reductions in the richness and abundance of immobile organisms, and significant increases in the richness and abundance of highly mobile organisms, following the K/Pg extinction in the offshore facies.

random walk (columns ‘‘Surf sus fac rich’’ through ‘‘Surf sus imm abu’’ in Table 3).
Tiering; Shallow Subtidal.—No significant changes are observed in tiering throughout the study interval (results not shown), and stasis is the most supported model for various tiering categories (e.g., ‘‘Surf rich’’ and ‘‘Surf abu’’ columns in Table 4).
Mobility of the Entire Fauna; Offshore.—There are no significant changes in the richness or abundance of any mobility category during the Late Cretaceous. Late Cretaceous assemblages contained ,20% highly mobile taxa (swimming and creeping taxa) and ,80% facultatively mobile and immobile taxa. The oldest Paleocene bin (65.2 Ma) was almost completely dominated (,92%) by creeping taxa (Fig. 5B), reflecting the extinction of immobile suspension feeders (Fig. 4E,F) and the temporary dominance of highly mobile deposit feeders (Fig. 3B). Early Paleocene assemblages contained ,70% highly mobile
individuals (Fig. 5B), propelled by the increase in highly mobile predatory gastropods (Figs. 3B, 4D) and by the replacement of immobile suspension feeders by mobile ones (Fig. 4F). Both the richness and abundance of the most active category are best fit by an unbiased random walk model, although the AICc value of stasis followed by an unbiased random walk is somewhat close to that of the unbiased random walk for abundance (columns ‘‘Fast mob rich’’ and ‘‘Fast mob abu’’ in Table 3). The richness and abundance of facultative and immobile organisms are best modeled by stasis followed by an unbiased random walk, with a biased random walk after the K/Pg extinction also receiving some support in certain cases (columns ‘‘Fac mob rich’’ through ‘‘Imm abu’’ in Table 3). In the biased random walk models, the richness and abundance of immobile taxa decline following the K/Pg extinction; indeed, immobile taxa are absent from many of these samples.

  Mobility of the Entire Fauna; Shallow Subtidal.—The shallow subtidal environment of the Late Cretaceous was dominated by creeping and facultatively mobile organisms (Fig. 5C,D). The abundance and richness of all mobility categories are best fit by a model of stasis, except for the richness of facultatively mobile taxa, which is best modeled by stasis followed by an unbiased random walk (columns ‘‘Fast mob rich’’ through ‘‘Imm abu’’ in Table 4).
Which Taxonomic Groups Drove the Major Changes in Ecological Structure?
In the following discussion, faunas from the recovery interval are excluded because they represent a transient assemblage distinct from faunas of both the Late Cretaceous and the early Paleogene (Hansen 1988). In general, the Paleocene radiations of ecological groups were associated with the diversification of taxa uncommon in offshore settings of the Late Cretaceous. The most abundant predatory carnivores offshore in the Late Cretaceous were the cuspidarid and poromyid bivalves, followed by a variety of neogastropod families that were rare (Table 5). In the Paleocene, predatory bivalves were rare. The abundance and number of neogastropods within collections increased dramatically in the Paleocene, paralleling a trend documented globally, in the Coastal Plain, and elsewhere (Vermeij 1977, 1987; Kelley and Hansen 1993; Jablonski 1998;
Kowalewski et al. 1998; Bambach 2002; Stillwell 2003; Bush et al. 2007). In particular, the volutid and turrid neogastropods, which were rare offshore in the Late Cretaceous, contributed substantially to this radiation.
Attached, immobile suspension feeders at the sediment-water interface dominated offshore in the Late Cretaceous and were primarily composed of the bivalve superfamily Ostreoidea (e.g., gryphaeids and ostreids) and the order Pectinoida (Table 5). The abundance and number of species and individuals occupying this guild were reduced dramatically in Paleocene offshore assemblages, as were the richness and abundance of ostreoids and pectinoids. They were replaced by more active suspension feeders at the sediment-water interface, such as turritellid gastropods, which were uncommon offshore in the Late Cretaceous (Table 5).
In contrast to patterns displayed in the offshore, the ecologic composition of shallow subtidal assemblages remained essentially unchanged through the early Paleogene, and the taxonomic groups making up the various guilds do not vary significantly through time (Table 5). Kosnik (2005) compared Campanian, Maastrichtian, and late middle Eocene GCP shallow subtidal assemblages and observed the same pattern of relatively stable ecological structure as in this study, indicating that the ecological composition of shallow subtidal assemblages remained largely unchanged for at least 45 Myr.

Discussion
Trends in Local Diversity during the Late Cretaceous through Early Paleogene.—Local diversity metrics were fairly constant during the last 20 Myr of the Cretaceous, except for a diversity spike in both settings during the late Maastrichtian (Fig. 2), the cause of which is unclear. Like Hansen and colleagues (Hansen 1998; Hansen et al. 1993a,b), we found that the local richness of offshore early Paleogene assemblages recovered to pre-extinction levels within 2–3 Myr following the K/Pg mass extinction (Fig. 2A–C). There are no known unlithified, shallow subtidal faunas available to study until ,7 Myr after the K/Pg extinction (Sessa et al. 2009), at which point diversity metrics are similar to those of the Late Cretaceous (Fig. 2D–F). After that, shallow subtidal diversity remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 2D–F). In neither habitat is an unbridled increase like that of older synoptic global compilations supported by our data. These results provide corroborating evidence for the view emerging from other regional and global studies that preservational and methodological biases can skew our impression of diversity at all scales (Raup 1976; Alroy et al. 2001, 2008; Peters and Foote 2001; Smith 2001; Krug and Patzkowsky 2004; Peters 2005; Crampton et al. 2006; Hendy 2009; Sessa et al. 2009; Wall et al. 2009; Alroy 2010a,b). Because this study focuses on the local signal of diversity in one region, the trends depicted here do not test directly whether global diversity increased; nonetheless, the patterns we observe appear similar to newer global diversity curves that show only a moderate rise in diversity during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic (e.g., Alroy 2010b). On the other hand, the similarity of patterns at local and global scales argues for the suggestion that global diversity ultimately is rooted in the same processes that control local and regional scales of diversity (Bambach 1977, 1993; Sepkoski 1988; Bush and Bambach 2004; Bambach et al. 2007; Bush et al. 2007; Patzkowsky and Holland 2007). Additionally, aggregate regional diversity, which certainly contributes to global diversity, was not studied here.
Ecological Restructuring Following the K/ Pg Extinction.—A striking pattern emerges when the model results from the offshore and shallow subtidal assemblages are compared. Whereas stasis over the entire study interval is by far the best model to describe the diversity and ecological patterns of shallow subtidal assemblages (Table 4), offshore faunas are largely best fit by models that include a shift at the K/Pg boundary (Table 3). Stasis followed by an unbiased random walk is generally the most supported model for the richness and ecological modes of life of offshore faunas, with stasis followed by a biased random walk and a simple unbiased random walk also receiving moderate support in some cases. The variation in statistical support for models of the offshore fauna stems in part from the volatile nature of this data set when parsed into time bins composed primarily of single samples. However, it also reflects that ecology changed dramatically following the K/Pg extinction. Because the ecology and diversity of the recovery interval are clearly distinct from the intervals that precede and follow it, adding another punctuation to separate the recovery interval from the rest of the Paleocene is warranted. For example, Late Cretaceous offshore faunas were composed of ,20% highly mobile taxa, whereas the earliest Paleocene samples were nearly completely dominated (.90%) by these taxa (Fig. 5A,B). This proportion fluctuated during the recovery interval and then stabilized at ,70% following the recovery interval (Fig. 5A,B). Because of these wide swings in the proportion of highly mobile taxa, an unbiased random walk is the most supported model; separating the recovery interval into a segment with its own dynamics may yield patterns more consistent with the rest of the data set (i.e., an effect of the K/Pg extinction on this mobility category). However, additional punctuations would further shorten each segment of the time series, and a model with these additional parameters likely would not be supported, because the AICc penalizes complex models with few time bins. Time-series modeling simulated 16 different aspects of offshore ecology; 12 are best described by models that incorporate a shift

at the K/Pg boundary. This indicates that time-series analysis supports the results found when using the binned data set, namely that the K/Pg extinction caused significant restructuring of the ecological composition of offshore assemblages.
The ecological effects of the K/Pg extinction are facies specific, with offshore faunas displaying dramatic reorganization and shallow subtidal biotas remaining relatively unchanged across the extinction, although a recovery period in shallow subtidal assemblages cannot be ruled out given the resolution of the data set. It might be tempting to attribute this difference to enhanced survivorship of shallow subtidal taxa relative to offshore taxa. However, many K/Pg extinction studies have yielded little evidence for selectivity in general, and Jablonski and Raup (1995) failed to find evidence for selectivity by habitat (but see Zinsmeister et al. 1989; Stilwell 2003 for the enhanced survival of high-latitude faunas). Additionally, the majority of taxa in the offshore data set are also found in shallow subtidal samples (albeit often at very different abundances), making selectivity by environment unlikely. A possible explanation for habitat-specific trends relates to the onshore-offshore pattern of ecological innovation, whereby the ecology of offshore assemblages from a particular time often resembles the onshore ecologies of a past time. For example, onshore assemblages of the Late Cretaceous have an ecologic makeup similar to those of today, but the ecologic composition of offshore assemblages in the Late Cretaceous resembles that of late Paleozoic–early Mesozoic onshore communities (Jablonski et al. 1983). The mechanisms behind this pattern are not clear (Jablonski et al. 1983; Jablonski and Bottjer 1991), but as Sepkoski (1991) pointed out, onshore-offshore patterns need not originate from biological interactions; trends can be driven by differential rates of origination and/or extinction in various taxa. Because differential extinction has been ruled out as generating the patterns described here, it is possible that the early Paleogene offshore was repopulated by taxa with higher rates of origination. The lack of extinction selectivity appears to be a global
phenomenon (Jablonski and Raup 1995), and thus higher rates of origination would be evidenced globally, with the GCP presumably reflecting a combination of origination and immigration. Such a hypothesis is testable by following particular clades (such as predatory gastropod families) through the extinction and recovery interval and calculating their rates of origination within an environmental framework. The relatively small size of the current data set when parsed into habitats prevents this type of analysis at present, but expansion of the data set is possible.
Following the K/Pg extinction, offshore assemblages display evidence for increased predation pressure (increased richness and abundance of carnivorous predators) and the response of taxa to this pressure (an increase of highly mobile species and individuals, and a dramatic decline in the abundance of immobile, surficial suspension feeders). These trends cannot be attributed to changing environmental conditions, because offshore data come primarily from closely arrayed localities interpreted (from sedimentology and microfossil assemblage) as recording relatively unchanging habitats from the Late Cretaceous through early Paleocene, excluding disturbed bedding associated with the K/ Pg impact (see Hansen et al. 1987, 1993a,b). This implies that biotic interactions, and specifically increased predation pressure and, possibly, escalation (enemy-driven evolution; Vermeij 1977, 1987), were key in shaping the composition and structure of local assemblages during this time. The worldwide rise of predatory gastropods during the early Cenozoic has been well documented (Stanley 1977; Vermeij 1977, 2008; Kelley and Hansen 1993; Jablonski 1998; Kowalewski et al. 1998; Bambach 2002; Stillwell 2003; Huntley and Kowalewski 2007). Direct evidence for increased predation pressure in the study area comes from Kelley and Hansen (1996a,b, 2006), who found a substantial increase in drilling frequency immediately after the K/Pg extinction and attributed this to escalation. Using a data set that contained GCP specimens, Lockwood (2004) discovered a morphologic trend in veneroid bivalves toward deeper burrowing

in the wake of the K/Pg extinction, and suggested that increased predation pressure was responsible for this trend. In addition, predation pressure is expected to be greatest at the sediment-water interface (Vermeij 1977, 1987), and this tier did indeed display the most ecological reorganization (Fig. 4). Other types of biotic interactions, such as the response of taxa to increased disturbance via bioturbation, fail to explain the increase in drilling frequency (Kelley and Hansen 1996a,b, 2006) or the deeper burrowing in veneroids (Lockwood 2004) observed in the GCP after the K/Pg extinction. Therefore, increased predation pressure, or possibly escalation, seems to be the most likely explanation for the patterns observed in our study and those of Kelley and Hansen (1996, 2006) and Lockwood (2004).
Interestingly, while Vermeij (1995, 2008) has stated that, in general, mass extinctions had only minor effects on long-term patterns of escalation, our results suggest that the K/ Pg extinction and recovery accelerated trends that began earlier in the Mesozoic. Several other studies also find evidence for an increase in escalation following the K/Pg event. The global diversity of predators increased significantly following the K/Pg extinction (Kowalewski et al. 1998; Bambach 2002; Huntley and Kowalewski 2007). Kelley and Hansen (1993, 1996a,b, 2006) found that the intensity of drilling frequency increased dramatically in the Coastal Plain following the extinction. Aberhan et al. (2007) documented a significant increase in mobile taxa in local Argentinean molluscan faunas across the K/Pg event. Thus, it seems likely that the K/Pg mass extinction did indeed have a significant effect on escalatory trends.
Additional Controls on Diversity and Ecology.—The rapid rate of diversity recovery in the context of static diversity levels prior to and following the K/Pg extinction and recovery suggests the importance of incumbency, or the constraints that existing organisms impose on the potential survival of evolving or invading species (Valentine 1980; Rosenzweig and McCord 1991; Bambach et al. 2002; Alroy 2008). The removal of incumbents is thought to have caused a temporary increase in speciation rate following a variety of
Phanerozoic mass extinctions (Miller and Sepkoski 1988; Jablonski and Sepkoski 1996; Bambach et al. 2002; discussion in Patzkowsky and Holland 2007; Alroy 2010a) and many smaller-scale events. Recent molecular work documented a dramatic rise in the speciation rates of several unrelated taxa following the colonization of previously unoccupied territory after geographic barriers were removed (Williams and Duda 2008), in a manner analogous to repopulation after an extinction. This speciation burst was temporary, and is assumed to have declined as ecologic and geographic niches were filled (Williams and Duda 2008). The rapid recovery of diversity and leveling off at near pre-extinction levels supports the idea that incumbency controlled the diversity of local faunas.
The preceding discussion raises the issue of exactly how escalation occurs, in the wake of a mass extinction or during other times. Documented cases of gradual escalation in the fossil record are scarce (see summary in Jablonski 2008), particularly at the faunal level (Kelley and Hansen 2001). Kelley and Hansen (1996b, 2001) proposed that escalation was episodic in the Coastal Plain, with escalatory increases occurring in the wake of extinctions. Indeed, models that propose simple directional trends are among the least supported for ecological modes of life (models 3 and 4 in Table 3). The implication is that physical disturbance (i.e., bolide impact at the K/Pg boundary), and by extension, removal of incumbents, was necessary for escalation to occur. This highlights the importance of both biotic and abiotic controls and argues against single-cause explanations (Miller 1998; Jablonski 2008; Alroy 2010a). We also stress the view, advocated by Jablonski (2008) and others, that theoretical and modeling approaches are necessary to parse out how these multiple influences affect communities.

bound to pre-extinction levels, within a few million years.
Except for the extinction and recovery interval, Late Cretaceous local diversities are generally similar to those of the early Paleogene. These results support previous studies suggesting only a moderate local and global diversity increase during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, rather than a strong rise.
Significant ecological reorganization occurred only in the wake of the K/Pg extinction.
Incumbency is a substantial factor in regulating the pace of diversification, the limits of local diversity, and the ecological composition of assemblages.
The taxonomic and ecological effects of the K/Pg extinction are habitat specific, with offshore assemblages displaying an increase in predators and a concomitant decline in sessile surficial suspension feeders in the wake of the K/Pg extinction, whereas the ecologic structure of shallow subtidal assemblages remained relatively unchanged through time. Lumping together data from different habitats will obscure these patterns. Extinction selectivity by habitat cannot explain this difference, which instead appears to relate to onshore-offshore patterns of ecological innovation.
Increased richness and abundance of carnivorous predators, overall increased mobility of assemblages, and replacement of immobile, surficial suspension feeders by more active suspension feeders support predation pressure as being a significant control on the composition and structure of local assemblages. These results are consistent with a wide variety of studies, performed in the GCP and elsewhere, indicating that increasing predation pressure during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic was responsible for many macroevolutionary trends.
