Abstract
Tsetse flies of the palpalis group are major vectors of Human African Trypanosomiasis in Africa. Accurate knowledge of species identity is essential for vector control. Here, we combine ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (COI) and microsatellites to determine the population structure and phylogenetic relations of Glossina p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea. CO1 sequence data suggest that G. p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea is a distinct subspecies from previously described G. p. palpalis in West Africa and Democratic Republic of Congo. Glossina p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea and DRC share a common ancestor which diverged from West African G. p. palpalis around 1.9 Ma. Previous ITS1 length polymorphism data suggested the possible presence of hybrids in Equatorial Guinea. However, ITS1 showed incomplete lineage sorting compared with clearly defined COI groups, and data from 12 unlinked microsatellites provided no evidence of hybridization. Microsatellite data indicated moderate but significant differentiation between the populations analysed (Rio Campo, Mbini and Kogo). Moreover, unlike previous studies of G. p. palpalis, there was no evidence for heterozygote deficiency, presence of migrants or cryptic population structure. Variance effective population size at Rio Campo was estimated at 501–731 assuming eight generations per year. This study of the population genetics of G. p. palpalis in central Africa provides the first estimate of genetic differentiation between geographically separated G. p. palpalis populations.

Tsetse flies of the Glossina palpalis group are major vectors of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in subSaharan Africa. Allopatric speciation in times of habitat contraction is thought to have driven the speciation of many of the existing tsetse species. Within the taxon G. palpalis s.l. there are two subspecies, G. p. palpalis

and G. p. gambiensis, which show high levels of mitochondrial sequence divergence and postzygotic isolation, with F1 males of intersubspecific crosses being sterile (Gooding 1997). The subspecies are almost entirely allopatric, with G. p. palpalis having a more southerly distribution. Challier et al. (1983) proposed that the subspecies diverged from an ancestral palpalis species following the contraction of their riverine forest habitat during a dry period at the last glacial maximum around 19 000–13 000 years ago. Mating experiments between colonies of G. p. palpalis originating in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) yielded sterile F1 hybrid males, suggesting that G. p. palpalis itself may consist of more than one subspecies (Gooding et al. 2004). A molecular phylogenetic study of the palpalis group tsetse produced results consistent with this hypothesis, as G. p. palpalis from DRC and West Africa had divergent Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (CO1) gene sequences and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) lengths (Dyer et al. 2008).
Intriguingly, G. p. palpalis from Equatorial Guinea can have ITS1 length polymorphism, containing copies of ITS1 of the same size as both West African and DRC flies, suggesting the possible presence of hybrids in this population (Dyer et al. 2008). Intraspecific and intraindividual length polymorphism due to insertions and deletions of large sections or microsatellites in ITS1 has been observed in many other insects including tiger beetles (Cicindela dorsalis), anopheline mosquitoes and black flies (Simuliidae) (Paskewitz et al. 1993; Vogler & DeSalle 1994; Tang et al. 1996). The tandem repeats of the ribosomal DNA region are homogenized by concerted evolution, a process of molecular drive involving gene conversion events and unequal crossing over, although this process is less effective between arrays located on different chromosomes (Dover 1982; Ohta & Dover 1984; Schlotterer & Tautz 1994; Vogler & DeSalle 1994). The frequent observation of heterogeneous ITS1 copies in individuals from complexes of sibling species suggests that interbreeding might partially counteract the homogenizing effects of concerted evolution, allowing the introduction of new ITS1 alleles into species (Tang et al. 1996).
Vector control is central to the control of HAT, especially the rhodesiense form, as there is no vaccine and treatment of late stages of the disease can be problematic. Vector control measures include the use of insecticide-treated traps, screens or cattle, aerial sequential spraying with pyrethroids and sterile insect releases. The dispersal capacity of an insect vector species is a key factor for vector control strategies as it determines the extent to which vector control measures need to be implemented, and the spread of genes of interest, such as insecticide resistance genes. In combination
with geographical information, population genetics can define migration rates of reproducing migrants and barriers to tsetse movement. For example, the elimination of G. p. gambiensis from the Loos islands, Guinea was predicated on molecular data (Camara et al. 2006; Solano et al. 2009). There was a high level of genetic differentiation from the mainland (30 km distant), suggesting that reproducing immigrants are extremely rare. Thus, repopulation of the islands from the mainland was deemed unlikely. Whether isolated tsetse populations exist in mainland Africa is less clear. In Coˆte d’Ivoire G. p. gambiensis populations showed evidence for isolation by distance (IBD) along a 216-km stretch of the Mouhoun River suggesting that habitat fragmentation via destruction of gallery forests limits distribution and gene flow (Bouyer et al. 2007b). The levels of differentiation are far lower than in the island vs. mainland difference in Guinea, reflecting either recent population fragmentation (that has not yet dissipated IBD) or less complete separation of the populations (that maintains IBD). Populations of the palpalis group species Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, are highly differentiated north and south of Lake Kyoga in Uganda, but show low levels of differentiation within northern or southern populations up to 125 km apart but not separated by the lake. This suggests that Lake Kyoga may form an ecological barrier to genetic exchange between Ugandan G. f. fuscipes populations (Abila et al. 2008).
In Equatorial Guinea HAT is endemic, with four known foci (WHO 2006), although, in the Bioko island focus, trypanosomiasis has not been detected since 1995, following a sustained control campaign (Simarro et al. 2006). In continental Equatorial Guinea, there are three active foci: Rio Campo in the north; Mbini in the centre and Kogo in the south. Rio Campo is at the mouth of the river Ntem, at the northern border with Cameroon. Mbini is drained by the river Wele and tributaries, and Kogo is drained by several rivers which converge at the Muni estuary. Since 2002 a combination of monopyramidal traps and deltamethrin-impregnated screens have been used to control tsetse flies in Mbini and Kogo together with concomitant surveys of Glossina distribution to monitor the impact of the control measures (Cano et al. 2007a, b). The area around Rio Campo is described by Simo et al. (2008) as ‘a mix of equatorial rainforest with farmland, marshes and swampy areas along the coast’. Glossina p. palpalis is the most common species (67.2% of tsetse caught), with G. pallicera, G. caliginea and G. nigrofusca also present (Simo et al. 2008). Glossina p. palpalis is considered the most important HAT vector species in Equatorial Guinea. Little data are available on the vector status of G. caliginea, which has a limited distribution in the coastal mangroves and forests of western Ghana to the Congo,

although it has also been reported to bite humans and to transmit T. b. brucei and T. congolense, agents of Animal African Trypanosomiasis (Nash 1969; Fraga de Azevedo 1970; Gouteux et al. 1987).
The aim of this study was to investigate the taxonomic status of G. palpalis from Equatorial Guinea and DRC with respect to West African G. p. palpalis. We tested the hypothesis that ITS1 length polymorphism in Equatorial Guinea was due to hybridization using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. Samples were analysed from the three mainland foci, spanning the country from north to south, as this more extensive sample might reveal a previously overlooked population structure. Microsatellite data provided a first glimpse of the population structure of this previously uncharacterized G. palpalis subspecies in Equatorial Guinea, and an estimate of the variance effective population size of the northern (Rio Campo) population. ITS1 and COI were also genotyped for G. caliginea; the first molecular data available for this species.
Materials and methods
Sample collection
Tsetse fly collections in Equatorial Guinea were carried out between December 2002 and July 2005 (Fig. 1) using monopyramidal traps (Gouteux & Lancien 1986). Samples from Rio Campo (2003), Rio Campo (2005) and Mbini (2005) were preserved dried in individual tubes filled with silica gel. Samples from Kogo (2002) were preserved in 80% ethanol. Specimens identified as G. palpalis palpalis were shipped to Lisbon, where morphological identification was checked for a subsample of flies based on the morphological keys of Pollock (1982) and Brunhes et al. (1994). Other collections of G. p. palpalis and G. p, gambiensis, G. fuscipes, G. tachinoides, G. pallicera and G. m. morsitans, that were used to infer phylogenetic relationships, have been described previ-
ously (Dyer et al. 2008; Solano et al. 2009). Glossina p. gambiensis specimens from Senegal were collected from June to July 2007.
DNA was extracted from individual flies using either a boiling ⁄ phenol–chloroform (Ferreira et al. 2008) or a Chelex method (Solano et al. 2000). To avoid microsatellite hemizygotes on the X chromosome, and amplification of Y chromosomal rDNA, only female samples were used for DNA extraction and subsequent analysis.
Microsatellite genotyping
Twelve microsatellites with dinucleotide (Pgp13, Pgp17, Pgp35, Pgp8, Pgp22, Pgp11, Pgp28 and Pgp1) (Luna et al. 2001), Gmm8 (Baker & Krafsur 2001) or trinucleotide repeats (GmsCAG02, GpCAG133 and GmsCAG29B) (Baker & Krafsur 2001) were amplified using published primers (primers and conditions are shown in Table S1). Loci Pgp11 and Pgp13 are on the X chromosome in G. p. gambiensis (Bouyer et al. 2007b). Microsatellite genotyping was performed using PCR using fluorescently labelled forward primers (6-FAM, HEX and NED). Reactions took place in a 20-lL PCR mix containing 1· PCR buffer (Promega) 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 lM of an equimolar mixture of dNTPs, 125–500 nM of each forward and reverse primer, 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase and 1 lL of a 1:10 dilution of DNA from stock. Cycling conditions included an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles each with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50–56 °C (locus dependent) for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. Amplified fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis in an automatic sequencer (ABI 3730, Applied Biosystems). Fragment sizes were scored using the software GeneMarker (SoftGenetics, USA). PCR and electrophoresis of all negative and ambiguous genotypes were repeated once.

Microsatellite analysis
Linkage disequilibrium between each pair of microsatellite loci in each population was assessed using exact tests on contingency tables using GENEPOP version 4.0 (Raymond & Rousset 1995).
FIS was calculated for each locus and sample according to Nei (1987). The significance of FIS estimates was assessed by randomization tests (1000 replicates) using FSTAT (Goudet 1995, 2001). Each locus and sample was tested for large allele drop-out (short allele dominance) using MICROCHECKER (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004). Null allele frequencies for each locus and sample were calculated using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al. 1977), implemented by FREENA software (Chapuis & Estoup 2007), and by Brookfield’s method 1 (Brookfield 1996) using MICROCHECKER (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004). Population and individual inbreeding models were also used to estimate the inbreeding coefficient (F) and null allele frequency simultaneously from microsatellite data using INEST software (Yasuda 1968; Chybicki & Burczyk 2009).
FST was calculated using the ENA method, which corrects for the positive bias of null alleles on FST estimates (Chapuis & Estoup 2007). FST values were bootstrapped 10000 times over loci, and the 95% confidence intervals taken as the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles. The significance of the variation of allele frequencies between populations was tested by exact tests of homogeneity of allele frequency distribution (genic test) between populations using GENEPOP version 4.0 (Raymond & Rousset 1995). FST values cannot be higher than the homozygosity level, 1 ) HS (Hedrick 2005b). F0ST , an estimator unconstrained by genetic diversity, was therefore calculated as FST ⁄ 1 ) HS. HS, the unbiased estimate of genetic diversity was calculated following Nei (1987) using FSTAT version 2.9.3 (Goudet 1995, 2001).
Individual-based Bayesian approaches were implemented to search for cryptic population structure. The technique minimizes the departure from HWE and linkage disequilibrium resulting from individuals originating from K randomly mating populations being grouped into one population. STRUCTURE was used to search for population structure without prior information on sample locations (Pritchard et al. 2000; Falush et al. 2003). Ten replicates of the calculations were performed for K = 1–10, and the log likelihood of each inferred structure recorded. For each calculation 60 000 iterations were performed, with the first 10 000 discarded as burn-in. Optimum values of K were inferred using the DeltaK method of Evanno et al. (2005). Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software
version 5.2 (Corander et al. 2003, 2004) was also used to search for cryptic population structure. Initially, we ran BAPSwithKsettomaximaofK=5,10,15or20,replicated five times (such that all values of K = 2 to K = maximum were investigated), followed by 10 replicate runs each with fixed K of K = 2–15.
Population size estimates
Current effective population size (Ne) was estimated based on allele frequency changes between two samples from Rio Campo, collected in August 2003 and July 2005. Two methods were used: the moment-based (NeF) method of (Waples 1989) and the likelihood-based (NeL) method of Berthier et al. (2002). Both approaches assume that allele frequency change is solely attributable to genetic drift. Both also assume independent sampling of individuals and independent (unlinked) loci.
For moment-based NeF estimates, a sampling plan in which individuals are taken before reproduction and not replaced was assumed (Plan II, Waples 1989). Samples used in this study were not replaced, but it is not known whether samples were taken before or after reproduction. Calculations were performed using the software NEESTIMATOR 1.3 (Peel et al. 2004).
The likelihood-based method relies on the assumption that gene genealogies tend to be coalescent as population size increases. To calculate likelihood-based NeL, the coalescent-based approach developed by Berthier et al. (2002) was implemented by the TM3 program, within NEESTIMATOR 1.3 with 20 000 iterations and a NeMAX of 5000 (Peel et al. 2004). An appropriate value for NeMAX was determined empirically by running analysis with NeMAX of 500, 1000 and 5000 for all-locus estimates and observing likelihood posterior distribution plots (Fig. S3). Both NeF and NeL methods require information on the number of generations between time point samples. Glossina generation times vary with the species and environmental conditions (mainly temperature). Based on the duration of the different life stages, the generation length in days varies between 38 and 120. At 25 °C, generation time is around 43 days (Hargrove 2005). Taking the time interval between collections (2 years or approximately 730 days) and the tropical humid climate with mean annual temperatures around 25 °C in Equatorial Guinea, we predict about 16 generations between temporal samples in Rio Campo. This gives roughly eight generations per year which was the value used to estimate NeF for Glossina pallidipes in southwestern Kenya (Ouma et al. 2006). Estimates were calculated assuming this value and a minimum and maximum of 6 (i.e. three per year) and 20 (i.e. 10 per year) generations respectively.

Simulation studies have shown that estimates of NeF are skewed by allele frequencies approaching 0 or 1 (very rare or very common alleles) (Waples 1989; Berthier et al. 2002). Rare alleles tend to lead to overestimation of NeF. Therefore, alleles with frequency <2% in both samples were pooled into a single class to calculate NeF and NeL. Conversely, the precision of NeL is increased with a higher number of independent alleles. Therefore, NeL was also calculated using the original database.
PCR and sequencing of COI and ITS1
PCR was used to amplify 880 bp of the 3¢-region of COI using the primers CI-J-2195 TTGATTTTTTGGTCATCCAGAAGT (Simon et al. 1994) and CULR TGAAGCTTAAATTCATTGCACTAATC as described previously (Dyer et al. 2008). A portion of ITS1 was amplified using the primers Diagfor (TGGACTTCGGATTAAGTACAACA) and Diagrev (TCATTATGCGCTATTAAGGTAAGC) as described previously (Dyer et al. 2008). PCR products were electrophoresed on 3% agarose gels labelled with ethidium bromide, and viewed using a UV transilluminator. Fragment size was determined by naked eye with respect to Hyperladder 5 (Bioline) and control products: G. p. palpalis from DRC and G. p. palpalis from Cameroon. All ITS1 PCRs were repeated and scored twice.
To determine the sequence of the different ITS1 length variants, where possible, a larger portion of ITS1 was amplified using either the Diagfor ⁄ Diagrev primer pair or 5.8SCAS5p8sB1dshort TGCGTTCAAAATGTCGATGTTCA and TCAS18sF1shorter CACACCGCCCGT CGCTACTA as described previously (Ji et al. 2003; Dyer et al. 2008).
For sequencing, PCR products were purified using Sureclean reagent (Bioline). COI PCR products were sequenced directly using an ABI 3730XL (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) capillary sequencer by Macrogen (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, South Korea). ITS1 PCR products were excised from agarose gel, cloned into the PGEM-TEASY vector (Promega) and sequenced using the SP6 and T7 promoter primers.
For each PCR product or plasmid sequenced, forward and reverse sequences were aligned and traces examined using CodonCode Aligner version 2.0.6 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA, USA).
Phylogenetic analysis
COI sequences were aligned and trimmed using the CLUSTALW algorithm in MEGA version 4 resulting in an alignment of 622 nucleotides. ITS1 sequences were aligned with published Glossina ITS1 data (GenBank
accession no. EU591930–EU591942) using PRANKSTER alignment software, which is more effective at recovering phylogenetically meaningful alignments of sequences containing many indels than CLUSTALW (Loytynoja & Goldman 2005, 2008).
COI sequences of 14 individuals with an ITS1 length of 240–250 or 240–250 plus 330 bp (one from Rio Campo, seven from Mbini and six from Kogo), as well as four of the individuals with the short (164 bp) ITS1 (KO138, KO144, RC136 and RC167) were aligned with published Glossina COI sequences (Dyer et al. 2008: GenBank accession no. EU591824, EU591826–EU591823, EU591836, EU591838–EU591844, EU591846–EU591848, EU591850–EU591865, EU591870–EU591871, EU591876– EU591877) and used to construct phylogenetic trees. Duplicate COI haplotypes were removed from the alignment for tree building. Maximum parsimony trees were generated using MEGA version 4, using the close neighbour interchange algorithm with search level 3 (Nei & Kumar 2000). Initial trees were obtained (100 replicates) by random order of sequence addition. MODELTEST (Posada & Crandall 1998) was used to choose the model of substitution to use for calculation of distances and tree building. The model favoured by Akaike Information Criterion 1 was the TRN + I + C model of evolution, with the proportion of invariable sites (I) = 0.7180 and the parameter describing the shape of the gamma distribution a = 1.2229 (Tamura & Nei 1993). The distance-based, neighbour-joining trees were produced using PAUP version 4.0 using heuristic tree searching (Swofford 2002). The maximum likelihood tree was generated using PHYML online, allowing four C categories (Guindon & Gascuel 2003; Guindon et al. 2005). In all cases, a consensus tree was generated from bootstrap replicates (2000 for maximum parsimony and distance and 1000 for maximum likelihood).
Two genetic distances were calculated: DXY, the average number of nucleotide substitutions between haplotypes from the two populations, and DA, the net number of nucleotide substitutions per site between haplotypes from pairs of populations (Nei 1987). The standard error of DXY and DA due to sampling was calculated using a bootstrap method with 2000 bootstraps using MEGA4 (Tamura et al. 2007). Estimates were computed for 16 individuals from Equatorial Guinea (14 individuals from this study plus two samples from Kogo from a previous study (EU591825 and EU591865), 10 individuals from DRC (EU591840–EU591842) from a previous study plus seven additional specimens from this study (FJ767870–FJ767871). West Africa was represented by 14 individuals from Cameroon (EU591829– EU591831, EU591860, EU591865), two from Togo (EU591838–EU591839), seven from Cote d’Ivoire (EU591846–EU591850) and five from Liberia

(EU591856–EU591859) (Dyer et al. 2008). For the G. p. palpalis–G. p. gambiensis comparison, all the above sequences were used to represent G. p. palpalis and a set of 55 G. p. gambiensis sequences were used, representing individuals from across the species range from Senegal (FJ787504, FJ787506–FJ787511), Guinea (FJ387505– FJ387524), the Gambia, Liberia and Burkina Faso (EU591849–EU591855). The 95% confidence intervals of DA were taken to be DA ) 1.96(SE) to DA + 1.96(SE). The minimum divergence time = DA ⁄ divergence rate. The ‘divergence rate’ is twice the substitution rate. To test the molecular clock, a tree was constructed using 52 sequences: the G. p. palpalis and G. p. gambiensis sequences above, without duplicate haplotypes, and an outgroup (G. fuscipes EU591876). The HKY + I + C model was defined by hierarchical likelihood ratio tests to be appropriate for this data set using MODELTEST (Posada & Crandall 1998). This model of evolution was used to estimate pairwise sequence distances to make a neighbour-joining tree using PAUP version 4.0 b10 (Swofford 2002) with 2000 bootstrap replicates. For the likelihood ratio test, the likelihood of this tree assuming the HKY substitution model either assuming clocklike evolution at the same rate throughout the tree (ln L1) or without assuming the molecular clock (ln L0) was calculated using the BASEML programme in the PAML package (Yang 1997). 2(ln L0 ) ln L1) is approximately chisquared distributed, with n ) 2 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of sequences. The two-cluster test tests the hypothesis that the average substitution rate in sister groups in the tree is the same. The lintre
package was used to implement the two-cluster test on the same data set as the likelihood ratio test (Takezaki et al. 1995).
Results
Internal transcribed spacer size polymorphism
The ITS1 PCR product sizes for all individuals are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The phenotypes observed were either no amplification, small (240– 250 bp) or large plus small (240–250 plus 330–333 bp). The relative intensity of these bands was variable, whereas the scoring system was discrete (Fig. 2). It is therefore possible that some individuals harbouring a small number of copies of the 330–333-bp ITS1 would have been scored as lacking that form. In addition, a total of nine individuals had an ITS1 size of 164 bp. A subset of these individuals was identified on the basis of genital morphology and abdominal second tergite pigmentation to be G. caliginea. Mitochondrial and microsatellite data were obtained for these individuals and are discussed below.
Ribosomal DNA, which consists of multiple tandem repeats, has been mapped to autosome L1 and the Y chromosome in G. p. palpalis (Willhoeft 1997). Due to the possibility of repeat size variation within the tandem array of each chromosome, we treated the ITS1 scores as phenotypic rather than diploid markers. The distribution of ITS1 forms between populations was tested by Fisher’s exact test on the contingency table of

repeat size frequencies in each population. Non-amplification was probably due to human error or poor DNA quality rather than mutations in the primer binding site, as the primers amplify ITS1 from a broad range of Glossina species. Therefore, cases of non-amplification were not included in the table for testing. Fisher’s exact test rejected the null hypothesis of random distribution of ITS forms between populations with high confidence (P > 0.001). This is due to the high frequency of individuals with two ITS forms in Kogo, as repeating the tests following exclusion of this population but not the other populations from the data set meant that the null hypothesis could not be rejected.
A portion of ITS1 was cloned from PCR products from five individuals from DRC and six individuals showing length polymorphism from Equatorial Guinea (two from Mbini and four from Kogo). To determine the position of insertions leading to length variation in ITS1, the resulting sequences were aligned with previously published ITS1 sequence data (Dyer et al. 2008) (Fig. S1). The position of the insertion leading to the 330 bp ITS1 in DRC and Equatorial Guinea is the same.
No evidence for hybrid forms in microsatellite data
The presence of ITS1 length polymorphism in Equatorial Guinea including alleles found in both West Africa and DRC might imply that the population in Equatorial Guinea included hybrids between West African and DRC forms. We sought to investigate the possibility of hybrid G. p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea using microsatellites. G. p. palpalis females (n = 124) were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci. The mean expected heterozygosity over loci ranged 0.726–0.773 and the mean number of alleles per locus ranged 9.9–12.3. No pair of microsatellites was in significant linkage disequilibrium in any population.
Most single-locus FIS values were positive indicating an excess of homozygotes, with 14 of 48 estimates significantly different from zero (Table 2). Short allele dominance and null alleles can bias FIS values upwards (Wattier et al. 1998). Short allele dominance was not detected at any locus in any population, indicating that short allele dominance was not a contributor to observed FIS values.
Null allele frequency for each locus and population was calculated. Dempster et al.’s (1977) EM method and Brookfield’s (1996) method 1 gave very similar estimates (Table 3). The estimated frequency (EM) was less than 10% for all loci except for Pgp1 (1–12%) Pgp17 (6–34%) and Pgp8 (0–13%) (Table 3). If high FIS values are due to null alleles, one would expect FIS to be variable amongst loci, with high FIS values for

loci with high null allele frequencies, whereas if high FIS values were caused by deviation from Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium genotype frequencies, then high FIS should be observed across loci. Concordantly, combined estimates of the inbreeding coefficient, F, and null allele frequencies resulted in estimates of F not significantly greater than zero in any of the studied populations (Table 2).
Cluster analysis of 12 loci microsatellite genotypes from 133 individuals (124 G. p. palpalis plus nine putative G. caliginea included as an outgroup) was used to investigate population structure. An optimum of two populations was identified using STRUCTURE using the DELTAK method (Fig. S2) (Evanno et al. 2005). In seven of the 10 replicate runs with K = 2, the G. p. palpalis (124) individuals, including one individual from the Kogo population, with an ITS1 of 164 bp were in one cluster, with the remaining eight G. caliginea individuals in a second cluster. These eight individuals all had a small ITS1 size of 164 bp. Two stable clusters were found using BAPS, with highly confident assignment of all individuals. The second cluster contained the same eight individuals as the second STRUCTURE cluster. Solutions suggesting greater levels of subdivision comprised of clusters in which many individuals were assigned with low levels of confidence.
The ENA method, which corrects for the positive bias of null alleles, was used to calculate FST (Table 4). Estimates were corrected for the constraint imposed by the genetic diversity HS (Hedrick 2005b). The presence of null alleles did not bias FST substantially. Per locus FST

The first number at the node is for the maximum likelihood tree (as a percent of 1000 bootstrap replications; TRN + I + C model of evolution), the second for the distance based tree (as a percent of 2000 bootstrap replications; TRN + I + C model of evolution), and the third number is for the maximum parsimony tree (as a percentage of 2000 bootstrap replications). The length of the ITS1 PCR product for G. p. palpalis and G. caliginea haplotypes is indicated. Clades of G. p. palpalis from West Africa (15 haplotypes), G. p. gambiensis (8 haplotypes), G. fuscipes (6 haplotypes), G. pallicera (5 haplotypes) and G. tachinoides (2 haplotypes) have been collapsed for clarity.
(one from Rio Campo, seven from Mbini and six from Kogo), as well as four G. caliginea individuals short (164 bp) ITS1 (KO138, KO144, RC136 and RC167) were aligned with published Glossina COI sequences (Dyer et al. 2008) and used to construct phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3). The 14 individuals sequenced had six haplotypes. Glossina p. palpalis COI sequences from Equatorial Guinea formed a well-supported clade (90% bootstrap support in maximum likelihood tree) regardless of ITS1 type. Furthermore, the Equatorial Guinea and DRC
specimens form a clade which is the sister group of the remainder of G. p. palpalis (bootstrap support for separation 88% in the maximum likelihood tree) The COI data for the specimens identified as G. caliginea on the basis of morphology and ITS1 phenotype formed a cluster that did not group with palpalis but as a sister taxon to the fuscipes and palpalis species. The different treebuilding methods inferred different relationships of G. caliginea to G. pallicera and G. tachinoides but with low bootstrap support (Fig. 3).

We used the net substitutions between populations in COI to estimate the time of divergence of G. p. palpalis from DRC, Equatorial Guinea and West Africa, and the divergence of G. p. palpalis and G. p. gambiensis (Table 5). The molecular clock hypothesis could not be rejected for G. p. gambiensis and G. p. palpalis COI sequences, as tested by a likelihood ratio test (P = 0.1222, using HKY85 model of evolution) and a two-cluster test (P > 0.05) (Takezaki et al. 1995; Yang 1996). We could not define confidently any suitable calibration point for the molecular clock for Glossina. Therefore, we used a range of substitution rates from 1.5% to 2.8% per Myr previously estimated for COI in insects (Buckley et al. 2001; Farrell 2001). The most recent estimate for the divergence of G. p. palpalis and G. gambiensis was 1.2 Myr, with subsequent splits between West African and DRC G. p. palpalis occurring no more recently than 0.7 Ma.
Estimating the variance effective population size of Rio Campo
Temporal-based estimates of Ne were made for the Rio Campo population based on allele frequency changes between the two samples collected in August 2003 and July 2005. Sixteen generations are expected to have elapsed between the sampling dates, corresponding to mean over-loci estimates of 501 for NeF and 731 for NeL (Table 6). Estimates obtained by NeL were consistently higher than those from NeF, although 95% confidence intervals overlapped on all occasions.
Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences suggests that G. p. palpalis populations from DRC and Equatorial Guinea form a sister group to West African G. p. palpalis. Consistent with this, the position of the insertion leading to the longer 330-bp ITS1 in DRC and Equatorial Guinea is the same. If large indels in ITS1 occur infrequently, ITS1 forms in DRC and Equatorial Guinea are probably identical by descent. The average percentage divergence in COI between Equatorial Guinea and West African G. p. palpalis was 4.6%, suggesting a high level of genetic differentiation between these widely spaced, allopatric populations. This level of sequence divergence is over
the 2% threshold which has been applied for distinguishing species using COI bar coding (Hebert et al. 2003a, b). Whilst assigning a species definition to an arbitrary level of sequence divergence is far from infallible, breeding experiments conducted on G. p. palpalis colonies originating in DRC and Nigeria showed hybrid male sterility, suggestive of cryptic species (Gooding et al. 2004). Although no sequence data are currently available for Nigerian G. p. palpalis, samples from Cameroon, which lies between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria, are not very divergent from those sampled further west.
The estimates of divergence times within G. p. palpalis in West Africa, DRC and Equatorial Guinea date the split between western and central (DRC plus Equatorial Guinea) no more recently than 0.7 Myr, and the split between G. p. palpalis and G. p. gambiensis no more recently than 1.2 Myr. This is considerably more ancient than the 19 000–13 000 G. p. palpalis–G. p. gambiensis split proposed by Challier et al. (1983). Although the contraction of forest habitats at the last glacial maximum (ca. 19 000 years ago) does not coincide with any G. palpalis divergence events, climate change and consequent habitat separation might still underlie allopatric speciation in the G. palpalis. With the broad time ranges estimated in the current study for the divergence events, it is not possible to assign a particular historical event to either divergence, as during the estimated time spans there have been multiple climate and vegetation changes (Leroy & Dupont 1994; Dupont et al. 2001; Schefuss et al. 2003). The estimated time of the divergence between DRC and Equatorial Guinea and West African G. p. palpalis largely overlaps that for the divergence of DRC from Equatorial Guinean G. p. palpalis, although the phylogeny suggests that the split with West African G. p. palpalis took place first. Given the large geographical scale of the G. p. palpalis species and the relatively recent time of these splits, retention of ancestral polymorphism may have confounded the phylogenetic analysis to some extent. Future efforts to elucidate the status of G. p. palpalis species should be extended to nuclear markers other than ITS.
If there are multiple species within G. p. palpalis, they may have started to diverge in behaviour. Will studies into odorant attractants and trap or target design for

G. p. palpalis performed in West Africa be applicable to G. p. palpalis southeast of Cameroon? Without breeding experiments to confirm the specific status and the number of the various putative cryptic species, control measures developed in West Africa should be tested for effectiveness in a field context in countries such as Equatorial Guinea and DRC.
Although the ITS1 data suggested that hybrid forms of G. p. palpalis might exist in Equatorial Guinea, we did not find significant evidence for population subdivision using microsatellite markers. Nor did the mitochondrial COI data correlate with ITS1 length polymorphism in Equatorial Guinea. Based on the COI data, a more parsimonious explanation would be that the insertion leading to the 330 bp ITS1 may have occurred in the common ancestor of G. p. palpalis in DRC and Equatorial Guinea after it diverged from West African G. p. palpalis. The insertion subsequently has become fixed or at very high frequency in DRC, whereas in Equatorial Guinea both ITS1 forms persist. Ohta & Dover (1984) modelled the population variance in copy number of new variant repeats during the homogenization of repeats in multigene families. This relative variance is expected to increase with decreasing interchromosomal recombination rate, increasing gene conversion rates and increasing population size. High relative variance in ITS1 variants has been attributed to a high intrachromosomal gene conversion rate in the meadow grasshopper subspecies Chorthippus parallelus parallelus and Chorthippus parallelus erythropus, which diverged around 0.5 Ma (Parker & Butlin 2004). The maintenance of at least two variants of the ITS1 of ribosomal DNA in G. p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea might indicate that the process of homogenization of ribosomal DNA tandem repeats is relatively slow compared with the divergence time of G. p. palpalis populations in Equatorial Guinea and DRC. The number of copies of the ribosomal DNA locus in G. p. palpalis must be found before further inferences can be made regarding the variance in repeat number of ITS1 variants and interchromosomal recombination rates.
Simultaneous estimation of null allele frequency and inbreeding suggested that the departure from Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium frequencies within populations was more likely due to null alleles than to a Wahlund effect (subdivided populations) or immigrants. Consistently, analysis of population structure using BAPS or STRUCTURE did not reveal the presence of multiple populations. High FIS values have previously been recorded for G. p. palpalis around the recently described Bonon focus of Coˆte d’Ivoire (Ravel et al. 2007). In Bonon, the high FIS values were not entirely explained by null alleles or short allele dominance, and assignment into 25 BAPS clusters led to a significant decrease in FIS,
leading to the conclusion that the captured flies originated from multiple cryptic populations. In the current study, null alleles may have reduced the sensitivity of the population assignment tests in STRUCTURE and BAPS, but low values of the inbreeding coefficient after correction for null alleles imply that sub-structuring is not as strong in the Equatorial Guinea HAT foci as in the more recently defined Bonon focus. Cano et al. (2007a) noted that recolonization of treated zones from nontreated zones might be occurring at Kogo. The low levels of genetic differentiation detected between three physically separated sites in this study make detection of immigrant flies from more closely separated areas in Equatorial Guinea or neighbouring Gabon and Cameroon unlikely. To use assignment tests successfully in Equatorial Guinea, it will be necessary to either extend the set of markers to more than 12 microsatellites, or to redesign more of the current primers specifically for use on the species present in Equatorial Guinea.
Despite the high level of divergence over the large geographical separation between G. p. palpalis in DRC and Equatorial Guinea, the population structure does not imply strong geographical isolation at a small scale, within Equatorial Guinea itself. The FST values between the geographically separated G. p. palpalis populations in Equatorial Guinea were small but significant. If ITS1 length polymorphism does not imply the presence of inter-sub-specific hybrid flies, it could just be considered another marker of within-population polymorphism. In that case, ITS1 length polymorphism frequency data simply suggest that Kogo was the most divergent of the three sites, consistent with the observed FST estimates. However, frequency variation of ITS1 length variants between the populations suggests larger expected FST values between Kogo and the other sites than observed with microsatellites. This discrepancy may be due to concerted evolution accelerating the spread of new ITS1 variants across the genome and thus accelerating their spread through populations. Alternatively, the ribosomal DNA locus may be linked to a locus under selection. Overall, the data on the level of genetic differentiation of G. p. palpalis populations at the three HAT foci in Equatorial Guinea do not suggest that any of them is strongly isolated. Therefore, vector control operations will be most effective when carried out over a large geographical scale, as suggested by (Cano et al. 2007a). FST estimates are similar to those obtained using microsatellite markers for G. p. gambiensis, on a similar geographical scale along the Mouhoun River, Burkina Faso, although in Equatorial Guinea the sample sites were not along one river. Much higher levels of genetic differentiation between populations (FST 0.1–0.3) have been previously recorded for various tsetse fly species over equivalent geographic scales

(Solano et al. 1999; Krafsur & Endsley 2002; Ouma et al. 2006, 2007; Abila et al. 2008). Is the dispersal capability of G. p. palpalis particularly high, or is this low divergence due to a more continuous habitat in Equatorial Guinea than in other studied countries? A mark– release–recapture experiment on G. p. gambiensis in a tributary of the Mouhoun River, Burkina Faso, was used to estimate the dispersal characteristics of that species along its linear (one-dimensional) gallery forest habitat (Cuisance et al. 1985; Bouyer et al. 2007a). The one-dimensional diffusion coefficient a was estimated at 0.46 km2 ⁄ day, assuming that traps, positioned along the main river but not its tributaries only allowed a partial observation of the dispersal process due to missing flies on the tributaries (Bouyer et al. 2007a). The palpalis group species G. f. fuscipes has an estimated diffusion coefficient in two dimensional habitat of 0.029 km2 ⁄ day, much lower than the estimate for G. p. gambiensis (Rogers 1977). The coastal mangrove habitat of Equatorial Guinea is not a strict gallery forest with savannah on either side, and so movement between rivers in a two-dimensional dispersal pattern seems more likely than in Burkina Faso.
The variance effective population size of G. p. palpalis in Rio Campo, mainland northern Equatorial Guinea, was estimated at around 500 individuals, much larger than the moment-based estimate of the Loos Islands G. p. gambiensis population of <50 (Solano et al. 2009). The variance effective population size was similar to that estimated using the moment-based method for the morsitans group species G. pallidipes in the Nguruman and Lambwe valleys in Kenya (Ouma et al. 2006). Ne is likely to be much smaller than the census population size (N) that would be measured by methods such as mark–release–recapture: the median Ne ⁄ N ratio from 83 studies of a wide taxonomic range or organisms using the temporal method was only 0.14 (Palstra & Ruzzante 2008). Apart from being affected by population bottlenecks Ne ⁄ N is particularly small when there is a large variation in reproductive success (Hauser et al. 2002; Hedrick 2005a). In tsetse, there is likely to be variation in male reproductive success but little variation in female reproductive success (Solano et al. 2009). The use of both ecological and genetic methods on the same tsetse populations could be used to estimate the Ne⁄N ratio, and its variation among populations. In the future, analysis of population samples before and after control measures could be considered for assessing their success in reducing the population size.
