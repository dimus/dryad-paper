ABSTRACT: A new species of squeaker frog (genus Arthroleptis) is described from the northern mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line, a species-rich region within the West African biodiversity hotspot. This new species is associated with human-altered landscapes, including farms and grasslands, and is known from the highland areas near Bamenda, including Mt. Oku, Cameroon, as well as the Obudu and Mambilla Plateaus of eastern Nigeria. The known distribution suggests that it may eventually also be found throughout the AchaTugi Ridge that traverses the Cameroon–Nigeria border. More than 40 years ago, a specimen from one of these populations was recognized as probably representing a new species, but no further work was published on this material. We posit that the taxonomy of this new species has proven problematic because of morphological similarity to Arthroleptis poecilonotus. Although in some ways resembling A. poecilonotus, a molecular phylogeny based on mitochondrial gene sequence data demonstrates that the new species is not closely related to A. poecilonotus and, instead, forms a clade with A. krokosua, A. perreti, and A. variabilis. The new species is diagnosable by the combination of medium–small body size (24–29 mm snout–vent length in adult females), the color patterns of the venter and head, and a relatively stout hindlimb with a prominent inner metatarsal tubercle. The description of this new species further highlights these mountains as an important region of endemism within the Cameroon Volcanic Line.

WITHIN THE West African biodiversity hotspot (sensu Myers et al., 2000), the mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line form an important region of endemism for amphibians (Stuart et al., 2004). This geological structure comprises three ecoregions as defined by Burgess et al. (2004) and consists of the islands of the Gulf of Guinea (Bioko, Pr ́ıncipe, Sa ̃ o Tome ́ , and Annobo ́ n) and the mountains of Cameroon and eastern Nigeria (De ́ruelle et al., 1991; Marzoli et al., 2000). During the past 40 years, many new species of amphibians have been described from these mainland and island mountains (Amiet, 1971a,b, 1972a,b, 1973, 1977, 1980a,b, 1981, 2000, 2001, 2004a,b; Amiet and Dowsett-Lemaire, 2000; Blackburn, 2008a, 2010a,b; Blackburn et al., 2009; Boistel and Amiet, 2001; Drewes and Wilkinson, 2004; Herrmann et al., 2004; Kobel et al., 1980; Lawson, 2000; Loumont and Kobel, 1991; Nussbaum, 1985; Nussbaum and Pfrender, 1998; Perret, 1971; Plath et al.,

2006; Ro ̈del et al., 2004; Uyeda et al., 2007; Zimkus, 2009). Although the islands and mountains near the coast contain many endemic species, there are also many amphibian species endemic to mountains to the north that are associated with the Bamile ́ke ́, Adamawa, Mambilla, and Obudu Plateaus (e.g., Amiet, 1972a,b, 1977, 1980a, 1981; Blackburn, 2010a; Boistel and Amiet, 2001; Herrmann et al., 2004; Lawson, 2000; Loumont and Kobel, 1991; Perret, 1971; Zimkus, 2009).
We describe a new species of squeaker frog (genus Arthroleptis) that is endemic to the mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line; moreover, it seems to be localized to the northern mountains found in Cameroon and Nigeria (Fig. 1). Recent studies of Arthroleptis (sensu Blackburn, 2008b) have revealed many new species found in locations as distant as Liberia and Tanzania (Blackburn, 2008b, 2009a, 2010b; Blackburn et al., 2009; Ernst et al., 2008; Poynton, 2003; Poynton et al., 2008; Ro ̈del et al., 2009). The new species that we describe here was first known based on a specimen collected on the Obudu Plateau in

1959 that Schiøtz (1963) noted ‘‘seems to represent an undescribed species,’’ although no further details were provided in subsequent publications. That this species was never described is probably due, at least in part, to its morphological similarity to A. poecilonotus, a taxon with a difficult taxonomic history (Blackburn, 2008b, 2010b; Ro ̈ del, 2000; Ro ̈ del and Bangoura, 2004). A recent phylogenetic analysis revealed that specimens morphologically similar to that reported by Schiøtz (1963) were distantly related to A. poecilonotus and instead formed a clade with A. variabilis and the recently described A. perreti (Blackburn, 2008b; Blackburn et al., 2009). Here, we add more specimens of the new species to a phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequence data that further supports the distinctness of this historically problematic new species.
Specimens were collected during visual encounter surveys conducted by the authors during fieldwork in Cameroon (Gvozˇd ́ık in 2005; Blackburn in 2006) and Nigeria (Leache ́ in 2006; Blackburn in 2009). Type material was examined of all species discussed (by D. C. Blackburn; see Appendix I), except those of the recently described A. nguruensis Poynton, Menegon, and Loader 2008 and A. stenodactylus Pfeffer, 1893, the latter having been destroyed during World War II (Frost, 2009). All measurements (6 0.1 mm) were taken by DCB using digital calipers and a dissecting microscope; limb measurements were taken on the right side. Measurements follow Blackburn (2005), which is a modification of Matsui (1984); tympanum height was measured as the vertical diameter of the tympanum. Museum abbreviations follow Leviton et al. (1985), with the exception of Museums of Malawi, Blantyre (MMB) and National Museum, Prague (NMP).
We extend the phylogenetic analysis of Blackburn (2008b) by including additional specimens of the new species, A. bioko (Blackburn, 2010b), and Arthroleptis ‘‘poecilonotus.’’ Genetic data were obtained for seven additional specimens of the new species and three A. ‘‘poecilonotus’’ from the Oban Hills of eastern Nigeria (Table 1). We view the inclusion of the additional A. ‘‘poecilonotus’’ specimens as particularly important because they were collected near to the Obudu Plateau and allow us to test species boundaries and the geographic distribution of the new species. Evolutionary relationships were determined through phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data for the mitogenomic region containing the genes encoding for 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA and the intervening transfer RNA for valine; phylogenetic relationships among this and other Arthroleptis based on multilocus nuclear data will be presented elsewhere (D. C. Blackburn, unpublished data). Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples using a guanidine thiocyanate method following the protocol of Esselstyn et al. (2008). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the target region; primer pairs and PCR conditions follow Darst and Cannatella (2004). Purification and sequencing follows Esselstyn et al.

 (2008). Consensus sequences were generated in Sequencer version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation) and manually vetted. After alignment (see below), autapomorphic states (base pair changes, insertions, or deletions) for both new data and those presented in Blackburn (2008b) were verified by inspection of chromatograms; in some cases, changes were made to previously published sequences (Table 1), and these corrections have been submitted to GenBank. Resulting sequence lengths are as follows: A. sp. nov. (MCZ A139527, 1957 base pairs [bp]; MCZ A-139528, 1955 bp; MVZ 253131, 1945 bp; MVZ 253132, 1939 bp; MVZ 253140, 1932 bp; MVZ 253141, 1937 bp; NMP6V 73368, 1885 bp) and A. ‘‘poecilonotus’’ (MVZ 243134, 1948 bp; MVZ 253135, 1887 bp; MVZ 253139, 1934 bp). Newly collected sequences were accessioned in GenBank (Table 1).
For phylogenetic analysis, these newly collected sequences were included in an analysis with representatives of other Arthroleptis species based on the results of Blackburn (2008b; Table 1). The data set was restricted to members of the A. poecilonotus species complex (A. bioko, A. brevipes, and A. ‘‘poecilonotus’’), A. adelphus, A. variabilis, and A. perreti (the latter corresponds to ‘‘A. sp. nov. 1’’ of Blackburn, 2008b; see Blackburn et al., 2009); we follow Blackburn (2010b) in assigning populations from the Togo Hills of eastern Ghana to A. brevipes. These species formed a clade in the phylogenetic analysis of Blackburn (2008b), which included many other Arthroleptis species from elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on morphological similarities, we also included data from A. krokosua, which is known from a single specimen collected in western Ghana (Ernst

 et al., 2008). Because Blackburn (2008b) found A. stenodactylus to be sister to the clade of the above-mentioned species, we also included this species in the analysis. A multiple alignment of the resulting data set, comprising DNA sequences of unequal length for 33 terminal taxa, was generated using default parameters in Clustal X version 1.83.1 (Thompson et al., 1997). The resulting alignment was trimmed such that it corresponds to positions 2526–4587 of the Xenopus laevis mitochondrial genome (GenBank NC-001573).
The best-fit model of sequence evolution (GTR + I + C) was selected using the Akaike information criterion (AIC 5 16657.07) as implemented in MrModeltest version 2.3 (Nylander, 2004). Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian estimates of phylogeny were generated. ML analyses were conducted on the aligned sequence data in Garli version 0.96b8 (Zwickl, 2006) using a random starting tree and a GTR + I + C model of sequence evolution with all parameters estimated. Fifty search repetitions of ML analysis were carried out and the estimate with the lowest 2ln likelihood score used as the preferred ML phylogeny; each search was terminated 10 3 105 generations after the last topological improvement. One thousand nonparametric bootstrap replicates were performed in Garli using the same model of sequence evolution; each bootstrap replicate contained one search replicate that was terminated 2 3 104 generations after the last topological improvement. Branches present in $70% of the bootstrap replicate phylogenies were considered well supported following Hillis and Bull (1993). A Bayesian estimate of phylogeny was obtained using MrBayes version 3.1.2 and GTR + I + C model of sequence evolution. Four runs of four MCMC chains were run for 20 million generations, sampled every 2000 generations, using a temperature of 0.2 and default priors. Convergence was assessed by examining correlations of split frequencies among runs in AWTY (Nylander et al., 2008). The first two million generations were discarded as burn-in following examination of trends and distributions of log-likelihoods and parameter values using Tracer version 1.4 (Rambaut and Drummond, 2007); estimated sample sizes from the four combined
runs were all above 22,000. The phylogeny and posterior probabilities were then estimated from the remaining trees; split support was calculated using SumTrees (Sukumaran and Holder, 2008). In addition, the maximum clade credibility tree (the post burn-in tree with the maximum product of the posterior clade probabilities) was estimated using TreeAnnotater version 1.5.3 (Rambaut and Drummond, 2009). Topologies with posterior probabilities $0.95 were considered well supported following Wilcox et al. (2002). Parsimony analyses of these data resulted in a similar topology of interspecific relationships (data not shown). Based on Blackburn (2008b), Cardioglossa gracilis was used as an outgroup to root the phylogeny.
RESULTS
The phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2) resulted in a pattern of interspecific relationships that is identical to that found by Blackburn (2008b). The topologies of the maximum likelihood and the maximum clade credibility trees are nearly identical. The single exception is that MCZ A-137983 from Mt. Oku is more closely related to two specimens from the Mambilla Plateau (MCZ A-138527–8) in the maximum likelihood topology but more closely related to other specimens from Cameroon (NMP6V 73368, 73343/3–/4, 73437) in the maximum clade credibility tree. Interspecific relationships exhibit high support from both nonparametric bootstrapping and Bayesian posterior probabilities. The additional specimens of A. ‘‘poecilonotus’’ from the Oban Hills of eastern Nigeria form a highly supported clade with morphologically similar specimens from Cameroon; genetic divergence among A. ‘‘poecilonotus’’ from Cameroon and Nigeria is very low (,0.01% uncorrected p-distance). The topology within the poecilonotus species complex (sensu Blackburn, 2010b) is similar to that found by Blackburn (2008b), but there is low support for the sister relationship between A. ‘‘poecilonotus’’ from Sierra Leone and western Ghana. There is strong support that A. perreti is sister to a well supported clade (bootstrap 5 70%; posterior probability 5 0.99; Fig. 2) comprising A. variabilis, A. krokosua, and the new species described below. There is strong support (bootstrap 5

Because the populations from the northern mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line are genealogically exclusive (with respect to mitochondrial DNA) and are morphologically diagnosable, we describe these as a new species.

 Diagnosis.—A medium–small Arthroleptis that is distinguished from other Arthroleptis by the combination of body size, the color patterns of the venter and head, and a relatively stout hindlimb with a prominent inner metatarsal tubercle. Adult female body size of A. palava is smaller (26.9 6 2.5 mm; n 5 5) than the other Arthrolepis from Central and western Africa with which it forms a clade: A. krokosua (43.3 mm; n 5 1; from Ernst et al., 2008), A. perreti (37.5 6 4.3 mm; n 5 25; from Blackburn et al., 2009), and A. variabilis (33.1 6 3.0 mm; n 5 27; from Blackburn et al., 2009). Arthroleptis palava differs in the following ways from other Arthroleptis species that are ‘‘medium–small’’ to large (i.e., species larger than maximum snout–vent length [SVL] $25 mm): from A. adelphus by having a more defined (although sometimes fragmented) supratympanic band, generally smoother skin on the dorsal and lateral surfaces, and smaller body size (female A. adelphus: 32.5 6 0.90 mm; n 5 5); from A. adolfifriederici by a more flange-like inner metatarsal tubercle and smaller body size (female A. adolfifriederici: 37.8 6 4.1 mm; n
5 6); from A. affinis by lacking well-defined supernumerary tubercles on the feet (although some specimens of A. palava have a weakly developed supernumerary tubercle at the base of the second toe) and smaller body size (.30 mm in A. affinis); from A. bioko and A. francei by having a relatively larger inner metatarsal tubercle and by generally having a fragmented supratympanic band; from A. krokosua by lighter pigmentation on throat and vent, lacking large well-defined black spots on the lateral surface of the body, and by a fourth finger that is nearly always longer than the first and second fingers; from A. perreti by lacking a darkly colored posterior thigh with many well-defined white spots; from A. reichei by having generally less expanded finger and toe tips; from A. stenodactylus by generally having a fragmented supratympanic band and more pigmentation on the venter; from A. nikeae by much smaller adult body size (.50 mm in A. nikeae); from A. tanneri and A. nguruensis by smaller adult body size (.40 mm in A. tanneri and A. nguruensis) and a relatively narrower head; from A. tuberosus by less

 tuberculate skin; from A. variabilis by lacking a well-defined pale stripe on the midline of the throat (although it is incipient in some specimens of A. palava); from A. wahlbergii by having a more prominent inner metatarsal tubercle, by lacking a prominent well-defined dark inguinal spot, and by lacking welldefined supernumerary metatarsal tubercles.

 with dark gray markings; single, but broken, transverse dark gray band on dorsal surface of distal thigh; posterior surface of thigh pale gray base color, densely covered with small dark gray melanophores forming no obvious pattern; base color of dorsal foot pale gray with dark gray markings; pedal digits with similar ‘‘banding’’ pattern as manual digits, but less well-defined; region surrounding cloaca similar in coloration to adjacent dorsal surface of thighs.
Lateral margin of lower jaw with prominent dark brownish gray spots and few interdigitated white spots along the anterior two-thirds of jaw; throat pale gray base with brown melanophores concentrated into clumps; scattered white blotches on throat, concentrated along midline to form incipient line at gular midline; gular color pattern continues across venter, with pronounced disruption at posterior border of coracoids; medial surfaces of arm and forearm pale gray (unpigmented) with medium to dark brown markings; ventral surface of arm pale gray with no markings; ventral surface of forearm mottled medium and dark brown; ventral surface of hand and fingers pale brown; palmar, metacarpal, subarticular tubercles, and finger tips pale gray (unpigmented); posteriormost venter (near ‘‘seat-patch’’) pale creamy gray with no dark markings; ventral and anterior thigh and ventral crus with similar pattern to venter; plantar surface dark brownish gray with few small pale gray spots; subarticular tubercles on toes, inner metatarsal tubercle, and ventral toe tips pale gray (unpigmented).
Coloration in life.—Dorsal coloration ranging pale to medium brown with small dark brown markings (Fig. 4); when present, dorsal midline stripe pale cream in life (i.e., specimens from Mambilla Plateau and Bamenda Highlands; MCZ A-139527–8, NMP6V 73343/4, 73437); darker markings on dorsal and lateral surfaces ranging from dark brown to almost black; paler markings on lateral surface ranging from pale brown to creamy tan; ventral surface of throat and body gray to white with dark brown markings (Fig. 4); iris golden with black vermiculations and black pupil (Fig. 4).
Variation.—Morphometric and meristic variation is documented in Table 2. Adult females exhibit larger body size than adult males (mean female SVL: 26.9 mm 6 2.5;
mean male SVL: 23.5 6 1.1; two-tailed test with unequal variance P 5 0.04). Specimens of A. palava exhibit variation in color patterns. Most specimens exhibit a pale interorbital bar that is lined along both the anterior and posterior margin with small dark spots, sometimes forming a line. In some specimens this pale interorbital bar blends seamlessly into the pale coloration of the snout (MVZ 253140), whereas in others this bar is entirely absent (MCZ A-139528). Several specimens exhibit a pale stripe running along the dorsum from the rostral tip to the vent (Mambilla Plateau: MCZ A-139527–8; Bamenda Highlands: NMP6V 73343/4, 73437). In addition, specimens from the Mambilla (MCZ A139527–8) and Obudu (MVZ 243132) Plateaus exhibit an incipient pale stripe along the gular midline. In most specimens of A. palava, the supratympanic band, extending from the posterior corner of the eye to behind the tympanum, is fragmented, although several specimens from the Obudu Plateau and most specimens from the Bamenda Highlands exhibit a more-or-less continuous band on one or both sides (MVZ 253131–2; NMP6V 73343/3–4, 73437; ZMUC R072268). The intensity of pigmentation on the venter varies among specimens of A. palava with those from the Mambilla Plateau and Bamenda Highlands exhibiting the darkest pigmentation; however, all specimens exhibit pigmentation on the venter.
Secondary sexual characters.—Male specimens of A. palava have a hypertrophied third finger (range: 18.5–21.3% SVL [n 5 3]; 15.8 6 0.01% SVL in females [n 5 5]) with small spines lining the medial surface of the second and third fingers. Ranges of the number of spines on the digits (Table 2) are similar to those reported for A. perreti and A. variabilis (Blackburn, 2009b; Blackburn et al., 2009). One male (ZMUC R072268) has fewer spines on the second finger than other specimens, but this may be an indication of having not attained full maturity because these spines are only weakly developed and the specimen is slightly smaller than other male specimens. Furthermore, males exhibit spines extending from the inguinal region, on the dorsal surface just anterior to the vent, and extending along the lateral body surface at least past the snout–vent midpoint.

 Distribution and natural history.—Specimens were collected at various sites in humanmodified landscapes, including a field station at Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve and a eucalyptus plantation near Yelwa (both on the Mambilla Plateau), and farmland near ElakOku Village on Mt. Oku as well as elsewhere in the Bamenda Highlands (Fig. 1). The call of this species has not yet been recorded. If the known localities are taken to define the elevational range of this species (1000– 1900 m) and it has a uniform distribution throughout the northern mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line, then the estimated extent of occurrence of A. palava may exceed 30,000 km2.
Conservation.—At present, A. palava is known only from sites in obviously humanmodified landscapes. Forests at many of these sites have been degraded by human use (Ash and Dowsett-Lemaire, 1989; Ash and Sharland, 1986; Chapman et al., 2004; Gartshore, 1986; Lea et al., 2005; Stuart, 1986), but it is unlikely that this threatens A. palava. Because of its large estimated area of occurrence and lack of conservation concerns, we recommend that A. palava be considered Least Concern according to IUCN (2008) criteria.
Etymology.—The specific epithet is a noun in apposition and, in recognition of the likely past confusion of this new species with A. poecilonotus, is a word meaning ‘‘problem’’ in the pidgins of Central and West Africa.
DISCUSSION
In January 1959, A. Schiøtz collected the first specimen of A. palava on the Obudu Plateau. Despite the suggestion that this represented a new species (Schiøtz, 1963) and a brief later reference to this specimen (Schiøtz, 1966), we know of no further mention of either this specimen or that it may have represented a new species. We suggest that this is due, at least in part, to morphological similarity to A. poecilonotus, which is a complex of morphologically similar species (Blackburn, 2010b; Ro ̈ del, 2000; Ro ̈del and Bangoura, 2004). Arthroleptis palava exhibits similar dorsal coloration to members of the poecilonotus species complex and is similar in body size (‘‘poecilonotus’’
mean male SVL: 24.0 6 2.2 mm; n 5 13; from Blackburn, in press, b). Until recently, the systematics of the poecilonotus species complex has been impenetrable because of a lack of genetic or acoustic resources. However, both molecular phylogenetic (Blackburn, 2009a; this study) and morphological studies (Blackburn, 2010b) are now facilitating the delimitation of taxa within this species complex, including the discovery of morphologically distinctive taxa (Blackburn, 2010b). For example, a combination of molecular and morphological data (Blackburn, 2009a, 2010b) reveals that A. brevipes, previously known only from one specimen, is probably a valid taxon found in the region of western Togo and eastern Ghana. Before the past 20 years, there have been few, if any, thorough surveys of populations throughout the range attributed to A. poecilonotus, and some of these populations can be quite variable morphologically (e.g., Ro ̈del, 2000). Because of the similarity in body size and coloration, it was not until a recent molecular phylogenetic analysis (Blackburn, 2009a) that it was apparent that populations in the northern mountains of Cameroon represented a new taxon that is only distantly related to the poecilonotus species complex. Further search for specimens revealed that this new species is morphologically distinct from the poecilonotus species complex, is also found in the mountains of eastern Nigeria, and corresponds to the specimen first collected by A. Schiøtz more than 50 years ago.
Although Ernst et al. (2008) provided a cursory study of the relationships of A. krokosua, this is the first phylogenetic analysis including this recently described species. The hierarchical clustering analysis of morphometric data presented by Ernst et al. (2008) found A. krokosua to be similar to A. variabilis. Thus, it is not surprising that the phylogenetic results presented here demonstrate A. krokosua to form a clade with A. variabilis. Although the ML estimate of phylogeny places A. krokosua as sister to A. palava, this branching pattern receives low support (bootstrap 5 55%; posterior probability 5 0.86; Fig. 2). However, if true, this topological pattern would suggest a more complicated pattern of spatial diversification than one in

 which vicariance results in two lowland or two montane species. Instead, the pattern is suggestive that vicariance might have occurred along elevational gradients, resulting in a pair of sister species, one species in the lowlands and one species in montane areas.
Morphological similarities between A. palava and several distantly related Arthroleptis species may be indicative of ecological convergence. Arthroleptis palava is similar to both A. francei and A. stenodactylus in having stocky hindlimbs in which the length of the crus (i.e., tibiofibula) is less than half of snout– vent length. Also similar to A. stenodactylus, the length of the inner metatarsal tubercle is typically .80% of the length of the first toe. Both A. francei and A. stenodactylus can be found in a variety of habitat types, including grasslands and forests or woodlands, and the latter is known to burrow in loose soil (Channing, 2001; D. C. Blackburn, personal observation). Emerson (1988) found a correlation between relative hindlimb length and locomotor mode with taxa with shorter hindlimbs tending toward walking and burrowing. Similar to the three species most closely related to it (A. krokosua, A. perreti, and A. variabilis), A. palava exhibits a large flange-like inner metatarsal tubercle that ranges from 60% to 110% of the length of the first toe. However, unlike the other three species, the hindlimb of A. palava is stocky; the crus is .50% of snout–vent length in A. krokosua, A. perreti, and A. variabilis (e.g., Blackburn et al., 2009; Ernst et al., 2008). Because A. palava is found in habitats unlike those of these other species, including grasslands, it suggests that these morphological differences are associated with a divergent ecology. Furthermore, the lack of sister-taxon relationships among A. francei, A. palava, and A. stenodactylus suggest that the morphological similarities among these species represent convergence, probably driven by transitions to similar habitat types.
