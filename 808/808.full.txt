Forty-three forest sites in seven sampling areas in mountainous parts of Transylvania were sampled to obtain inventories of their snail faunas, and to make comparisons between these and the faunas of similar sites further north along the Carpathian chain. Sampling areas ran from close to the Ukrainian border in the north to Retezat in the south-west. Altogether, 83 species were found, as well as between 19 and 40 species at individual sites. Sites within the same sampling area had more species in common than in among-area comparisons, although differences between areas did not relate to the distance between them. Such differences appear to be related more to ecological factors than to geography. Faunas of all areas were very similar to those recorded from the Polish and Ukrainian Carpathians; distance from these northern faunas had little effect on similarity. More broadly, the fauna of these forests shows a much greater affinity to those of countries to the north than to those of countries to the south. Despite the survival of forests through the last glacial period of the Pleistocene, and the greater proximity to potential Mediterranean refugia, these faunas appear to be mainly a subset of those found further north. They represent a rather small proportion of the known Romanian fauna, in which there are many endemics restricted to other habitats. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 104, 471–479.

  INTRODUCTION
The present distributions of the fauna and flora of Europe are profoundly influenced by the sequence of glacial and interglacial episodes of the Pleistocene. With the exception of Arctic-Alpine relicts, northern areas have biotas derived from refuges further south; typically, species have relatively wide geographical ranges and are monotypic. Regional richness is
consequently much lower than in comparable regions further south, where there are many restricted endemics. This general pattern has been linked to known refugia in Iberia, Italy and the Balkans, although recent work suggests that the more southerly parts of Central Europe (Slovakia, Hungary and Romania) retained some forests and their associated fauna throughout the last glacial maximum (Willis, Rudner & Sümegi, 2000; Willis & van Andel, 2004; Ložek, 2006; Birks & Willis, 2008) Thus, these cryptic glacial refugia could represent a source of colonizers moving north.

 This general pattern is shown clearly by land mollusc faunas (Hausdorf & Hennig, 2003; Cameron, 2004; Pokryszko & Cameron, 2005), and northern faunas can be seen as subsets of those further south (Hausdorf, 2006). Although there are certainly differences among northern faunas, relating both to present climatic regimes, and to different sources of colonization from more southerly refuges (Hausdorf & Hennig, 2003), the rate of distance decay in faunal similarity (Nekola & White, 1999) across the North European Plain is much less than that seen in Mediterranean environments, where many species survived extremes of cold or aridity and evolved in multiple refuges, or than that seen along the mountain ranges that divide north from south (Cameron, Pokryszko & Horsák, 2010). Native molluscan faunas in the north are largely made up of forest-dwelling species, with forest being the dominant Holocene habitat before human intervention.
The mountain ranges involved have many endemic species. Although many of these are not typically species of forest, the forest faunas of the mountains also contain species with limited distributions. Recent movement north involved some, but not all, of the species in these faunas, and directions and speed of spread are not uniform. Cameron et al. (2010) detected a western bias in origin of species spread across the North European Plain.
In the northern Carpathian chain stretching from the Sudetes in the west to Transcarpathian Ukraine in the east, there is a faunal turnover reflecting the existence of multiple refuges to the south (Cameron et al., 2010). The Carpathians continue into Romania, first in a southerly direction, then westerly, merging with the mountains of Serbia and Bulgaria, and approaching the presumed Mediterranean and south Balkan refugia more closely. This north-westerly portion of Romania constitutes the distinctive Transylvanian region. Palaeobotanical studies show that, although the region was unglaciated at the Last Glacial Maximum, surviving forests tended towards the boreal, and may have been discontinuous in distribution (Feurdean et al., 2007).
The known land snail fauna of Romania (234 species, excluding slugs) is considerably larger than those of countries further north, despite the fact that some are larger in area (Wiktor, 2004; Bank, 2010 and personal communication). There are many restricted endemics, and many species are polytypic within the national borders (Grossu, 1984, 1993). In the present study, we report on a set of Transylvanian forest faunas that were sampled to determine the nature of faunal change at the south-eastern end of the Carpathian chain. In particular, we aimed to determine whether the rate of faunal turnover was higher than further north, whether it was geographically struc-
tured, and the extent to which this was influenced by species absent from more northerly regions. We make direct comparisons with the faunas from the northern Carpathians reported by Cameron et al. (2010), and also with the faunas of countries around Romania.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Samples were made in sites clustered in seven sampling areas within mountainous parts of Transylvania (Fig. 1), from the region of Bistra (Maramures ̧ Mountains) in the north-east to the Retezat National Park in the south-west. Samples from Apuseni, Gilau, and Fenes come from the Bihor massif away from the line of the Carpathians and the Transylvanian Alps. Although the natural forest cover within the range of altitudes examined (approximately 400–1100 m a.s.l.) is mixed broadleaf, much of this has been replaced with managed conifer plantations, mainly Norway Spruce Picea abies. Sample sites were placed where patches of deciduous forest had survived.
At each site, snails from an area of approximately 400 m2 were collected by hand within approximately 4 h of searching; in addition, approximately 20 L of litter was collected and sieved through 10-mm mesh sieves (Cameron & Pokryszko, 2005). Larger specimens were removed from the sieve, and material passing through the sieve was bagged, dried, and then sorted in the laboratory. Slugs were not collected systematically; this method is not appropriate for obtaining a full inventory (Cameron & Pokryszko, 2005). At each site, location and altitude were determined by the Global Positioning System. The dominance and occurrence of trees and some other plants were noted, as well as slope and rock type. Details are provided in the Supporting information (Table S1). To describe climates of the individual sites, bioclimatic data were obtained from WORLDCLIM, version 1.4 (http://www.worldclim.org/). This is a set of 19 global climate layers (bioclimate grids, including means and yearly dynamics of temperature and precipitation) with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 (Hijmans et al., 2005). Site values were obtained from estimates using ARCGIS, version 8.3 (ESRI, 2003).
All living and empty but fresh shells were identified to species as far as possible. Very eroded shells and unidentifiable juveniles were excluded. For consistency, the nomenclature of Bank (2010) was used; authorities are given in the Supporting information (Table S2). We note that this differs in some cases from the checklist of Romanian molluscs provided by Grossu (1993). Representative samples of species are deposited in the Museum of Natural History, Wrocław, and at the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu.
Sampling efficiency (the completeness of inventories at each site) was assessed by using the

Chao 1 estimator of missing species (Southwood & Henderson, 2000) because this appears to be one of the most reliable estimators (Walther & Moore, 2005; Gotelli & Colwell, 2011). Because standard errors of this estimator are very large when the number of singletons and doubletons are small, we have used median values within each sampling area as overall estimators of missing species (Cameron et al., 2010).
The abundances of each species were logtransformed as y = log (N + 1) to reduce the influence of dominant species and to expose the major compositional gradients in the data. First, the samples were subjected to detrended correspondence analysis to assess the length of the main gradient in snail assemblages. A length of 1.9 SD units indicated that ordination techniques based on a linear response model are most appropriate (ter Braak & Šmilauer 2002). We therefore used principal components analysis (PCA) for ordination. We chose an indirect gradient analysis because the study did not set out to test specific hypotheses, and no guarantee can be given that all relevant factors associated with each major compositional gradient have been measured (Økland, 1996). To explain the gradients in the species data,
the correlations with geographical, climate, and environmental variables were examined using Spearman correlations (RS) with site scores on the first four PCA axes. Further, redundancy analysis was used to identify the major geographical and environmental factors accounting for variance in the matrix. CANOCO, version 4.5 (ter Braak & Šmilauer, 2002) was used for ordination techniques and STATISTICA, version 7 (Hill & Lewicki, 2007) was used for uni-dimensional analyses. Sequential Bonferroni corrections of the significance level were used for multiple comparisons of environmental variables (Holm, 1979). Further analyses use the Simpson index of similarity (Koleff, Gaston & Lennon, 2003) both between sites and between aggregate sampling area faunas. The Simpson index disregards abundance and counteracts the effects of differing richness among sites and sampling areas.

individuals were found. The location, altitude, habitat, and composition of each sample, together with names and authorities for each species, are listed in the Supporting information (Tables S1 and S2). Site locations are shown in Figure 1. Summary data are shown in Table 1, allocating sites to sampling areas by location (see below). Numbers of individuals varied considerably between sites, in some cases being less than ten times the number of species, which is the minimum recommended by Cameron & Pokryszko (2005), and there is a positive correlation between numbers of individuals and species among samples (R = 0.56, P < 0.001). Two species are represented in the whole array by single individuals. Although this suggests that species have been missed in some samples, the Chao 1 estimator of missing species gives varying estimates among samples (data not shown), although the mean or median values of the estimator across samples and sampling areas indicate that only one or two species are missing, on average, from each sample. Values of the estimator do not correlate with the number of species recorded. We use the observed numbers and occurrences of species without correction, noting that any correction cannot indicate which species might be missing from any sample.
PATTERNS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Figure 2 shows the positions of sites on the first two axes of a PCA ordination. Table 2 lists the significant Spearman correlation coefficients (RS) of geographical and environmental variables with each axis after Bonferroni correction. Although there are overlaps among the sampling areas, positions on the first two axes indicate that both location (longitude) and climate are both important determinants of faunal similarity when relative abundance is included. Using redundancy analysis with Monte Carlo permutation tests, we found out that longitude (11.7%), Bio6, the

mean minimum temperature of coldest month (10.4%) and Bio15, the seasonal variance in precipitation (9.4%), explain major and similar proportions of variation in the data; however, these variables are strongly correlated with each other. We note that samples from Bicaz and Predeal (predominantly on limestone, and eastern) are distinct from the rest, and are also richer in both species and individuals. Hence, both site species richness and abundance correlate positively with longitude (richness, R = 0.57, P < 0.001; abundance, R = 0.44, P < 0.010). These results, together with those reported below, are used as a basis for analyses based on the faunas of sampling areas in addition to those based on individual site faunas.

 abundance, we further analyzed the data using a matrix of the Simpson index of similarity. Analysis of within and among sampling area values of the site-by-site values of the Simpson index (Table 3) shows that similarity within designated sampling areas is greater than between them, and we use the aggregate faunas of each for some further analyses (area-by-area Simpson index; Table 4).
DISTANCE DECAY AND UNIQUE SPECIES
No distance between sites in the same sampling area exceeds 60 km and no distance between sites in dif-

ferent sampling areas is less than 61 km. A Mantel test of the relationship between distance and site-bysite Simpson similarity overall shows a significant negative relationship (R = -0.41, P < 0.001). If all within sampling area comparisons are removed (retaining distances of 61 to 360 km), R falls to -0.11, explaining only approximately 1% of variation in the data. The Simpson index of similarity shows no significant relationship to distance between sampling areas either for mean site-by-site (R = -0.22, d.f. = 19) or for area-by-area indices (R = -0.02, d.f. = 19). Although there are differences in the number of species found in different sampling areas (Table 1), very few are unique to any one area (Table 5). Among these, seven out of the sixteen are species with wide European distributions. Their presence is influenced by chance or by ecological differences among the sampling areas, mainly in terms of altitude or the presence of wooded wetland.

We make a detailed comparison with the faunas of Polish and Ukrainian forests sampled in the same way and over a similar span of distances.

areas as defined by Cameron et al. (2010) have been split to make the numbers of sites in each more comparable to those in the present study. The Polish/ Ukrainian faunas show a trend for decreasing similarity with the Romanian faunas with distance. Consideration of both lowland and mountain faunas to the north shows that geographical distance is not the only factor involved; distance decay is more rapid in a westerly than in a north-south line. By contrast (Table 7) the relationships of Romanian faunas to those from further north appear weakly related to distance; a very high proportion of the faunas of all areas are held in common with the north. Although Bistra has the greatest proportion of its fauna in common with the north in aggregate, individual sam-
pling area comparisons (data not shown) reveal that the highest between-area Simpson index (92%) is between Predeal and Bieszczady. Predeal is one of the furthest from any northern area, and is the richest overall. These figures, which are based on samples, underestimate the high degree of faunal similarity among these forest faunas. Of the 22 species recorded that are not found in the Polish/Ukrainian Carpathian sites, six are known from other studies in Poland (Wiktor, 2004).
We lack the same kind of datasets for faunas in other directions. An indication of change can be obtained by determining the number of species recorded in our samples that are also recorded in recent faunal lists for the whole or parts of neigh-

bouring countries (Table 8). Far more species recorded by ourselves are found to the north than to the south, even when distances are comparable.
DISCUSSION
The snail faunas of the Transylvanian forests sampled in the present study show a range of local richness very similar to that recorded for similar forests further north (Cameron et al., 2010). They share many species with the northern forests and, indeed, there is little evidence that distance from Polish/Ukrainian sampling areas along the Carpathian ridge affects the degree of similarity. Although faunas within a sampling area tend to be more alike than those among such areas, there is no evidence that differences among the sampling areas relate to distance between them. In general, similarities are high, and differences tend to reflect ecological

factors that affect the numbers of both species and individuals.
The recorded fauna (83 species) constitutes only a small proportion of the known Romanian land snail fauna (234 species) and, given the low intensity of sampling in the country and the large number of subspecies described (Grossu, 1993; Bank, 2010), even this proportion may be biased upwards. Grossu (1984) estimated that approximately 40% of the non-marine mollusc fauna of the country had Central or Northern European affinities. In our samples, the proportion is approximately 80% and, when comparisons are made with the recorded faunas of neighbouring countries, it is evident that relationships with the north are far stronger than with the south. Although a number of Romanian endemics are recorded from within Transylvania, most (e.g. Alopia or Agardhiella species) are typical of very rocky or high-altitude habitats above the zone of mixed forests sampled in the present study (Grossu, 1984). The maps in Grossu (1981) show the minute scales of some species ranges in Alopia. Our sample areas do not include the Banat, between Retezat and the Serbian border, which is the restricted location of many species endemic to Romania or recorded elsewhere only in Serbia, Croatia or Bulgaria (Grossu, 1984).
Thus, although it is certain that more intensive sampling would increase the number of species known from within the range of habitats sampled in the present study, the evidence suggests that these faunas are mainly a subset of those known throughout the Carpathians, and also that, from Transcarpathian Ukraine southwards, there is not the marked pattern of geographical turnover seen along the west to east line of the Sudetes-Carpathian ridge. Cameron et al. (2010) related that turnover to multiple refuges to the south because, within the Transcarpathian Basin, and even further west,

 coniferous forests were present through the last glacial episode (Willis & van Andel, 2004; Jankovská & Pokorný, 2008). The same applies to Romania: although there is evidence of steppe vegetation, conifers were certainly present in the Late Glacial, even at relatively high altitudes (approximately 900 m a.s.l.), together with small numbers of Alnus and Ulmus trees (Björkman etal., 2002; Tantau etal., 2006; Feurdean etal., 2007). Holocene spread of other deciduous trees (Quercus, Tilia, and Corylus) occurred earlier than in the west. Although there are no described late glacial mollusc faunas from Transylvania, the evidence from further west suggests that some elements of the present forest fauna were present at or near the last glacial maximum (Ložek, 2006). Our samples come from the extreme southeastern end of the mountain ranges that separate northern and southern Europe. Nevertheless, only a few species have distributions suggesting local differentiation within the Pleistocene.
To the east, there is either the Black Sea or the lowlands of eastern Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, which were certainly steppe at the Last Glacial Maximum (Atanassova, 2005). The nearest mountains are those of the Crimea, which is isolated and located 650 km east of the nearest Romanian mountains. Here, there are only a maximum of 29 species in common with the faunas recorded in the present study (Sysoev & Shileyko, 2009), and all are species that are widely distributed in northern central Europe. Many of these extend as far east as the Ural Mountains (Horsák et al., 2010). The contrast with the very isolated forest faunas of Transcaucasia is marked (Pokryszko et al., 2011). Here mixed forests persisted throughout the Pleistocene, and local differentiation has built up a rich endemic fauna with marked local differences. Over a similar range of distances, the mean site-by-site Simpson index is 41.4% ± 0.9 compared to 59.8% ± 0.4 for the Transylvanian sites; some site faunas have no species in common, whereas the lowest index values within the Transylvanian set are all above 30%. Even at the southern limit of our sampling, forest faunas reflect movement or cohesion over considerable distances at the beginning of the Holocene. They do not reflect either the development of many allopatric endemics typical of areas where forest faunas are periodically isolated by the onset of aridity, nor the slow build-up of regional diversity seen in lower latitude faunas where forest faunas persist over millions, rather than tens of thousands of years (Cameron et al., 2005; Pokryszko et al., 2011). This pattern in forest faunas clearly differs from that seen in other habitats in the same region; faunal composition and turnover reflect the different histories of persistence and fragmentation in each.

Miklos Szekeres helped us determine difficult identifications among the Clausiliid species. Ruud Bank very kindly made available an easily-touse version of the Fauna Europaea list of land and freshwater Mollusca, and listed the Romanian species for us. Ondrˇej Hájek prepared the map of the sites. Manuscript preparation by M. Horsák was supported by a grant from the Czech Ministry of Education (project no. MSM 0021622416) and the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (project no. P504/10/0688).
