Abstract
Reproduction by workers is rare in honey bee colonies that have an active queen. By not producing their own offspring and preventing other workers from producing theirs, workers are thought to increase their inclusive fitness due to their higher average relatedness towards queen-produced male offspring compared with worker-produced male offspring. But there is one exception. Workers of the Cape honey bee, Apis mellifera capensis, are able to produce diploid female offspring via thelytokous parthenogenesis and thus produce clones of themselves. As a result, worker reproduction and tolerance towards worker-produced offspring is expected to be more permissive than in arrhenotokous (sub)species where worker offspring are male. Here we quantify the extent to which A. m. capensis workers contribute to reproduction in queenright colonies using microsatellite analyses of pre-emergent brood. We show that workers produced 10.5% of workers and 0.48% of drones. Most of the workers’ contribution towards the production of new workers coincided with the colonies producing new queens during reproductive swarming.

Introduction
A defining characteristic of insect societies is reproductive division of labour with workers not normally producing their own offspring in the presence of a queen. This is despite the fact that in most species, workers are capable of laying eggs that develop into viable males, and will do so if queenless (Bourke 1988). The prevailing theory explaining such ‘altruistic’ worker behaviour is inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton 1964a, b). However, while inclusive fitness theory can explain why individuals may act altruistically in most instances, it also predicts the potential for conflicts over reproduction because insect societies are rarely comprised of clones. Thus, the potential for conflict is always present within insect societies as the reproductive optima of colony members hardly, if ever, completely overlap (Beekman & Ratnieks 2003).
The regulation of worker reproduction may be mediated through various mechanisms, including dominance hierarchies in small societies (Fletcher & Ross 1985), queen

pheromones (Free 1987; Wossler & Crewe 1999) and brood pheromones (Arnold et al. 1994). Queen pheromones were originally thought to operate as coercive agents that suppress worker reproduction (e.g. Free 1987). Alternatively, pheromones may operate as honest signals that indicate the presence and quality of the queen (Keller & Nonacs 1993). The competing explanations of functional worker sterility continue to receive attention (e.g. Ratnieks & Wenseleers 2007; Strauss et al. 2008), but as yet definitive experimental evidence to discriminate between the explanations remains elusive. Nonetheless, whatever the mechanism, the effect of queen and brood pheromones is that honey bee workers do not normally activate their ovaries in the presence of a queen (Mohammedi et al. 1998).
In polyandrous species such as honey bees (Apis), an additional mechanism for controlling selfish behaviour by individual workers is worker policing via the selective removal of worker-laid eggs (Ratnieks 1988). In arrhenotokous populations, in which workers lay haploid eggs that may result in males, workers are more related to the sons produced by the queen (relatedness = 0.25) than to the average worker-produced son (r ~ 0.125) (Ratnieks 1988). As a result, workers can, in theory, increase their inclusive

fitness (Hamilton 1964a, b) by refraining from individual reproduction (Wenseleers et al. 2004) and by removing any eggs laid by workers (Ratnieks & Visscher 1989). However, an individual worker would still benefit from producing her own sons while preventing her sisters from doing the same. Thus facultative worker sterility is only likely to evolve in the presence of an effective policing system because policing makes any individual attempts to reproduce fruitless (Wenseleers et al. 2004). Worker policing is well documented in several species of Apis (A. mellifera, Ratnieks & Visscher 1989; A. florea, Halling et al. 2001; A. cerana, Oldroyd et al. 2001) and is also found in other polyandrous social insects (Foster & Ratnieks 2001; Foster et al. 2002a; Wenseleers et al. 2005a, b; Wenseleers & Ratnieks 2006), as well as in monandrous species when worker reproduction is costly (Monnin & Peeters 1997; Arevalo et al. 1998; Foster et al. 2002b; Endler et al. 2004).
In the Cape honey bee (Apis mellifera capensis) from South Africa, workers are able to produce diploid offspring via thelytokous parthenogenesis (Onions 1914; Lundie 1954; Anderson 1963). The shift to thelytoky has important consequences for the kin structure of colonies, many of which favour worker reproduction (Greeff 1996b). This is because workers are related to their own female-producing eggs by unity and so workers are similarly related to the female progeny of their sister-workers (r ~ 0.25) as they are to the progeny of their queen. Thus, workers of A. m. capensis are predicted to be more tolerant of reproduction by their sisters in colonies with a queen than are arrhentokous workers of all other honey bee subspecies and species (Hamilton 1972; Greeff 1996b).
It has frequently been asserted that worker reproduction is a normal phenomenon in queenright A. m. capensis colonies (Neumann & Hepburn 2002; Härtel et al. 2006). However, only Moritz et al. (1999) have unequivocally demonstrated the presence of worker-produced offspring in A. m. capensis, and this was in a single colony. In contrast, Härtel et al. (2006) failed to find any worker-produced worker brood among small samples taken from three colonies. Furthermore, studies of worker policing have found variable results in A. m. capensis (Beekman et al. 2002; Calis, Boot & Allsopp 2003; Pirk et al. 2003), most likely because not all colonies used were of ‘pure’ A. m. capensis stock but mixtures of A. m. capensis and the arrhenotokous Apis mellifera scutellata (Beekman et al. 2002; Beekman & Oldroyd 2008). Colonies comprised of mixtures of A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata genotypes are predicted to exhibit higher rates of worker policing than ‘pure’ colonies of A. m. capensis (Beekman et al. 2002; Beekman & Oldroyd 2008).
In this study, we quantify worker reproduction in ‘pure’ colonies (see Materials and Methods) of queenright A. m. capensis of both workerand drone-brood using microsatellite analysis. Although A. m. capensis workers are thought to produce diploid offspring exclusively, this has not yet
been explicitly investigated. We used colonies that were actively producing new queens in preparation for reproductive swarming, as we expected worker reproduction to be at its highest during this period (Jordan et al. 2008).
Materials and methods
Colonies
Apis mellifera capensis used in this study were unselected colonies typical of A. m. capensis found around Stellenbosch, Western Cape (33°56′S, 18°51′E). Stellenbosch is in the centre of the ‘pure’ A. m. capensis zone and hundreds of kilometres from the boundary of the areas of introgression of arrhenotokous Apis mellifera scutellata (Hepburn & Crewe 1991; Hepburn et al. 1994). Eight colonies (the same as used in Jordan et al. (2008)) were headed by open-mated queens. The colonies were moved to a honey flow arising from cultivated canola (Brassica napa) near Malmsbury, Western Cape (33°27′S, 18°43′E), in July 2006. These environmental conditions greatly increase population growth. Because colonies were constrained to a single Langstroth box, the worker population quickly outgrew the space available in their hive. As a result, the workers started to produce queen cells in preparation for reproductive swarming.
The offspring of a queen and the clonal offspring of one of her workers can share the same genotype. Thus, to allow us to distinguish queen-laid and worker-laid offspring, we manipulated the swarming colonies such that each colony’s queen was not related to the workers. To do this, we either swapped brood between pairs of colonies every 3 weeks starting 12 weeks before harvesting the first brood (four colonies) or swapped the queens (four colonies) between pairs of colonies. Such swapping of brood or queens is common practice in beekeeping (Morse 1990) and no adverse effects have been reported.
Sampling dates of pre-emerging workers (PEW) and preemerging drones (PED) are given in Table 1. Timing of PED collection depended on the presence of sufficient sealed drone brood.
Genotyping
We obtained DNA using a standard Chelex extraction method (Walsh et al. 1991; Oldroyd et al. 1997). Tissue from wingtips (queens), hindlegs (pupae) or the abdominal region (larvae) was collected. We screened 17 Apis mellifera microsatellite markers used in previous parentage analysis studies for polymorphism and efficient amplification. Four microsatellite loci were used for PEW and six for PED (chosen from Am005, Am14, Am46, Am52, Am059, Am061 (Solignac et al. 2003). Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions were used (Estoup et al. 1994). PCR products (1.2 μL) from each multiplex reaction were added to 10 μL

formamide and 100 nL LIZ DNA size standard (Applied Biosystems). Samples were run on a 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems), with capillary length 36 cm and injection time of 15 s at 1200 V, for 41 min. Resultant data files were analysed using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems) and genotypes for each individual constructed.
If an individual is the offspring of the resident queen, both must share at least one allele at each locus. Hence, individuals were determined to be non-queen laid if they did not share an allele with the resident queen at a locus. Individuals were classed as being foreign laid if they did not share alleles with either the resident queen or resident worker consensus genotypes at a locus. When less than two loci amplified in any individual, we did not assign its maternity to either queen or worker.
Results
We genotyped 911 PEW from our eight colonies. A total of 84 workers were produced by workers natal to their colony (Table S1, Supporting information). We found an additional 12 workers that could not have been produced by the workers natal to their colony (Table S1, colony 8). Total contribution by workers to PEW was thus 10.5% (Table 1). Three of the 618 PED genotyped could not be attributed to the queen of the colony (one in colony 1 and two in colony 6; see Table S2, Supporting information), resulting in 0.48% of drones being produced by workers (Table 1). Thus, total worker reproduction equals 6.9%. All but colony 1 produced queen cells. The queen of colony 7 was no longer seen after August 2; hence, this colony was most likely queenless after this date. Rates of worker reproduction were significantly different among colonies (Table 1; χ72 = 106.2, P < 0.001).
When we split our sampling periods into pre-reproductive (before the first appearance of queen cells, or before the loss of a queen) and reproductive (after first queen cells or queen loss) phases, we see that the rate of worker reproduction increases significantly once colonies were raising new queens (Table 2; χ12 = 141.8, P < 0.001).

Discussion
Including the contributions of non-natal workers, a total of 10.5% of PEW (Table 1 and Table S1) were found to be worker produced. Perhaps surprisingly, we also found that three PEDs (0.48%) were produced by workers instead of the queen (Table 1 and Table S2). The mode of parthenogenesis in Apis mellifera capensis is thought to be controlled by a single locus, and thelytokous parthenogenesis is recessive to arrhenotokous parthenogenesis (Lattorff et al. 2005). The mothers of those drones may have been heterozygous at the thelytoky locus due to the presence of rare arrhenotoky alleles in the A. m. capensis population, or the trait may not have complete penetrance.
The frequency of worker reproduction in queenright colonies of A. m. capensis appears to be higher than rates of worker reproduction reported in arrhenotokous populations of A. mellifera, where only 0.12% of males are worker derived (Visscher 1989). A complete absence of successful worker reproduction has been found in the arrhenotokous Asian honey bee species Apis dorsata (Wattanachaiyingcharoen et al. 2001), Apis florea (Halling et al. 2001) and Apis cerana (Oldroyd et al. 2001). Higher rates of worker reproduction in the Cape honey bee accords with predictions from inclusive fitness theory that a thelytokous population of honey bee should be more permissive of worker reproduction than an arrhenotokous population (Hamilton 1972; Greeff 1996a; Beekman & Oldroyd 2008). A total of 1.6% of all workers sampled from our colonies had active ovaries (see supplementary material in Jordan et al. 2008, Table S2). The proportion of workers with active ovaries increased significantly from 0.62% before queen cells were being raised to 2.2% while queen cells were being raised (reanalysed from Table S2, Jordan et al. 2008; χ12 = 15.57, P < 0.001). This suggests that the increase in the proportion of worker-produced offspring found when queen cells are being produced is due to an increase in rates of worker oviposition and not to a decrease in worker policing. Previous studies on A. mellifera have found rates of ovary activation of 1% (Visscher 1996) and 0.07% (Ratnieks 1993). However, comparisons with arrhenotokous subspecies are of limited value, as no previous study has examined rates of worker reproduction during colony reproduction.
An overlooked property of the expected permissiveness of worker reproduction in A. m. capensis is that the production of daughter workers is not likely to increase an individual worker’s fitness. Eggs laid by a worker of an arrhenotokous (sub)species develop into viable drones that have some probability of mating with a virgin queen. But for an A. m. capensis worker to increase her direct fitness by personal reproduction, the worker would need to become the mother of the next queen, not a worker (Beekman & Oldroyd 2008; Boot et al. 2008). The production of new queens by A. m. capensis workers is a real option because there are no
genetic differences between queens and workers in honey bees: caste is determined solely by nutrition (Wilde de & Beetsma 1982).
Genetic analysis of all queen-destined larvae and pupae that were produced by our study colonies showed that the majority of new queens were indeed offspring of workers and not the resident queens ( Jordan et al. 2008). In addition, our current data reveal that A. m. capensis workers do not contribute to the production of new workers at a constant high rate. In fact, our results suggest that high levels of worker reproduction only occur when colonies are actively producing new queens (Table 2). This may be because A. m. capensis workers are only reproductively active during this reproductive phase because this is the only period when queen cells are likely to be available, and hence the reward for worker reproduction is sufficient. Alternatively, worker reproduction may be largely limited to the reproductive phase by a relaxation of worker reproductive inactivation, be it voluntary (Keller & Nonacs 1993) or enforced (Fletcher & Ross 1985), brought about by colony changes associated with swarming (Winston 1979). Whatever the proximate mechanism that regulate worker reproduction, our results show that even when within-colony relatedness remains the same, the expected fitness gains of producing one’s own offspring differs depending on the season.
Our data also show high variation in rates of worker reproduction among colonies: in four of eight colonies, no worker-produced offspring were found even though queens were being reared in three of those colonies. The cause of this variation is unknown. It could arise because workers in some colonies are more able to activate their ovaries once queen cells are being produced, or due to variation in policing rates among colonies (Beekman et al. 2002). The queen in colony 7 was not seen after August 2 and this colony contained parasitic workers that produced all new workers (N = 12) after the queen was lost. High rates of worker reproduction while new queens are being reared, combined with the fact that the majority of new queens are offspring of workers and not the queen ( Jordan et al. 2008) shows that workers indeed (successfully) compete both with the old queen and their sisters over the production of queens (Beekman & Oldroyd 2008).
Even though kin selection theory predicts that in thelytokous populations, workers should make a significant contribution to reproduction, we suggest that queenright colonies of A. m. capensis behave in a rather similar way to arrhenotokous honey bees. Worker reproduction outside a colony’s reproductive period is unlikely to increase a worker’s fitness, even if she is thelytokous. Moreover, the constant presence of reproductively active workers is likely to have a negative effect on colony success both in thelytokous (Hillesheim et al. 1989) and arrhenotokous (Barron, Oldroyd & Ratnieks 2001) populations. Hence, both the individual worker’s as well as the colony’s interests are
