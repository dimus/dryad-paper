ABSTRACT
Aim We examine diversification in Caribbean alsophiine snakes and hypothesize that, given the ecological opportunity presented by colonization of the West Indies, alsophiines should show the signature of an early burst of diversification and associated low within-clade ecological and morphological disparification. We also test whether changes in morphology and ecology are associated with changes in diversification rate, as trait-dependent diversification is hypothesized to affect historical inferences of diversification and disparification. Finally, as replicated radiations are found across the West Indies in the anoles, we test for significant differences in ecological and morphological assemblages and rates among the major island groups.
Location The West Indies.
Methods A time-calibrated phylogeny produced from six genes using relaxed clock methods in beast was constructed to estimate ancestral areas using Lagrange. Maximum body size and ecological niche were scored for all species in the phylogeny, and comparative phylogenetic methods in R using geiger, laser, ape and our own code were used to examine diversification through time, disparification and trait-dependent diversification from this dated phylogeny.
Results The pattern of species diversification did not differ significantly from the Yule model of diversification. Morphology and ecology fitted a Brownian and white noise model of diversification, respectively. Although not significantly different, morphological disparification was lower than the Brownian null model, whereas ecological disparification was significantly greater than the null. Traitdependent diversification analyses suggested that the constant null models provided the best fit to these data. There was no significant signal of rate variation among the major island groups for size, but moderate evidence for niche.
Main conclusions Although ecological opportunity was similarly present for alsophiines as it was for anoles, the snakes fail to show an early burst of speciation. Potential reasons for this include the young age of the group, and staggered diversification due to waiting times between island colonization. In turn, ecological and morphological disparities do not necessarily follow predictable patterns related to species diversification. Thus, the presence of ecological opportunity alone is not necessarily sufficient to trigger replicated adaptive radiations in areas.

F. T. Burbrink et al. INTRODUCTION
An adaptive radiation is identified as the rapid diversification of descendants from a common ancestor into open niche space. This is typically thought to be triggered when a lineage encounters significant ecological opportunity generated by: (1) the colonization of new areas, (2) the extinction of competitors, or (3) the development of a key innovation (Simpson, 1953; Schluter, 2000; Losos, 2010; Yoder et al., 2010). Many of the most famous examples of adaptive radiation come from islands, such as finches in the Galapagos, or Anolis lizards in the West Indies, where invasion of an island system has led to the development of numerous species with different ecomorphologies, each with adaptations to exploit various habitats and trophic niches along gradients of ecological space (Losos & Ricklefs, 2009). One particular insight gained from studying diversification on islands in anoles is that a distinct set of ecomorphs is replicated on major islands, having evolved in situ on each from a single colonization event (Losos et al., 1998). This suggests that deterministic processes may drive adaptive radiations, at least in part, yielding similar outcomes when similar niches are invaded in geographically distinct areas (Schluter, 2000).
The specific outcome of an adaptive radiation, such as the particular Anolis ecomorphs, may be unique to those individual groups (Losos, 2009). However, the general pattern of rapid radiation yielding a variety of species and ecomorphs may be general to a region given ecological opportunity, even if different groups produce different kinds of ecomorphs. Thus, for any area where ecological opportunity is present, we can ask if multiple groups in that region show characteristic signs of adaptive radiation. If unrelated groups demonstrate similar patterns of adaptive radiation, this suggests that these patterns may be commonly replicated in areas containing similar spectra of open niche space, providing a general biogeographical outline for exceptional speciation. However, there have been relatively few tests of adaptive radiation across multiple unrelated groups in regions known to present significant ecological opportunity. Rigorous tests on the tempo and mode of diversification through time regarding speciation, morphology and ecological niche are therefore required across groups inhabiting the same region in order to understand the generality of ecological opportunity.
If ecological opportunity was present at the origin of the group, the rate of diversification is likely to be elevated early and to decrease later as niches become saturated with competitors (Rabosky & Lovette, 2008a). In taxa that experience early bursts of diversification, the partitioning of morphological disparity through time, also known as disparification (Evans et al., 2009), is likely to be low, indicating that individuals within subclades are similar to each other, yet distinct from those of other clades (Harmon et al., 2003, 2008a; Kozak et al., 2005; Burbrink & Pyron, 2010). Ecological disparification should show similar patterns, as morphological adaptations often correspond to ecological diversification (Luxbacher & Knouft, 2009). In the West
466
Indies, Anolis lizards represent the classic scenario, whereby ecological opportunity resulting from island colonization resulted in early bursts of diversification and morphological disparification, replicated on the major island groups (Harmon et al., 2003; Losos, 2009). Here, we examine diversification and disparification in another diverse Caribbean squamate group – the alsophiine snakes (Henderson & Powell, 2009; Pyron et al., 2011) – to determine if they show a similar pattern to Anolis, indicative of broad-scale geographical replication in the forces leading to adaptive radiation in the West Indies.
Alsophiines are a monophyletic clade of snakes found throughout the West Indies, including both the Greater and the Lesser Antilles (Maglio, 1970; Hedges et al., 2009), and are part of the larger subfamily Dipsadinae, the largest snake radiation in the world (Pyron & Burbrink, 2011; Pyron et al., 2011). They are represented by at least 43 morphologically diverse species that range in maximum size from 207 to 2000 mm, and almost all exhibit striking morphological adaptations to a slender ground-, tree-, or bush-dwelling racer-form body shape (Henderson & Powell, 2009). The dipsadines are likely to have originated in the Oligocene, and the alsophiines diversified after the mid-Miocene (Burbrink & Pyron, 2008; Hedges et al., 2009).
The colonization of the West Indies by alsophiines therefore occurred after the break-up of the hypothesized mid-Cenozoic Aves Ridge (c. 33–35 Ma) or earlier proto-Antillean land masses of the Cretaceous. This suggests a strong role for dispersal throughout the isolated islands of the Greater Antilles and the volcanic islands comprising the Lesser Antilles (Hedges, 2006; Iturralde-Vinent, 2006). For alsophiine snakes, the Caribbean as a whole thus represents a massive, ecologically diverse region, comprising 230,000 km2 of land area (Woods & Sergile, 2001) with almost no competition from other colubrids, which are naturally absent from the Greater Antilles and restricted to a few species in the Lesser Antilles (Henderson & Powell, 2009). Thus, the alsophiines probably encountered significant ecological opportunity, which is associated with adaptive radiation in anoles and numerous other squamates (Harmon et al., 2003; Burbrink & Pyron, 2010).
Here, we address several of the main questions relating to diversification and disparification in order to examine the potential impact of ecological opportunity on the alsophiines. We ask whether, given the possibility of ecological opportunity, alsophiines show the typical pattern of an early burst of diversification. Arising from this, we also ask whether this pattern of diversification is associated with low morphological and ecological disparity. Following from these questions, we determine whether changes in morphology or ecology are associated with changes in diversification rate, as trait-dependent diversification may alternately affect historical inferences of diversification and disparification. Finally, as replicated radiations are found across the Caribbean islands in the anoles, we test for significant differences in ecological and morphological assemblages and rates among the major island groups. In contrast to the case for Anolis, there is little evidence to

suggest that the alsophiines show any exceptional patterns of diversification in the West Indies, or any differences among the major island groups. This study supplies crucial evidence regarding patterns of diversification in the Caribbean with respect to the ties between morphological/ecological disparity and patterns of species diversification, providing an interesting null model for the study of adaptive radiation through ecological opportunity in island regions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Phylogeny, divergence times and ancestral area estimation
To estimate the phylogeny and divergence times, we re-analysed the DNA sequence dataset from Hedges et al. (2009). Of the 43 described alsophiine species, our dataset includes DNA sequences from 35 (81%), and we note that four taxa have gone extinct in modern times (Henderson & Powell, 2009). In addition, our dataset includes the dipsadine outgroups Leptodeira annulata and Heterodon platirhinos, and the colubrine Coluber constrictor (see Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information). Models of substitution were chosen using Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in jModelTest (Posada, 2008) for the following genes used in this study: 12S (313 bp; HKY+C+I), 16S (382 bp; GTR+C+I), cytochrome b (cyt b) (609 bp; GTR+C+I), ND2 (735 bp; GTR+C+I), ND4 (678 bp; GTR+C+I) and RAG2 (678 bp; GTR+C). The final matrix was 3423 bp in length, and all genes represented at least 34 (90%) species, yielding little missing data.
We used the relaxed phylogenetic method implemented in beast 1.6.1 to infer a time-calibrated tree with node support (Drummond et al., 2006; Drummond & Rambaut, 2007). Two analyses were run for 25 million generations using an uncorrelated lognormal rate distribution under a birth–death process. This yielded an estimated sample size (ESS) > 200 (indicating stationarity; Drummond etal., 2006) for all parameters after discarding the first 2.5 million generations as burn-in and combining the runs, for a total of 45 million generations. The XML code for the phylogenetic and divergence dating analyses are available from Dryad: doi:10.5061/ dryad.03kb7.
To produce a chronogram, we used two calibrations with lognormal distribution priors, one at the root of the tree, and the other at the stem-group age of the monophyletic clade of Hypsirhynchus from Jamaica (Hedges et al., 2009). The first was set at a mean of 33 Ma (lognormal = 3.496) and with a lognormal standard deviation (SD) of 0.4 [95% prior credible interval (PCI) = 15–72 Ma], which yields a range equivalent to the likely time horizon of the family Colubridae (Burbrink & Pyron, 2008; Vidal et al., 2009). The second calibration, with a mean of 10 Ma (lognormal = 2.3) and SD of 0.5 (95% PCI = 3.74–26.58), corresponds to the earliest possible emergence of Jamaica (Iturralde-Vinent, 2006; Hedges et al., 2009). These priors are equivalent to previous analyses (Hedges et al., 2009). To better understand the progression of the coloniza-

tion of islands, we used Lagrange 2.01 (Ree et al., 2005; Ree & Smith, 2008) to estimate ancestral areas across the timecalibrated tree. Species were coded to one of six regions: Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the Lesser Antilles and the mainland (for the outgroup species only). The root was fixed at the mainland, ancestral areas and dispersal probabilities were unconstrained, and rates of dispersal and extinction were constant and equal among areas (but see Rabosky & Glor, 2010 for a discussion of more complex biogeographical models).
Species diversification through time
We used the time-calibrated tree to test for the signal of early explosive diversification in the alsophiines. Using the R packages (R Development Core Team, 2011) ape, geiger and laser (Paradis et al., 2004; Rabosky, 2006; Harmon et al., 2008b), we calculated a number of statistics associated with tree shape. We first generated a lineage-through-time (LTT) plot, and calculated the lineage diversification index (LDI) indicating the deviation of the empirical LTT line from the expectation under a pure-birth process (Harmon et al., 2003). We also generated the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the LTT line under the empirical pure-birth process to determine if the observed LDI was significant through time (e.g. Rabosky & Lovette, 2008a). The code for performing these analyses in R is available on request from R.A.P. While these analyses do not explicitly account for the missing taxa in the group, they provide a rough estimate for assessing deviations from a purebirth process based on the sampled species (see Burbrink & Pyron, 2010).
Second, we calculated Pybus and Harvey’s c (Pybus & Harvey, 2000) to test for explosive early diversification. This statistic measures the density of ordered inter-node distances on a phylogeny, to determine if they are evenly distributed (c = 0; pure-birth), clustered early (negative c; early burst), or clustered late (positive c; late burst or high early extinction). As the tree represents an incompletely sampled phylogeny (n = 35; see Cusimano & Renner, 2010), we applied the Monte Carlo randomization in the laser package (mccrTest.rd) to generate 5000 null phylogenies produced under a Yule process with the total number of alsophiine taxa (n = 43). This will allow us to determine if the value of c from the incomplete tree differs significantly from the null expectation compared to the randomized values generated by trimming fully sampled trees. Errors can also arise from under-parameterized models of sequence evolution (Revell et al., 2005), but we have accounted for this here through rigorous model-testing.
In addition, we determined the empirical distribution of c-values from the completely sampled phylogeny by randomly placing the missing taxa within the clade of affiliated genera. The mccrTest.rd procedure in laser assumes that the placement of taxa throughout the tree is random and does not take into account phylogenetic affinities (see discussion in Brock et al., 2011), here determined by inclusion into existing genera.

Our strategy places each missing taxon onto a branch within its genus. For instance, given one missing species of Arrhyton from our analysis, Arrhyton ainictum, our code would randomly place it on a branch within the clade of existing Arrhyton, with the probability of placement weighted by branch length, including the stem group. This procedure was conducted 100 times simultaneously for all missing taxa: Alsophis antiguae, Alsophis sanctonum, Arrhyton ainictum, Borikenophis sanctaecrucis, Hypsirhynchus ater, Hypsirhynchus melanichnus, Ialtris agyrtes and Ialtris parishi. The value of c was then calculated for all 100 trees, and a distribution was constructed to determine if the 95% CI included significantly negative values. The code for performing this procedure in R is available on request from R.A.P.
We also determined if the rate of diversification remained constant over time (Yule process), changed over time according to a twoor three-rate Yule process, or decreased in accordance with either of the two diversity-dependent models (DDL = linear decrease, DDX = exponential decrease), by fitting these models in laser. We also simulated 1000 completely sampled trees under a Yule model and produced a distribution of the differences between the values of the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) of the best rate-constant and best rate-variable models. Our values of these differences were compared with the 95% CI of this distribution to determine if the difference in AIC between our rate-constant and rate-variable models were significantly larger than the distribution of differences produced under the null Yule model (Rabosky & Lovette, 2008a). Finally, we tested three models of diversification using laser: SPVAR permits speciation to vary over time, EXVAR permits extinction to vary over time, and BOTHVAR allows both to vary over time (Rabosky & Lovette, 2008b). However, without additional external information about extinction, results from these models must be interpreted cautiously (Rabosky, 2010).
Morphological and ecological disparification
Ecomorphologically diverse groups of snakes tend to show the greatest difference on a size axis as measured by snout–vent length, SVL (Vitt, 1987; Pyron & Burbrink, 2009a). As snakes have indeterminate growth, we used log-transformed maximum SVL in all species of alsophiine, following values presented in Henderson & Powell (2009). These snakes range in maximum SVL from the miniature Arrhyton vittatum (207 mm) in Cuba to the massive Haitiophis anomalus (2000 mm) in Hispaniola.
For ecological data, we extracted climatic data from the WorldClim dataset, which comprises the 19 BioClim variables that describes averages and seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation at 30-s resolution (Hijmans et al., 2005), from 401 points of all 35 sampled species throughout the West Indies. Occurrences were obtained from museum or published records, primarily from the HerpNet database. Points with GPS data were used ‘as is’; all other records were georeferenced to the locality provided. All localities were examined for
468
concordance with known localities and ranges for the species from the CaribHerp database (http://www.caribherp.org/) and are available in Appendix S1. We performed principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce ecological variation to its primary components (Pyron & Burbrink, 2009b). We used phylogenetically corrected PCA (Revell, 2009) on the correlation matrix of the species means to remove evolutionary dependence from the principal components, excluding BIO3 and BIO7, which are linear combinations of other variables and thus multicollinear.
First, we determined the optimal model of trait evolution for size and niche (PC1) by fitting a series of increasingly complex models (sensu Harmon et al., 2010). We tested Brownian motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck and early burst models, the most commonly tested models for species trait data (see Harmon et al., 2010). As a null model to test for the potential existence of niche conservatism, we also used a white noise model, a non-phylogenetic model in which all species values are drawn from a single multivariate normal distribution with shared mean and variance across species (Sheets & Mitchell, 2001; Hunt, 2007; Kozak & Wiens, 2010). Finally, we implemented a special case of the AC/DC model, which allows Brownian motion rates to increase or decrease exponentially through time (Blomberg et al., 2003). The early burst model is an AC/DC submodel (derived in Harmon et al., 2010) that allows rates to decrease exponentially through time (negative rate parameter r); here, we implemented a model in which rates increase exponentially (positive r), producing a ‘late burst’ model of trait evolution. For both size and niche, we chose the model with the lowest AICc value. The code for testing the late burst model in R is available in Appendix S2.
Second, we examined morphological and ecological disparity partitioning through time (DTT) by modifying the code in geiger (Harmon et al., 2008b). Disparity was calculated using the average squared Euclidean distance among all pairs of points in our trees for log-transformed SVL and PC1 of ecological niche. The values from our estimated tree were compared with a null model composed of 1000 simulations under multivariate Brownian motion. The trend for alsophiines was compared against this null model by calculating the morphological (or ecological) disparity index (MDI/EDI). This provides a measure of divergence from the median line of the null model, with positive values indicating that disparity is greater than expected and negative values indicating that disparity is less than expected. Negative disparity indicates that morphological and ecological variation is partitioned among subclades, each of which occupies a distinct island in state space. Disparity values significantly greater than the null suggest that subclades overlap, and all contain a significant proportion of variation found throughout the entire group at a given time. The code was altered to derive 95% CIs from the null simulations around the median estimates, and to calculate the 95% CI from the posterior distribution of trees (100 samples). This permits us to determine if DTT is significantly higher or lower than the null model, as well as whether the variability in the posterior distribution represents a significant
Journal of Biogeography 39, 465–475 a 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

portion of the total variance. The code for performing this test is available on request from R.A.P.
Third, to determine if different island groups produce significantly different morphological or ecological assemblages, we used SVL and ecological niche (PC1) data to conduct a phylogenetic ANOVA, where the grouping variable was defined as the five major West Indies island groups defined in the ancestral area analyses (Garland et al., 1993; Harmon et al., 2008b). This method reduces inflated degrees of freedom by accounting for phylogenetic history and producing a null test distribution based on 1000 simulated sets of dependent variables under a Brownian motion model. If island groups differed significantly, this would indicate that the island groups of different area, and presumably varying niche space, produced different ecomorphological assemblages, as is observed in the anoles (Losos et al., 1998; Losos & Schluter, 2000).
We also tested for significant differences in rates of evolution in size and niche among the major island groups. We present a simple test for biogeographical variation in rates, analogous to the censored-rates test of BROWNIE (O’Meara et al., 2006). We created pruned subtrees containing only the taxa in each of the five major island groups (Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico), and fit separate Brownian motion models for size and niche to each subtree. The likelihoods for these subtrees were summed and compared with the single-rate Brownian motion model for each trait using AICc. This test compares a model in which rates vary among regions with a model in which they are biogeographically invariant. The code for this test is available in Appendix S2.
Trait-dependent diversification
Finally, we tested for trait-dependent diversification related to body size and ecological niche in the alsophiines using the recently developed Quantitative State Speciation and Extinction (QuaSSE) algorithm (FitzJohn, 2010), implemented in the R package diversitree. This algorithm takes a phylogeny and set of trait measurements for the tip species, and fits a series of birth–death models in which the speciation and extinction probabilities vary along branches as a function of the trait values. This allows for a comparison of models in which diversification and trait evolution are independent with those in which rates of diversification are directly affected by trait values. We used the log-transformed measurements of maximum body size (SVL) and ecological niche (PC1) for the 35 alsophiine species, with a generic SD of 1/20 (see FitzJohn, 2010), and the proportion of sampled species (0.81), to account for missing taxa. We fitted models in which speciation rates were a constant, linear, sigmoidal, and hump-shaped function of body size and niche. These were compared using AIC values to determine the best-fit model for the data. Starting values for optimizations were the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of initial rates and parameters, and mean trait values. Given issues with power for detecting and estimating extinction from molecular phylogenies (FitzJohn, 2010; Rabosky, 2010), we did not test extinction-variable models.

RESULTS
Phylogeny, divergence times and ancestral areas
The tree topology, support and dates are all highly concordant with previous analyses (Hedges et al., 2009), which justifies previous taxonomic conclusions (Fig. 1). The origin and diversification of the alsophiines in the West Indies occurred from the mid-Miocene to the Pleistocene. Ancestral area results yielded a log likelihood of )lnL = 43.73 at the root node, with dispersal and extinction probabilities of 0.005745 and 0.00692, respectively. The most likely ancestral areas at the deepest nodes include (or are equivocal regarding) most areas in the West Indies except Jamaica, which was apparently colonized by Hypsirhynchus only after that island emerged in the late Miocene (Fig. 1). For nodes with more than one reconstructed area, it is difficult to determine without external evidence from our phylogeny (e.g. fossils, geology) if a widespread ancestor occupied more than one major island, or whether the phylogeny simply lacks signal for resolving the range. It appears that Hispaniola, Cuba and Puerto Rico were all colonized more than once, and it seems very likely that the Lesser Antilles and Jamaica were each colonized only once.
Species diversification through time
The LTT plot indicates a slight early accumulation of species relative to the pure-birth expectation (LDI = 0.16), although this does not appear to be significant based on the 95% CI under the null Yule model (Fig. 2). The c-value from our tree was )1.54 (Fig. 2). From the 5000 simulations including the eight missing taxa produced under a pure-birth model using the mccrTest (Rabosky, 2006), the critical value that indicates a bias towards early diversification is )1.70, and our empirical value is thus not significantly negative (P = 0.065). Furthermore, our tests using the random placement of the missing taxa within their appropriate genera yielded a range of c from )2.0 to )0.5, which encompasses the significance threshold of )1.70, but cannot reject much lower values. The difference in AIC between the best rate-constant (Yule) and rate-variable (DDL) models of diversification for our tree was 1.43. This is not significantly different from the distribution of AIC differences between rate-constant and rate-variable models simulated under a Yule model (P = 0.11). Finally, the lowest AIC among models that consider variable speciation and extinction was SPVAR (AIC = 0.28), indicating decreasing speciation with constant extinction. These lines of evidence suggest that diversification in alsophiines approximately followed a purebirth (Yule) process (see Appendix S3).

No significant deviation from a Yule process is evident, although lineages accumulated slightly faster than expected under a purely linear accumulation through time (LDI = 0.162).

Morphology shows significantly negative (morphological disparity index,

                       Brownian motion, indicating that no significant deviations from a random walk are evident in the clade. The first principal component (PC1) of niche accounted for 51% of the variance, and the highest loadings were from the following variables: BIO5 (maximum temperature of the warmest period; )0.85), BIO12 (annual precipitation; 0.93). For ecological niche (PC1), the best-fit model is white noise, followed closely by both Ornstein–Uhlenbeck and early burst models, which is a difficult pattern to interpret directly. Some authors have suggested that white noise provides a null model of no evolutionary signal (Kozak & Wiens, 2010), as white noise is equivalent to Ornstein–Uhlenbeck with infinitely high selection (L. J. Harmon, University of Idaho, pers. comm.). However, this interpretation is not unambiguous, and adherence to the white noise model may indicate that alsophiine niches are dictated by their physiological tolerances, or possibly by the available niches in their habitat, but without significant phylogenetic influence.
Plots of DTT for SVL and PC1 of niche were lower (MDI = )0.10) and higher (EDI = 0.59) than the null model, respectively (Fig. 3). This indicates that individuals within a clade are much more similarly sized than random, while differences between clades fall along a size gradient. For most of the history of the group, however, the median disparity falls within the 95% CI of the null model. In contrast, niche disparity is significantly higher than the null model, which indicates that each subclade includes a significant portion of the full range of niches.

Testing for differences in ecomorphological assemblages among island groups using phylogenetics ANOVA, neither body size (P = 0.14) nor ecological niche (P = 0.24) was significantly different across regions, suggesting that each island group comprises similar ecomorphological assemblages. The biogeographical rates test indicates that the single-rate Brownian motion model fits better than the region-variable model for size (DAICc = 2.46), indicating that there is no significant signal of rate variation among the major island groups for body size evolution. For niche, there was weak support (DAICc = 2.00) for a region-variable model, where Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles have significantly increased (r2 = 18.6 and 19.3, respectively) rates of climatic niche evolution compared with Cuba, Hispaniola and Jamaica (1.6, 2.4 and 1.1, respectively). For the trait-dependent diversification analyses using QuaSSE, constant null models provided a

significantly better fit than any of the rate-variable models, indicating that neither size nor niche is significantly related to rates of diversification.
DISCUSSION
A key expectation from studies of organisms that are thought to have encountered novel or unused ecological space is the rapid, early diversification of lineages (Schluter, 2000; Glor, 2010). This effect has been demonstrated for organisms that colonize new continents, islands or other unoccupied land masses or lakes (Losos & Ricklefs, 2009; Burbrink & Pyron, 2010). A well-studied example of this is the West Indian anoles, for which rapid diversification across the Greater and Lesser Antilles has resulted in a pattern of early bursts of diversification (Harmon et al., 2003; Rabosky & Glor, 2010). In contrast, we demonstrate that alsophiine snakes, a monophyletic group of 43 species that has occupied most of the Caribbean islands since the mid-Miocene, fail to show the signal of an early explosive radiation. Moreover, the best estimates from all tests indicate that these snakes diversified according to a pure-birth model with little to no rate variability in speciation, or in amounts of ecomorphological disparification (Fig. 2). Given the apparent availability of ecological opportunity, this suggests that early bursts of diversification are not guaranteed, even when substantial open niche space is available. Thus, even within groups such as squamates, replicated adaptive radiations in suitable areas is not a foregone conclusion, at least not at the broadest scale.
There are several explanations that might account for this pattern. In contrast to the anoles in the West Indies, it is possible that the colonization of the Caribbean did not represent a significant source of ecological opportunity for alsophiines. This does not seem likely, given the combined size of the land masses, the lack of competitors within Colubridae (which are naturally absent from the Greater Antilles), and the standing diversity of alsophiines, which is as large as that of other snake groups that show the pattern of early explosive radiation (Burbrink & Pyron, 2010). Another possibility is that diversification across these islands in these snakes is constrained by the waiting times between colonization events. Thus, even though ecological opportunity was available in the form of a massive land mass (as enumerated by combining distinct areas) with few competitors, access to all combined areas across the entire Caribbean was not available simultaneously, a potential requirement to produce an early burst of diversification. In contrast, islands and island groups were necessarily colonized one-by-one, yielding only a small portion of the ecological opportunity available throughout the entire West Indies.
Diversification patterns in alsophiines contrast with those of lampropeltinine snakes of similar group size that colonized North America from Asia, and reveal a strong signal of early explosive radiation (Burbrink & Lawson, 2007; Pyron & Burbrink, 2009c; Burbrink & Pyron, 2010). Once present in the New World, the ecological opportunity was probably not as

constrained by dispersal for lampropeltinines as it was for alsophiines. A continental system presents a large, mostly contiguous area for diversification. In contrast, island radiations require both rapid colonization and the ability of organisms to rapidly exploit the range of open niche space on each island (such as found in the case of the anoles). Thus, the modes of geographical speciation and diversification may be more heterogeneous on islands than in continental areas (see Pyron & Burbrink, 2010). Finally, it is clear that a decrease in speciation is necessary in order to detect early bursts of speciation (Rabosky & Lovette, 2008a,b). Perhaps alsophiines, with diversification beginning at a mere c. 12 Ma, have yet to show the recent slowdown in speciation, or have yet to fully diversify, although this seems unlikely given the diversity and size equivalence of the assemblages on each major island group.
Low within-subclade morphological disparity is expected for groups that show the pattern of early, high rates of speciation (Harmon etal., 2003; Burbrink & Pyron, 2010). Here, disparity partitioning through time was lower than the null model, suggesting that within-clade differences are minimal compared with differences among clades. While the MDI (morphological disparity index) value was negative for morphology, we note that our model includes error estimates around DTT, which suggests that morphological disparity may not be significantly different from the Brownian null model. Similarly, results from QuaSSE indicate that changes in morphology were not associated with variation in speciation rate. Although it has been suggested that when organisms move into new adaptive zones, both speciation rates and morphological change should be rapid (Simpson, 1944; Schluter, 2000), the coupling of these events is often not found (Harmon et al., 2010).
In contrast to morphological disparity, however, ecological niche disparity was significantly higher than the null model, and the EDI (ecological disparity index) value was positive (Fig. 3). This suggests that each subclade has the full range of ecological niche present in all alsophiines. High withinsubclade disparity is expected for organisms that do not show early bursts of speciation (Harmon et al., 2003). The pattern of high ecological and low morphological disparity is unexpected if changes in ecology govern changes in morphology. Our results show, at least for alsophiines, that the processes of ecological and morphological diversification are not directly linked. Similar to changes in morphology, changes in ecology do not influence changes in speciation rates, and do not show strong phylogenetic signal. Neither is there any significant variation in rates of size evolution among any of the major island groups, which would be indicative of variable responses to new sources of ecological opportunity through time. While there is some evidence of increased rates of climatic niche evolution in the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico, this is not correlated with increased area or diversity (e.g. in regions such as Cuba and Hispaniola), as would be expected during an ecological adaptive radiation (e.g. Schluter, 2000).

Although ecological opportunity might be expected to yield predictable patterns across many organisms in the same region, we show that deterministic patterns within areas may not be the general rule. Whether this particular case is due to a lack of deterministic processes driving adaptive radiations in areas or to various historical contingencies is unclear. While the anoles of the West Indies represent the gold standard for examining adaptive radiation and show the defining signal of early bursts of speciation, this pattern is not replicated among another diverse group of squamates, alsophiine snakes, even though ecological opportunity was likely to have been present and has been shown to trigger rapid diversification in similar assemblages (Burbrink & Pyron, 2010). Thus, the question is: will additional comparative studies of diverse groups in similar regions yield similar signals of diversification, or do historical contingencies and the peculiarities of the biology of each organism (e.g. dispersal ability, range size, competition) preclude a unified pattern from occurring across groups? Further comparative study in a geographical and ecological context is needed to understand the general deterministic processes governing the interaction between adaptive radiations and ecological opportunity among areas.
