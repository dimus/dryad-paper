Abstract
This study represents the first molecular survey of the ichthyofauna of Taal Lake and the first DNA barcoding attempt in Philippine fishes. Taal Lake, the third largest lake in the Philippines, is considered a very important fisheries resource and is home to the world’s only freshwater sardine, Sardinella tawilis. However, overexploitation and introduction of exotic fishes have caused a massive decline in the diversity of native species as well as in overall productivity of the lake. In this study, 118 individuals of 23 native, endemic and introduced fishes of Taal Lake were barcoded using the partial DNA sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. These species belong to 21 genera, 17 families and 9 orders. Divergence of sequences within and between species was determined using Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) distance model, and a neighbour-joining tree was generated with 1000 bootstrap replications using the K2P model. All COI sequences for each of the 23 species were clearly discriminated among genera. The average within species, within genus, within family and within order percent genetic divergence was 0.60%, 11.07%, 17.67% and 24.08%, respectively. Our results provide evidence that COI DNA barcodes are effective for the rapid and accurate identification of fishes and for identifying certain species that need further taxonomic investigation.

Introduction
Barcodes are machine-readable representation of data which makes possible efficient and accurate management of information. DNA barcoding applies this system in the management of living things through the use of short, standardized gene regions (Hebert & Gregory 2005). The DNA barcoding identification system utilizes approximately 650 base pairs from the first half of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) as a single complex character to identify species (Dasmahapatra & Mallet 2006). To date, the COI gene has been gaining support in serving as the DNA marker for barcoding animals because of its variable yet standardized, extremely robust and short sequence (Valentini et al. 2008).
DNA barcoding opens opportunities for the advancement of taxonomy by integrating ecological, genetic, and morphological data to provide a robust analysis of the specimen under study (Dayrat 2005). There have been increasing reports demonstrating the usefulness of DNA barcoding, which include assigning individuals to their

corresponding taxa (Hebert & Gregory 2005; Ward et al. 2005, 2009; Ward 2009), flagging certain specimens for further taxonomic analysis (Lara et al. 2009) and assisting in species discovery (Hajibabaei et al. 2007; Miller 2007).
DNA barcoding has become relevant especially in developing countries like the Philippines because of rampant introduction of invasive and pest species, which in turn lead to higher extinction rates (Miller 2007). This is evident in the dwindling biodiversity of Taal Lake, the third largest lake in the Philippines, having a total area of about 26 000 ha. It has been reported that 87% of the previous listings of fish species had disappeared during the same time that aquaculture flourished in the lake (Papa et al. 2008). From the original 101 species during the 1920s (Herre 1927a; Villadolid 1937), only 29 species are left, of which five are endemic, in a survey conducted by the Philippine National Fisheries and Development Institute (NFRDI) in 2008–2009. The endemic species include Sardinella tawilis, the only known freshwater sardine in the world and is considered the living treasure of Taal Lake because of its importance as a fisheries resource.
DNA barcoding has not been carried out in Philippine finfishes. Thus, this study aims to accurately identify and catalogue the ichthyofauna of Taal Lake and improve the

quality of taxonomic information by providing records of novel barcode sequences as well as species descriptions for the freshwater fishes. The study provides a better understanding of the ichthyofauna and ecology of the lake and gives baseline information that can be used in creating better conservation strategies for the Taal Lake ecosystem. Furthermore, the information would be made readily available to nontaxonomists, researchers and policy makers to aid them in their efforts in effective management of the lake.
Materials and methods
One to ten specimens of each species (Table 1) were collected using gill nets and fish traps from Taal Lake (14°00¢N; 121°00¢E) specifically from the following localities along the lake: Tanauan, Talisay, San Nicolas, Butong, Ambulong and Laurel, Batangas. The fishes were identified based on identification keys in FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2010), Mercene (1990), Conlu (1986), Herre (1927b), FAO species identification guide for fishery purposes and other references. Digital images, GPS coordinates of collection sites and other metadata were also recorded. At least 20 mg of tissue was extracted from the right lateral side of the fish and was immersed in 95% ethanol until further use.
DNA was extracted using Promega WizardÒ Genomic DNA Purification Kit. The DNA samples were then
dissolved in 250 ll of nuclease-free water and stored at )20 °C until further use. COI gene amplification was carried out using combinations of the following forward and reverse primers (Ward et al. 2005): FishF1-5¢TCA ACCAACCACAAAGACATTGGCAC3¢, FishF2-5¢TCGA CTAATCATAAAGATATCGGCAC3¢, FishR1-5¢TAGAC TTCTGGGTGGCC AAAGAATCA3¢, FishR2-5¢ACTTCA GGGTGACCGAAGAATCAGAA3¢. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted in 25-ll volumes, which contained 0.5 ll of dNTP (0.05 mM), 1.25 ll of each primer (0.1 mM), 2.5 ll of 1· PCR buffer, 0.125 ll of Taq polymerase, 15.375 ll of ultrapure water and 5.0 ll of DNA template. These were run in the following conditions (Ward et al. 2005): preliminary denaturation at 95 °C for 0.5 min followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, primer annealing at 54 °C for 0.5 min and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min concluded the process. PCRs were then run in a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) and sent to Macrogen, Inc. in South Korea for bidirectional sequencing on an ABI 3730xl or 3700 DNA sequencer.
Sequence alignment of the forward and reverse strands and the generation and editing of the consensus sequence were made using Staden Package (Bonfield et al. 1995). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW, and extent of sequence difference between species was

calculated by averaging pairwise comparisons of sequence differences across all individuals using the software MEGA 4 (Tamura et al. 2007). Pairwise genetic distance among COI sequences was determined by the Kimura 2-Parameter method (K2P) (Kimura 1980), and neighbour-joining (NJ) trees (Saitou & Nei 1987) were constructed with bootstrap analysis of 1000 pseudoreplications (Lakra et al. 2011). Sequences of selected species available from GenBank were included in the analysis for certain comparisons and validations.
Individual samples were deposited at the Institute of Biology at the University of the Philippines, Diliman. Each studied fish was identified by a voucher labeled with species name, date and site of collection. Trace files, images and metadata for each individual were submitted to the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) and Dryad. COI sequences were also submitted to GenBank and were assigned accession numbers HQ654650 – HQ654762.
Results
General findings
A total of 118 COI sequences were generated from 23 species belonging to 21 genera, 17 families and nine orders (Table 1). Sample sizes in this study ranged from one (Clarias batrachus and Liza subviridis) for species that are difficult to sample to ten (Ophieleotris aporos) for species having high morphological plasticity, with an average specimen number per species of 4.9. One of the 23 species, Sardinella tawilis, is endemic to Taal Lake, 15 are native to the Philippines, and seven are introduced. Five of the introduced species, Clarias batrachus, Oreochromis niloticus, Carassius auratus, Parachromis managuensis and Channa striata, have been previously reported, while Sarotherodon melanotheron and Amphilophus citrinellus are new records in the lake. Prior to this study, no previous records were found in GenBank for 13 species, namely Megalops cyprinoides, Liza melinoptera, Atherinomorus endrachtensis, Ambassis miops, Apogon hyalosoma, Leiopotherapon plumbeus, Toxotes jaculatrix, Sarotherodon melanotheron, Ophieleotris aporos, Glossogobius aureus, Awaous melanocephalus, Parachromis managuensis and Oligolepis acutipennis, giving a total of 69 novel sequences.
The amplified sequences ranged from 554 base pairs to 656 base pairs, with an average of 630 base pairs. Furthermore, no insertions and deletions were found in the sequences and no stop codons were found in its translation, implying that all amplified sequences code for functional mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I.
Average genetic distance within species was 0.60% compared with 11.07% for species within genera, while genetic distances within family and order were 17.67%

 and 24.08%, respectively (Table 2). As seen from these values, increasing genetic variation was observed in increasing taxonomic levels, thus supporting a marked change in genetic divergence at the species boundaries. The average congeneric distance is approximately 18-fold the average conspecific distance, giving a high resolution between clusters in the NJ tree. Furthermore, DNA barcoding was able to group the species to their corresponding families (Fig. 1). The average nucleotide frequencies for all 23 species are as follows: A = 24.13%, T = 28.86%, G = 18.20% and C = 28.82%. The mean, minimum and maximum %GC content for each codon position of all the 23 species are given in Table 3.
New discoveries and conflicting taxonomic designations
The groups listed in the following represent cases when DNA barcoding reveals new information which either confirms species demarcation or warrants further taxonomic reexamination.
Halfbeaks. Only one native halfbeak of the genus Hyporhamphus, specifically Hyporhamphus quoyi, was reported in Taal Lake (Froese & Pauly 2010). To verify the identity of the halfbeaks we collected, available sequences of the same genus were obtained from GenBank (EF607400, EU595152, EU595151, FJ237602, FJ237601, EF609376) and a NJ tree was generated (Fig. 2). A mean pairwise distance of 14.90% was found between our specimens and Hyporhamphus quoyi (EU595153, FJ237994). On the other hand, our specimens clustered closely with Hyporhamphus affinis (EF609376) with mean pairwise distance of 1.10% and bootstrap support of 100. Further examination of the specimens was carried out using morphometric methods (Herre 1927b; Conlu 1986; Collete 1999; Froese & Pauly 2010), and our measurements fell closest to the range of Hyporhamphus affinis.
Mullets. Two species of Liza, Liza subviridis and Liza melinoptera, both native to the Philippines, were reported in FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2010), while the 2008–2009 NFRDI survey reported only one species, Liza macrolepis, in Taal Lake. A total of five specimens of mullet

   belonging to the genus Liza were barcoded. One of the five specimens diverged from the other four resulting in two clusters (Fig. 3). Genetic distance within the four specimens of a single cluster was 0.27%, while the mean genetic distance between the two clusters is 15.3%. This is well above the 3% intraspecific genetic distance threshold (Ward 2009) giving evidence that we collected two species of Liza.
Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences of the genus Liza were obtained from GenBank for additional comparisons (GenBank accession numbers EU392242, EU392241, EU392240, EU392239, EU392235, EU392234, EU715469, FJ384677, FJ347967, EF609547, FN600159). A single COI sequence of L.subviridis (EU392242) was found to cluster with the four specimens in the NJ tree with bootstrap support of 98 and mean K2P distance of 9.75%, while two of the three sequences of L. macrolepis (EF609547, FJ347967) clustered with the single specimen with bootstrap support of 100 and mean K2P distance of 2.2% (Fig. 3). Identification based on body shape, number of transverse scales and length of pre-orbital bone (Harrison & Senou 1999; Froese & Pauly 2010) showed that the four specimens that clustered with Liza subviridis (EU392242) were Liza melinoptera, while the other specimen that clustered with Liza macrolepis (FJ347967, EF609547) was Liza subviridis. Thus, there is a possibility that misidentifications may have occurred among the Liza macrolepis and Liza subviridis GenBank accessions.
Carangids. Ten specimens representing two Caranx species native to the Philippines, Caranx ignobilis and Caranx sexfasciatus, were obtained for COI amplification. K2P distance analysis was in complete concordance with current classification that is based on morphological characters. COI sequences were able to discriminate the two species of Caranx by having a genetic distance of 10.03% between the two species. COI sequences of five C. ignobilis (DQ884975, DQ884977, DQ884976, DQ885074, FJ347936) and two C. sexfasciatus (EF609305 and DQ427061) were taken from GenBank for added comparison and validation. A neighbour-joining tree was then created (Fig. 4). Specimens of the two species formed two well-defined clusters. In addition, C. sexfasciatus specimens taken from Taal Lake formed a single cluster distinct from the cluster of C. sexfasciatus taken from GenBank. This may indicate the presence of geographically subdivided populations.

Gobies. Three species of gobies, Glossogobius aureus, Awaous melanocephalus and Oligolepis acutipennis, all native to Philippine waters, were obtained in Taal Lake. Glossogobius aureus has not been reported before in Taal Lake, although Glossogobius giuris, which is commonly mistaken for G. aureus, has been reported before. Classification based on morphology, specifically the predorsal fin scales, and dichotomous keys in FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2010) established the identity of G. aureus. Also, homology search of our sequences with those found in GenBank and BOLD revealed 99–100% match with G. aureus and only 87.5% match with G. giuris. The highest intraspecific divergence among the three gobies was found in Oligolepis acutipennis conspecifics (0.9%), while mean genetic distance between genera was found to be 21.03%. All three species from the family Gobiidae were well
discriminated by barcodes, and members of this family formed a compact, well-defined cluster in the NJ tree (not shown) supported by bootstrap values of 100%. All barcode sequences of these three species are novel sequences.
Cichlids. Four species of tilapias, Oreochromis niloticus, Parachromis managuensis, Sarotherodon melanotheron and Amphilophus citrinellus, all recently introduced in the lake and used widely for aquaculture were barcoded. Mean K2P distance within species of family Cichlidae was 2.30% with O. niloticus, showing the greatest intraspecific genetic divergence with a mean K2P distance of 6.26%. Mean interspecific K2P distance among the four species was 15.92%. All four species formed four distinct clusters in a NJ tree (not shown) supported by bootstrap values of 97–99%.

Sequences from GenBank of three specimens each of O. niloticus (EU751881 – EU751883), O. urolepis (FJ348118 – FJ348120), O. mossambicus (EU751879, FJ348101 – FJ348102) and O. aureus (FJ348091 – FJ348093) were taken for generation of the NJ tree (Fig. 5). O. mossambicus and O. niloticus did not form distinct clusters. O. niloticus specimens 1 and 3 showed 0% K2P distance with one O. mossambicus (EU571879) but a mean genetic distance of 4.1% with other O. mossambicus specimens (FJ348101, FJ348102). In contrast, O. niloticus specimen 5 had a K2P distance of 1.7% with O. mossambicus (EU571879). O. niloticus specimens 2 and 4, on the other hand, had a mean K2P distance of 0.15% with O. aureus (FJ348091, FJ348092,
FJ348093). It must be noted that these species are used commercially for aquaculture and may have undergone hybridization.
Discussion
The present study represents the first molecular survey of the ichthyofauna of Taal Lake, Philippines. The study shows the effectiveness of the COI gene for identifying the freshwater fishes from Taal Lake by being able to discriminate all of the 23 species found in the lake.
Twenty-three species were sampled and utilized for the generation of DNA barcodes. The number is low

compared with the 29 listed species in the NFRDI 2008– 2009 survey, reflecting the dwindling number of fishes in the lake. Furthermore, only 11 species that were identified using morphology and DNA barcoding matched the 29 listed, while the other 12 species are either newly introduced in the lake or may have been incorrectly identified in the original list. In comparison with the list in FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2010), five species, namely Sarotherodon melanotheron, Amphilophus citrinellus, Glossogobius aureus, Hyporhamphus affinis and Awaous melanocephalus, have not been reported in the lake before. The first two species must have been recently introduced in the lake, while the other three could have been mistaken for other species owing to the difficulty in using morphological traits alone for the accurate identification of these species.
Species examined formed a single, consistent array of barcode sequences that are distinct from those of other species. Barcode analyses primarily seek to accurately identify and demarcate species boundaries to assign unknown individuals to known species. However, unsuspected diversity and overlooked species are often detected, sometimes astonishingly (Hubert et al. 2008; Lakra et al. 2011).
In this study, average K2P distances among conspecifics and congenerics were 0.60% and 11.07%, respectively. Hence, the congeneric distance was approximately 18· the conspecific distance. Mean divergence among species within families increased to 17.67% and within orders to 24.08%. These data show that increasing genetic variation was observed with increasing taxonomic levels and can be compared with the ranges obtained by Lara et al. (2009) with genetic distances of 0.6% for conspecifics, 9.1% for congenerics and 20.2% for confamilial species of 127 COI sequences representing 27 species of Cuban freshwater fishes. Data obtained in this study are also consistent with those obtained by Hubert et al. (2008) for 1360 COI sequences from 190 species of Canadian freshwater fishes with values of 0.3%, 8.3% and 15.38% among conspecifics, congenerics and confamilial species, respectively.
DNA barcoding proves to be effective in flagging specimens, meriting further taxonomic re-evaluation. Preliminary species identification of some juveniles as well as specimens that were damaged during the catching process made identification based on morphology difficult if not impossible. It was not until barcode sequences of these specimens were compared with sequences from GenBank and BOLD when the identities of these specimens were established.
Furthermore, DNA barcoding was able to discriminate cryptic species or species of highly similar morphology. More samples of the genus Caranx were obtained for the study because of highly similar morphologies that
made species identification difficult. However, barcoding was able to identify 100% of Caranx samples. Two distinct clusters of Caranx were formed, separating the two species of highly similar morphological attributes with an average interspecific distance of 10.64% and average intraspecific distances of 0.71% and 3.05% for C. ignobilis and C. sexfasciatus, respectively. The relatively high intraspecific sequence divergence for C. sexfasciatus between the sequences obtained from GenBank and sampled specimens may be attributed to geographically subdivided populations because the C. sexfasciatus sequences from GenBank were from Australian marine waters.
There were numerous claims that the declining biodiversity of the lake is because of the introduction of alien species of cichlids. These include Oreochromis niloticus (Mercene 1997; Mamaril 2001) as well as Parachromis managuensis (Rosana et al. 2006). These species introductions lead to severe disruptions in the ecology of the lake because of competition, direct predation or hybridization (Rosana et al. 2006). In fact, two more species of cichlids that have never been reported in the lake before were sampled in this study, giving evidence that rampant introduction of exotic species is still ongoing.
All four species of cichlids obtained in Taal Lake were well discriminated by the DNA barcodes with 2.30% mean intraspecific genetic distance and 15.92% mean interspecific genetic distance. However, O. niloticus showed a very high intraspecific genetic distance with a mean K2P distance of 6.26%, which is well above the 3% threshold (Ward 2009). For additional verification, sequences of three more species of Oreochromis were obtained from GenBank, and we found that the intraspecific and interspecific K2P distances of the four Oreochromis species were 4.3% and 5.6%, respectively. It is possible that hybridization has occurred among the four species as these species are used commercially in aquaculture. Hypotheses concerning hybridization may be confirmed by analysing other mitochondrial genes because the entire mitochondrial genome should be transmitted to the hybrid (Melo-Ferreira et al. 2005). Also, O. niloticus specimens 1 and 3 showed 0% K2P distance with one O. mossambicus (EU571879), which indicates that these specimens may belong to a single species or that misidentification may have occurred in the GenBank specimen.
In this study, DNA barcoding has successfully identified individuals down to the species level with a 100% success rate. Furthermore, the study was the first to report the presence of five new species in the lake, namely Hyporhamphus affinis, Sarotherodon melanotheron, Amphilophus citrinellus, Glossogobius aureus and Awaous melanocephalus. Metadata and images of the ichthyofauna of Taal Lake together with a total of 118 COI sequences, 69 of which are novel sequences, have been submitted
