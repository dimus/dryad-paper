Abstract
DNA barcoding is a technique to identify species by using standardized DNA sequences. In this study, a total of 105 samples, representing 30 Parnassia species, were collected to test the effectiveness of four proposed DNA barcodes (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA and ITS) for species identification. Our results demonstrated that all four candidate DNA markers have a maximum level of primer universality and sequencing success. As a single DNA marker, the ITS region provided the highest species resolution with 86.7%, followed by trnH-psbA with 73.3%. The combination of the core barcode regions, matK+rbcL, gave the lowest species identification success (63.3%) among any combination of multiple markers and was found unsuitable as DNA barcode for Parnassia. The combination of ITS+trnH-psbA achieved the highest species discrimination with 90.0% resolution (27 of 30 sampled species), equal to the four-marker combination and higher than any two or three marker combination including rbcL or matK. Therefore, matK and rbcL should not be used as DNA barcodes for the species identification of Parnassia. Based on the overall performance, the combination of ITS+trnH-psbA is proposed as the most suitable DNA barcode for identifying Parnassia species. DNA barcoding is a useful technique and provides a reliable and effective mean for the discrimination of Parnassia species, and in combination with morphology-based taxonomy, will be a robust approach for tackling taxonomically complex groups. In the light of our findings, we found among the three species not identified a possible cryptic speciation event in Parnassia.

Introduction
Parnassia L. (Parnassiaceae), a genus of perennial herbs, is predominantly distributed in arctic and temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere (Phillips 1982; Hultga ̊rd 1987; Gu & Hultga ̊rd 2001; Simmons 2004). Specimens of this genus are easily recognized by their basal leaf rosettes, generally long peduncles, single-flowed inflorescences, pentamerous flowers, commissural stigmas and the presence of a staminodium opposite each petal (Gu & Hultga ̊rd 2001). Parnassia includes about 50–70 species, depending on the taxonomy followed (Phillips 1982; Gu & Hultga ̊rd 2001; Wu et al. 2003; Simmons 2004). Parnassia palustris L. is the most widely distributed species of the genus, with populations in North America, Europe and Asia, reaching Morocco in the south (Korta 1972). However, most of the species

have a limited distribution range, and more than 30 species are confined to China and the Himalayan region (Hultga ̊rd 1987). The East Himalaya–Hengduan Mountain region is one important centre of diversification and high endemism of Parnassia (Handel-Mazzetti 1941; Phillips 1982; Ku 1987; Wu et al. 2003; Simmons 2004).
The taxonomic status of Parnassia and its infrageneric classification have been widely discussed (Drude 1875; Franchet 1897; Engler 1930; Handel-Mazzetti 1941; Phillips 1982; Ku 1987; Wu et al. 2003). However, taxonomic treatments of Parnassia species are very controversial because of their often restricted geographic distribution, and the treatment of species in regional floras (e.g., Hooker & Thomson 1858; Handel-Mazzetti 1941; Wien 1966; Nasir & Ali 1972; Phillips 1982; Grierson 1987; Ku 1995). The complexity of the taxonomy and the limited morphological variation of this genus make species identification difficult, especially for some closely related species, such as Parnassia wightiana, P. delavayi and P. mysorensis.

DNA barcording is a new biological tool to achieve accurate, rapid and automatable species identification without morphological knowledge, by using short DNA regions (Hebert et al. 2003; Savolainen et al. 2005). Combining DNA sequences with existing morphological characters can fasten the rate of identification and classification of species (Smith et al. 2005; Will et al. 2005; DeSalle 2006; Hajibabaei et al. 2007). A two-marker combination of rbcL+matK was recommended for barcoding land plants by the Consortium for the DNA Barcode of Life (CBOL) Plant Working Group (2009). The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid trnH-psbA region were suggested to be tested as complementary plant barcoding regions at the Third International Barcoding of Life Conference (Hollingsworth et al. 2011).
Here, we selected four candidate barcodes (i.e. matK, rbcL, trnH-psbA and ITS) for 30 Parnassia species. Our aims were (i) to examine the effectiveness of these four regions as barcodes for Parnassia; (ii) to evaluate the congruence of traditional taxonomic treatments for some closely related species based on morphological data, with DNA barcoding results.
Materials and methods
Plant materials
A total of 105 samples were collected in this study, representing 30 species of Parnassia. There were at least two individuals sampled for each species from different populations, and more individuals for widespread species to fully represent their distribution ranges (Table S1, Supporting information). All corresponding vouchers were deposited in the Herbarium of the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences (KUN). Materials of nine specimens of five species occurring in North America and Central Asia were sampled from the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (E). Species concepts followed Ku (1987) and Phillips (1982). Lepuropetalon spathulatum was selected as outgroup for tree-based analysis (Zhang & Simmons 2006).
Table 1 Primers and reaction condition used in this study
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
Total DNA was extracted from silica-gel dried-leaf material and herbarium specimens using the CTAB procedure (Doyle & Doyle 1987). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed in a 20-lL reaction mixture containing 1· Taq buffer [50 mM (NH4) 2SO4; 75 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3); 50 mM KCl; 0.001% gelatin]; 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM of dNTPs, 0.5 lM of each primer, 1.0 U of Taq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Dalian, China), and 1 lL of genomic DNA (25–30 ng). For matK, the addition of 4% DMSO and 0.2 lL 0.1 mg ⁄ mL BSA was used for PCR amplification. The primer information and thermocycling conditions for the four markers used in this study are listed in Table 1. Purified PCR products were sequenced in both directions with the PCR primers on an ABI 3730 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The newly acquired DNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank and their accession numbers provided in Table S1 (Supporting information).
Data analysis
Sequences for each region were aligned with CLUSTAL X (Thompson et al. 1997) and then manually adjusted in BIOEDT v.7 (Hall 1999). The genetic pairwise distance for each marker was calculated using MEGA4 and the Kimura two-parameter (K2P) distance model (Tamura et al. 2007). Additionally, interand intra-specific genetic divergences of the four candidate DNA regions were analysed by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (Meyer & Paulay 2005). To test whether accurate species assignments can be made among the samples on single marker and combinations of markers, we used the ‘best match’ and ‘best close match’ functions of the program TaxonDNA (Meier et al. 2006). Furthermore, to evaluate whether individual samples of a species clustered in species-specific monophyletic clades, neighbour-joining (NJ) trees were constructed based on single marker and all possible combinations of the four candidate markers in MEGA4, with pairwise deletion based on the K2P distance model. Bootstrap values (BP) were calculated over 10 000 replications.

Results
Variation of barcoding markers
All Parnassia samples were successfully amplified and sequenced using universal primer pairs for the four DNA barcoding regions (Table 1). A total number of 420 sequences were obtained from the 30 sampled Parnassia species. The variability of the four DNA markers for all examined samples is summarized in Table 2. ITS showed the highest interspecific sequence divergence (9.18%), followed by trnH-psbA (5.84%) and matK (1.88%). rbcL had the lowest interspecific (0.74%) and intraspecific divergence (0.08%). The highest intraspecific sequence distance was recorded for ITS (0.71%), followed by trnH-psbA (0.53%). ITS and trnH-psbA showed a much number of variable sites and length variation than rbcL and matK. rbcL was most highly conserved with fewest variable sites and lacking indels (Table 2).
Assessment for barcoding gaps
We analysed the interspecific and intraspecific genetic divergences of the four DNA regions with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. In these, ITS exhibited the highest divergence and rbcL showed the lowest at the interspecific level (Table 3). At the intraspecific level, the lowest divergence was recorded for rbcL, while there were no

significant differences of intraspecific sequence divergences between ITS and trnH-psbA (Table 4). This was also supported by similar mean intraspecific sequence distances for ITS and trnH-psbA, with 0.53% and 0.71%, respectively (Table 2).
We did not find any distinct barcoding gap in the distributions of divergences for any marker, especially in the core barcodes rbcL and matK (Fig. 1). These results demonstrated that there was a larger range distribution of interand intra-specific distances for ITS and trnHpsbA than for rbcL or matK (Tables 3 and 4), indicative of the higher sequence variation among individuals ⁄ species for ITS and trnH-psbA with higher species resolution.
Applicability for species discrimination
TaxonDNA and a tree-based method (NJ) were used to perform the species identification of Parnassia (Table 5, Fig. 2). Based on the ‘best match’ model, the species discriminatory power of the four DNA regions was 33.33% (rbcL), 63.80% (matK), 94.28% (trnH-psbA) and 95.23% (ITS), respectively (Table 5). Species discrimination for combinations of two-marker ranged from 71.42% to 98.09%, with the core barcode rbcL+matK providing the lowest species discrimination (71.42%). The remaining two-marker combinations showed relatively high levels of species identification (94.28–96.19%), with ITS+trnHpsbA being the combination with the highest success rate.

   Fig. 1 Relative distribution of interspecific and intraspecific distances for the four DNA barcoding markers of Parnassia. x-axes relate to K2P distances arranged in intervals, and the y-axes correspond to the percentage of occurrences.
All two-marker combinations provided higher resolution than single markers, except for rbcL that showed little contribution to increase the discrimination rate. For the three-marker combinations, the core barcode (rbcL+matK) plus ITS or trnH-psbA provided 98.09% and 96.16% species discrimination, respectively. Species discrimination of the four DNA markers combined was 98.09%, which was equal to the two-marker combination of ITS+trnHpsbA.
In the tree-based analysis, ITS provided the highest species discrimination (86.7%), followed by trnH-psbA (73.3%), matK (63.3%) and rbcL (43.3%). ITS combined with rbcL, matK, and rbcL+matK provided the same ability for species discrimination as ITS alone (Tabel 6). A combination of ITS+trnH-psbA provided the highest species identification (90%) among all combinations (Fig. 2). Individuals for 27 of the 30 sampled Parnassia species formed monophyletic clade in the NJ tree, and most of the monophyletic species had high BP of over 90%. The samples of two species, P. wightiana and P. yunnanensis,
did not fell in monophyletic clades. In addition, a monophyletic P. viridiflora fell among samples of P. trinervis (Fig. 2).
Discussion
Evaluation of the potential barcodes for Parnassia
An ideal DNA barcode should be routinely retrievable with a single primer pair, be amenable to bidirectional sequencing with little requirement for manual editing of sequence traces and provide maximal discrimination among species (CBOL Plant Working Group 2009). The single primer pairs for each of the four barcodes tested here performed without fail, as all samples of Parnassia were successfully amplified and sequenced (Table 2). This indicated a very high universality for all the four DNA regions used here.
Species discriminatory power is another important criterion for a DNA barcode (Hebert et al., 2004; Kress &

   Erickson, 2007; CBOL Plant Working Group 2009). An ideal DNA barcode should provide high ability of species discrimination and identification (Kress et al. 2005; Lahaye et al. 2008; Hollingsworth et al. 2009) and exhibit a ‘barcode gap’ between intraspecific divergence and interspecific divergence (Meyer & Paulay 2005). Here, we found no distinct barcoding gap for rbcL and matK in Parnassia. However, ITS and trnH-psbA exhibited a relatively well-defined gap between intraspecific and interspecific divergences (Fig. 1). At the single DNA barcode level, the ITS region showed the highest genetic distance between and within species (9.18% and 0.71%, respectively). It also provided the highest species resolution in this study, with a total of 26 of the 30 sampled species (86.7%) successfully identified. A high level of species discrimination of ITS was also reported in other groups (Ren et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011). ITS was initially proposed as DNA barcode for plants because of its high sequence divergence (Kress et al. 2005). However, it was considered too problematic and was rejected from incorporation into the core plant barcode because of the potential pitfalls of incomplete lineage sorting and inhomogeneous concerted evolution, divergent paralogous copies within individuals and pseudogenes (Alvarez & Wendel 2003; Chase et al. 2007; Starr et al. 2009; Hollingsworth et al. 2011). Though, in a recent study on a large data set, it was found that ITS was unproblematic in the majority of samples analysed and proposed to be incorporated into the core barcode for seed plants (China Plant BOL Group 2011).
In this study, these potential drawbacks of ITS were not found in Parnassia. Based on the high level of univer-
sality in PCR and sequencing aspects, and high species discrimination ability, ITS performed well as a single barcode for species identification in Parnassia. trnH-psbA is one of the more variable plastid spacer regions that have been widely used as plant barcodes, which distinguished the largest number of plant species for barcoding purposes (Kress et al. 2005; Kress & Erickson 2007; Fazekas et al. 2008). In this study, trnH-psbA distinguished 73.3% of the sampled species and thus showed a high potential as barcode for Parnassia. Of the two coding DNA regions, rbcL performed poorest in species discrimination with less than half the species (43.3%) successfully identified. Consequently, rbcL is not a good choice for barcoding Parnassia species. rbcL has high universality and sequence quality, but relatively low discriminating levels in angiosperms (CBOL Plant Working Group 2009). Though, it shows high discrimination power at family and genus level (Kress & Erickson 2007). With 19 of 30 (63.3%) sampled species of Parnassia distinguished by matK in our study, this region performed lower than ITS or trnH-psbA. As a single barcode, matK is thus not a good DNA marker among the four candidate DNA barcodes tested for Parnassia.
Combinations of barcoding markers often perform better than single candidate DNA barcodes, and several combinations of markers were proposed in the past (see Pennisi 2007; Hollingsworth 2008). A combination of matK+rbcL has been officially proposed as the core barcode for land plants (CBOL Plant Working Group 2009). However, this combination only provided 63.3% species identification (19 of 30 species), the lowest resolution

among all combinations in our study. This result indicated that the core barcode proposed by the CBOL Plant working Group is not the best choice for barcoding Parnassia species and needs to be supplemented with additional markers. Combinations of the two core barcodes plus ITS (rbcL+matK+ITS) and trnH-psbA (rbcL+matK+trnH-psbA), respectively, did not increase the species resolution significantly (Table 5). The fourmarker combination showed the highest species resolution (90.0%), equalling the two-marker combination of ITS+trnH-psbA (Table 5).
Considering the costs and the ultimate goal of high throughput species discrimination, the two-marker combination of ITS+trnH-psbA is the best choice as a barcode for species identification in Parnassia.
Taxonomy and species identification
Traditionally, biological specimens have been identified using morphological features, such as habit, leaf and flower shape, size and colour, etc. In morphologically and ergo taxonomically difficult groups, it sometime requires an experienced professional taxonomist years to deal with species identification (Li et al. 2011). Furthermore, if specimens are damaged or lack sufficient diagnostic characters, even the specialists may be unable to make identifications (Zhou et al. 2009). DNA barcoding as a new tool in the taxonomist’s toolbox (http://www.barcodeoflife.org/), however, can only solve the latter problems. In our opinion, in cases of taxonomic uncertainty because of morphological complexity, however, DNA barcoding cannot substitute taxonomy. It can only be used to test a taxonomic scenario. Parnassia is a good test case because its taxonomy is difficult because of lack of species differentiating characters (Drude 1875; Franchet 1897; Engler 1930; Handel-Mazzetti 1941; Phillips 1982; Ku 1987; Wu et al. 2003). In barcoding terms, if all samples for a given species are assigned to a monophyletic clade, a species can be regarded as successfully identified (Hebert et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2011). This was the case for all but three of the 30 species of Parnassia included, based on the combination of just two markers, ITS+trnH-psbA (Table 5), suggesting that DNA barcoding can be an effective tool for the discriminating species of Parnassia.
Multiple individuals (2–11) per species were collected in this study, and the NJ tree illustrates the 27 species of Parnassia that were well identified, with often high clade support (>90% for 25 species) (Fig. 2). These species confirmed by DNA barcoding are characterized by reliable morphological features and geographic distributions. For example, P. palustris is widely distributed in the temperature zone of the northern hemisphere (Simmons 2004). This species is characterized by cauline sessile leaves, one leaf near the middle, usually with 3 to numerous basal
leaves, ovate or long ovate; branched staminodes, divided into (7–) 9–21 filiform rays with globose glands at the apex. In this study, the five individuals of this species sampled, covering its entire distribution range (from North America, through Europe eastward to North Asia) clustered in a monophyletic clade in the NJ tree, even though they were collected from a very wide distribution range.
The three species included here, which did not form species-specific monophyletic clades, were P. wightiana, P. yunnanensis and P. trinervis (Fig. 2). The distribution of P. wightiana is centred in the Himalayan region, extending from southern India to western China and to central and southern China (Wu et al. 2003). This species showed a high level of intraspecific genetic variation. Among the 11 samples of P. wightiana, for instance, fell a clade of three samples of P. dilatata and a clade with the three samples of P. perciliata. There was a geographic aspect to the clustering, with four P. wightiana individuals from Guizhou-Guangxi-Hunan region forming a sister clade to P. dilatata from Guangxi, and two P. wightiana individuals collected from NE Yunnan-SW Sichuan clustered as sister to samples of P. perciliata collected from Chongqing (Fig. 2). The seeming polyphyly of P. wightiana might be explained by incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization or gene introgression between the species. Another, more likely explanation may be a case of polypatric speciation, with two geographically restricted species, P. dilatata in Guangxi and P. perciliata in Chongqing, having evolved independently from a widespread ancestor, P. wightiana. To fully understand this situation, however, further more detailed morphological and molecular studies on this species group are needed.
A similar situation was found for P. trinervis and P. viridiflora. Here, samples of P. viridiflora nested within the P. trinervis clade (Fig. 2). These two species are very similar in morphological features; P. trinervis and P. viridiflora are differentiated only by white vs. green petals, basal leaf blade usually cuneate at the base vs. usually subcordate at the base (Gu & Hultga ̊rd 2001). These are somewhat variable characteristics, and the two species could be recognized at intraspecific level. Parnassia viridiflora possibly derived from a P. trinervis population. Because of the small morphological differences between the two species, and before any taxonomic changes can be proposed, further population samples included for study to test the robustness of the molecular data are needed; the branches supporting the P. trinervis grades leading to P. viridiflora are not highly supported (60% and 77%, Fig. 2). If our data here are confirmed, it would be more reasonable to merge P. viridiflora into P. trinervis or to reduce it to a variety of P. trinervis.
A different situation was found for samples of P. yunnanensis; accessions of this species were divided
