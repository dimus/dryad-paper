Abstract
Plant feeding insects and the plants they feed upon represent an ecological association that is thought to be a key factor for the diversification of many plant feeding insects, through differential adaptation to different plant selective pressures. While a number of studies have investigated diversification of plant feeding insects above the species level, relatively less attention has been given to patterns of diversification within species, particularly those that also require plants for oviposition and subsequent larval development. In the case of plant feeding insects that also require plant tissues for the completion of their reproductive cycle through larval development, the divergent selective pressure not only acts on adults, but on the full life history of the insect. Here we focus attention on Rhinusa antirrhini (Curculionidae), a species of weevil broadly distributed across Europe that both feeds on, and oviposits and develops within, species of the plant genus Linaria (Plantaginaceae). Using a combination of mtDNA (COII) and nuclear DNA (EF1-a) sequencing and copulation experiments we assess evidence for host associated genetic differentiation within R. antirrhini. We find substantial genetic variation within this species that is best explained by ecological specialisation on different host plant taxa. This genetic differentiation is most pronounced in the mtDNA marker, with patterns of genetic variation at the nuclear marker suggesting incomplete lineage sorting and⁄or gene flow between different host plant forms of R. antirrhini, whose origin is estimated to date to the mid-Pliocene (3.77 Mya; 2.91–4.80 Mya).

Introduction
With approximately 4600 genera and 51 000 described plant feeding species (Oberprieler et al. 2007), the family Curculionidae, commonly referred to as weevils, constitutes the largest family in the animal kingdom based on the number of recognised species (Thompson 1992; Marvaldi et al. 2002). This successful adaptive radiation

has been linked to the origin of angiosperms, the evolution of a rostrum and shifts in larval feeding habits (Marvaldi et al. 2002; Oberprieler et al. 2007). An additional likely driver of this radiation is the specialisation of many weevil species onto one or a few host plant species. Specific host association, although not characteristic of all weevil species, is a distinctive and recurrent feature across many genera within the Curculionidae. However, host specificity within weevils has received relatively little attention at the molecular level, particularly within species (but see Erney et al.
Ó 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

1996; Barat et al. 2008; Downie et al. 2008; for examples). This is perhaps surprising given the economic importance of weevils both as agricultural pests and biocontrol agents.
Here we assess evidence for host specialisation and reproductive isolation within a weevil species across multiple host plant taxa over a wide geographic range. Our focal species is Rhinusa antirrhini, a univoltine fruit feeding weevil described from Sweden and subsequently reported from across Europe and western Russia (Caldara 2004). The genus Rhinusa is comprised of approximately 45 species distributed across the Palaearctic region (Caldara 2001) with life histories that involve endogenous parasitism, with larvae developing and feeding exclusively inside either fruit capsules, stems or roots, and inducing galls in some cases (Groppe 1992; Gassmann & Paetel 1998; Caldara 2001).
In North America, R. antirrhini is thought to have been accidentally introduced from its native Eurasia in the early 1900s (De Clerck-Floate & Harris 2002), using Linaria vulgaris as primary host. A South Macedonian population of R. antirrhini collected from Linaria dalmatica ssp. macedonica was deliberately introduced in Canada in 1993 for biological control of L. dalmatica (De Clerck-Floate & Harris 2002). Both the adventive strain and the introduced strain of R. antirrhini have shown only limited population increase and success in the reduction of Linaria populations in North America (De Clerck-Floate & Harris 2002; McClay & De Clerck-Floate 2002). This may in part be due to behavioural variation within the species, as experimental observations for R. antirrhini collected from L. vulgaris and L. dalmatica indicate that individuals of R. antirrhini exhibit strong preference for oviposition on the host plant species from which they are collected (I. Tosˇevski, unpublished). However, the heritability of this behaviour is unknown. It has long been suggested that experience in the natal habitat can play an important role in shaping habitat preferences of dispersing animals, and particularly of phytophagous insects (Davis & Stamps 2004 and references therein). Several theories, namely the Hopkins principle (Dethier 1954), the neo-Hopkins principle (Jaenike 1983) and the chemical legacy hypothesis (Corbet 1985) have been proposed as non-genetic explanations for this phenomenon. However, it is likely that multiple factors underlie the process (Barron 2001). In a study of host preferences in a granary weevil, Rietdorf and Steidle (2002), conclude that larval and early adult experience as well as genetic predisposition, can determine host preference. Thus, conditioning, genetics and selection could all be involved in the formation of a preference for a new host and eventually in the formation of a host race (Barron 2001). Indeed, the close association between endophagous insects and their host
plants may amplify the selection pressure imposed by the host (Mopper 1996), thus making endophagous insects particularly susceptible to ecological divergence following a host shift (Mopper & Strauss 1997; Berlocher & Feder 2002; Funk et al. 2002).
The occurrence of genetically distinct host forms in other phytophagous insect groups has been documented in detail (e.g. Feder et al. 1988; Waring et al. 1990; Via 1999; Via et al. 2000; Sword et al. 2005), suggesting that ecological specialization has played an important role in their diversification and speciation. A recent assessment of host associated differentiation within a community of insects utilising goldenrods (Stireman et al. 2005) shows that this could be a recurrent phenomenon, contributing significantly as a mode of speciation in phytophagous insects. However, despite the great diversity of insects and their hosts, evolutionary studies of intra-specific patterns of host use are few in number. Our aims are to: (1) assess levels of genetic variation within R. antirrhini; (2) evaluate to what extent the distribution of this variation corresponds to host plant; (3) assess evidence for reproductive barriers between weevils sampled from two different host plant species and (4) infer the timing of origin of any observed host entities within R. antirrhini. The host genus Linaria (Plantaginaceae, formerly Scrophulariaceae) has its centre of origin in the Mediterranean region and comprises approximately 150 species with a holarctic distribution (Hong 1983; Sutton 1988).We have sampled R. antirrhini from the four known host species of Linaria (within sections Linaria and Speciosae), including several recognised subspecies within two of these. Linaria genistifolia, the type species for section Speciosae, is naturally distributed in central and eastern Europe, extending across through the Asian regions of Turkey, Kazakstan and central Asia to west China (Sutton 1988). We have sampled from five subspecies: Linaria genistifolia genistifolia, L. genistifolia sofiana, L. genistifolia linifolia, L. genistifolia confertiflora and L. genistifolia artvinensis. Linaria dalmatica is naturally distributed in southern Europe (mainly the Balkan peninsula) and south west Asia (Sutton 1988) and we have sampled from the subspecies L. dalmatica macedonica. We have also sampled from L. rubioides, an endemic toadflax from the Balkan region and L. vulgaris, the type species of section Linaria (toadflax), native to western and eastern Europe, but widely naturalized in temperate regions (Sutton 1988). Within this last species we have sampled from multiple locations, from the UK through to Russia to provide some estimate of the role of geography in structuring genetic variation. Additionally we have sampled R. florum, an ecologically and phylogenetically related species that uses L. genistifolia genistifolia as a host in south-eastern Europe (Caldara

2008). To achieve aims 1–3 we use DNA sequence variation for the mitochondrial COII gene and the nuclear EF1-a gene. The mitochondrial COII gene is a powerful marker for the discrimination of evolutionary divergence of host-plant choice for oviposition because of its female inheritance combined with its high mutation rate and small effective population size (0.25) relative to the nuclear genome. The contrasting biparental inheritance, lower mutation rate and larger effective population size for the EF1-a gene are expected to result in less discriminatory power for intraspecific differentiation, but will complement an analysis of mtDNA variation by providing an assessment of the structuring of genetic variation from the nuclear genome. To attain our fourth aim we have undertaken cross copulation experiments between weevils sampled from Linaria vulgaris and Linaria genistifolia genistifolia and we evaluate the implications of these results in the light of our molecular data.
Materials and methods
Insect sampling for molecular analysis
We sampled 93 individuals of Rhinusa antirrhini collected over a broad range within the species distribution from eight different host-plant taxa of Linaria (Fig. 1; Table 1) plus two individuals of the related species R. florum collected on L. genistifolia genistifolia. Specimens were labelled, placed individually in 96% ethanol and stored at 4 °C until DNA extraction. Rhinusa griseohirta was sampled from Antirrhinum graniticum and used as an outgroup.
DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing reactions
Individual weevils were punctured through the abdomen and total genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy extraction Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After DNA extraction,
weevils were placed again in 96% ethanol and maintained at 4 °C as vouchers. A fragment of between 758 and 782 bp of the COII gene was amplified using the primers TL2-J-3038 (5¢-TAATATGGCAGATTAGTGCATTGGA) (Emerson et al. 2000) and TK-N 3782 (5¢-GAGACCATTACTTGCTTTCAGTCATCT) (EVA-Harrison Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA). Primers EF1-Bf (5¢-AGAACGTGAACGTGGTATCA) and EF1-Br (5¢-CTTGGAGTCACCAGCTACATAACC) were used to amplify a fragment of between 877 and 897 bp of the EF1-a gene.
Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) contained NH4 buffer (1x), 2.5–3.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.1– 0.5 lM of each primer and 0.5 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) in a 25 lL final volume. PCR cycles were carried out using the following thermal profile for COII: 95 °C for 3 min, 33 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing temperatures between 48 and 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. For EF1a a touchdown profile was used (Don et al. 1991): 94 °C for 1min 30s, 14 cycles at 94°C for 30s, 62°C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, decreasing the annealing temperature by two degrees every two cycles down to 50°C, then 24 cycles at 94°C for 30s, 48°C for 1min, 72°C for 1min, and 72°C for 7min as a final extension. PCR products were cleaned using the QIAquick PCR clean-up kit (QIAGEN), and a PerkinElmer BigDye terminator reaction protocol was followed to generate sequences in a PerkinElmer ABI3700 automated sequencer using the same primers for amplification reactions. Sequences for COII were obtained with the forward primer only whereas the EF1-a fragment was sequenced in both directions.
Sequence alignment and haplotype reconstruction
COII sequences were aligned by eye using BioEdit version 7.0.9 (Hall 1999). EF1-a forward and reverse sequences were assembled as contigs using BioEdit

  version 7.0.9 (Hall 1999) and Lasergene Seqman version 6 (DNASTAR, Inc.), and automatically aligned using the CLUSTAL method with further manual alignment. EF1-a haplotypes from heterozygous individuals were reconstructed with PHASE version 2.1.1 (Stephens et al. 2001) in order to identify their gametic phases. Using a Bayesian framework, this computational method has proven its accuracy in a variety of tests using both simulated and empirical data (Xu et al. 2002; Stephens & Donnelly 2003; Harrigan et al. 2008), thus avoiding costly and time-consuming PCR-product cloning procedures. Different methods to detect recombination in EF1-a were applied: RDP method (Martin & Rybicki
2000), Bootscanning (Salminen et al. 1995), GENECONV (Padidam et al. 1999), Maximum Chi-Square (Smith 1992; Posada & Crandall 2001a), Chimaera (Posada & Crandall 2001a) and Sister Scanning (Gibbs et al. 2000), which have been implemented in RDP3 (Martin et al. 2005).
Evolutionary tree construction
Neighbour-joining trees were generated in PAUP* version 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002) using the model of nucleotide substitution that best fits the data, determined with MODELTEST version 3.7(Posada & Crandall 1998). One

thousand bootstrap replicates using the NJ search were performed to assess branch support in the resulting tree topology. Maximum-parsimony tree construction was also performed with PAUP*. One hundred replicates of a heuristic search were performed with an initial random stepwise addition of sequences and tree bisection– reconnection branch swapping. Branch support was estimated from 1000 replicates of a bootstrap search. Bayesian analyses were also carried out with the program MRBAYES version 3.1 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). The settings were two simultaneous runs (each with two Markov chains) of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for three million generations, sampling every 100 generations, a heating parameter value of 0.20 and a ‘burn-in’ of 25%, using the general time reversible model (GTR + C + I) of sequence evolution with priors set to the default values. Summaries of 65% (19 500 samples) of the sampled parameter values and sampled trees were obtained, as well as a majority-rule consensus tree with posterior probabilities for each bipartition.
Haplotype network construction
Although evolutionary gene trees may be informative at the intraspecific level, relationships resulting from intrinsic processes of population dynamics (e.g. persistence of ancestral haplotypes, multifurcations, recombination and horizontal transfer) are better visualized in reticulated graphs or networks (Posada & Crandall 2001b; Cassens et al. 2005; Huson & Bryant 2006). For a given taxon these processes are expected to be more acute for nuclear genes that evolve more slowly with a larger effective population size than mtDNA genes. Gene genealogies were inferred using two approaches for haplotype network construction. Median-joining networks (Bandelt et al. 1999) were calculated with the program NETWORK version 4.5.1.0 (http://www.fluxusengineering.com) keeping the parameter e = 0. This method starts with minimum spanning trees combined within a single network and then, to reduce tree length, median vectors (consensus sequences) are added. Such vectors can be interpreted as possibly extant unsampled sequences or extinct ancestral sequences (Bandelt et al. 1999). In addition, TCS version 1.21 (Clement et al. 2000) was employed to infer haplotype networks using statistical parsimony (Templeton et al. 1992) with a confidence limit of 95%.
Genetic structure
To assess the roles of host plant and geography in the structuring of genetic variation within R. antirrhini two separate analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA; Excoffier et al. 1992) were performed for both the nuclear and
mitochondrial data using ARLEQUIN version 3.1 (Schneider et al. 2000). In the first analysis, the haplotypes were grouped by host plant, while for the second analysis haplotypes were grouped into three geographic regions: Western Europe, the Balkan region and Eastern Europe. A pairwise distance matrix was generated and used in the AMOVA with 1023 permutations as a significance test (a = 0.05). Also, estimates of F statistics (F-statistic analogs) were calculated overall for all host-associated populations and pairwise between host-associated populations to assess the degree of genetic differentiation among them, testing statistical significance with 1023 permutations (a = 0.05).
Estimation of divergence times
In the absence of geological and ⁄ or fossil calibration points to estimate divergence times we have taken a Bayesian approach using a generalized clock to estimate the age of the most recent common ancestor (mrca), and divergence times within R. antirrhini. Mitochondrial rates have been proposed for arthropods in the range of 1.2–4.96% pairwise divergence per million years (my) (Desalle et al. 1987; Brower 1994; Caccone & Sbordoni 2001; Wares 2001). A comparative rate estimate of the mtDNA COII gene across the Pancrustacea, including 15 hexapod orders, has demonstrated the Coleoptera rate to approximate the mean rate across the Pancrustacea (Cicconardi et al. 2010). We therefore apply a mean rate estimate of 3.05% pairwise divergence per million years for our analyses using BEAST version 1.4.8 (Drummond & Rambaut 2007). Unlike nonparametric rate smoothing (Sanderson 1997), penalised likelihood (Sanderson 2002) or the relaxed Bayesian approach as implemented in Multidivtime (Thorne & Kishino 2002) BEAST does not assume rate autocorrelation which may systematically distort branch lengths, reducing the ratio of deep to shallow nodes (Hugall & Lee 2004; Martin et al. 2004). Instead, BEAST accommodates among-branch rate variation by allowing each branch to draw its rate from a discretized lognormal distribution, whose shape is estimated as part of the analysis (Drummond et al. 2006). For our analyses we used an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular-clock model in BEAST with the average number of substitutions per site across the tree averaged to be 1.525 per million years, but with rates for individual branches unconstrained. Initial substitution model parameter values were selected according to the results of MODELTEST version 3.7 (Posada & Crandall 1998), with unconstrained prior distributions. A separate demographic model of constant population size was applied, in the form of a coalescent prior, to clades conforming to genetic variation within host associated lineages, and a Yule tree prior was used for the basal

branches connecting these. Input files were generated with BEAUTI version 1.4.8 (Rambaut & Drummond 2007). Two runs consisting of 100 000 000 generations each and sampling every 500 generations were performed and combined, checking sampling, mixing and convergence to a stationary distribution.
Cross copulation experiments
No choice copulation trials were conducted to assess the potential for reproductive isolation between beetles sampled from two different host plants, Linaria vulgaris and L. genistifolia genistifolia. A total of 271 weevils (138 females + 133 males) collected from seeds capsules of L. vulgaris and 191 weevils (86 females + 105 males) from L. g. genistifolia were sampled at the beginning of September in 2007. Males and females were separated and set up in four net-cages (30 · 25 · 45 cm) planted with their original host plants for hibernation. Weevils emerged from hibernation in the following May and two sets of copulation trials were established (Table 2). Pairs of weevils were placed in small plastic vials (40 mm diameter · 10 mm high) and fed twice a day with toadflax flowers (corresponding to the female’s original host) for 5–7 days to record matings, after which the male was removed. Females were then transferred into plastic cylinders (40 mm diameter · 9 cm high) containing flowering branches inside isolated field mesh-cages (200 · 200 · 240 cm) and monitored daily for oviposition on their original host plants. Flowering branches exposed to oviposition were collected after 30 days. All seed capsules were inspected and dissected recording offspring numbers (larvae, pupae and adults). Five replicate pairs of same plant control matings were also conducted.
Results
Mitochondrial COII analyses
The final alignment of the COII sequences consisted of 696 bp, with a total of 202 (29%) polymorphic nucleo-
tides of which 195 are parsimony informative. Thirtyseven different haplotypes were identified within R. antirrhini and these are available from GenBank under accession numbers HM007201–HM007237. Under the Akaike information criterion MODELTEST analyses revealed the transversion substitution model with invariant sites and rate heterogeneity across sites to best describe the pattern of sequence variation within this fragment, and this model was employed for the estimation of pairwise genetic distances and a neighbour-joining tree. The maximum ingroup genetic distance was 19% (15% uncorrected) and all three phylogenetic analyses revealed significant genetic structure associated with host plant use (Fig. 2). Seven mitochondrial lineages are clearly defined with bootstrap support values higher than 90%, and all but one of these is associated with a single host plant taxon. Lineage four is comprised of weevils collected from three different host plant taxa; Linaria genistifolia genistifolia, L. genistifolia sofiana, and L. dalmatica macedonica. An analysis of molecular variance revealed that 97% of the observed genetic variation in the mtDNA sequence data is explained by host plant use with 1.6% due to variation among populations within host plant groups and 1.4% accounts for variation within populations (Table S1, Supporting Information). Estimated pairwise Fst values show significant genetic differentiation between weevils sampled from different host plant taxa (Table S2, Supporting information), with 26 of 28 pairwise comparisons yielding high and significant levels of differentiation. When haplotypes are grouped by major geographic region, these explain 52% of the genetic variation (Table S3, Supporting information).
EF1-a analyses
DNA sequencing yielded a total of 39 EF1-a haplotypes from the 83 ingroup weevils, with length variation due to insertions and deletions ranging from 776 to 796 nucleotides. Thirty-six individuals were heterozygous and haplotypes were inferred manually from forward and

reverse sequence chromatograms following similar approaches as those reported by Flot et al. (2006) and Peters et al. (2007), and with PHASE, employing a 95% significance threshold. Thus 12 individuals were excluded from further analyses due to the inability to assign their haplotype state by either method. All 40 sequences are available from GenBank under accession numbers HM007238–HM007277.
From the 798 bp alignment (including alignment gaps) of EF1-a haplotypes, there were a total of 48 polymorphic nucleotides (6%) of which 47 are parsimony informative. MODELTEST analyses revealed the general time reversible substitution model with invariant sites and rate heterogeneity across sites to best describe the pattern of sequence variation within EF1-a, and this model was employed for the parameterisation of further analyses. The maximum ingroup genetic distance was 2.42% (uncorrected) and all three phylogenetic analyses described a less evident pattern of host-associated genetic structure (data not shown). To further explore patterns of relatedness among the nuclear sequences, median joining and statistical parsimony networks were constructed. Apart from some minor differences, both approaches describe the same relationships among the 40 different haplotypes. The median joining network contained a single ambiguous connection (Fig. 3). No reticulations were found in the parsimony network
(Fig. S1, Supporting information), but haplotypes corresponding to the outgroup Rhinusa griseohirta and R. florum, were not connected to the main network at the 95% parsimony connection limit. When the connection limit was reduced to 89% the haplotypes for Rhinusa griseohirta and R. florum were connected as in the median-joining network.
AMOVA analyses detected significant genetic variation associated with host plant taxon. Approximately 55% of the variation at the EF1-a locus is explained by hostplant use, with variation among populations within a host plant taxon accounting for less than 7%, while 39% of the observed genetic variation is found within populations (Table S4, Supporting information). Estimated pairwise Fst values reveal significant genetic differentiation between weevils sampled from different host plant taxa (Table S5, Supporting information) for 23 of 28 pairwise comparisons. When haplotypes are grouped by major geographic region, these explain only 26% of the genetic variation, with more variation (33%) explained by differences among populations within regions (Table S6, Supporting information).

The covariance was not significantly different from zero (0.04, 95% HPD: –0.03–0.14), indicating there is no strong evidence of autocorrelation of rates in the phylogeny. Age estimates were made for various nodes within the tree (Fig. 2; Table 3). Due to low sample sizes we do not present age estimates for the mrca for each of lineages 2 and 7, but in both cases these were not significantly different from zero. The R. antirrhini species complex is estimated to have diverged from its sister lineage, R. griseohirta, approximately 4.26 Ma (95% HPD: 3.26–5.79), with initial diversification within R. antirrhini commencing 3.77 Ma (95% HPD: 2.91–4.80). With the exception of lineages 2 and 7, the five remaining mtDNA lineages exhibit intra-lineage variation significantly older than 130 kya, this being the lower 95% HPD value for mtDNA lineage three associated with L. genistifolia linifolia. Age estimates were produced for two additional internal nodes within the tree. The divergence between mtDNA lineages 5 and 6 associated with L. g. confertiflora and L. g. artivensis in Turkey is estimated to have occurred 1.33 Ma (95% HPD: 0.82–1.83). This clade is in turn estimated to have shared a mrca with mtDNA lineage 4, associated with L. g. genistifolia, L. d. macedonica, and L. g. sofiana in the Balkans, 1.83 Ma (95% HPD: 01.32–2.55).

spring resulting from matings of L. vulgaris origin and 53 offspring from matings of L. g. genistifolia origin. In contrast significantly reduced reproductive performance was observed for the test-crosses. Copulation was observed for only 35% of mating pairs between females collected from L. vulgaris and males from L. g. genistifolia (v2 = 7.697, p < 0.01, df = 1) and 44% of mating pairs between females from L. g. genistifolia and males from L. vulgaris (v2 = 5.555, p < 0.05, df = 1). From these observed matings only 6 females (44% of mating pairs) produced offspring for the former (v2 = 4.935, p < 0.05, df = 1), and only 1 (5% of mating pairs) for the latter (v2 = 19.79, p < 0.01, df = 1;) (Table 2).
Discussion
Genetic diversity and structure within Rhinusa antirrhini
Analyses of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences reveal high levels of genetic variation and host-associated genetic structure among sampled populations of R. antirrhini on different host plants. An average sequence divergence of 9.2% for the mtDNA COII gene exceeds values that have been observed within other weevil species complexes (e.g. Erney et al. 1996; Normark 1996; Langor & Sperling 1997; Barat et al. 2008). The comparatively lower genetic variation observed within the EF1-a sequences (average sequence divergence 0.9%) is consistent with the low levels of divergence expected for intraspecific nuclear data (Zhang & Hewitt 2003). However, it is at the same time much higher than the 0.2–0.3% divergence in EF1-a sequences reported for related weevil species using different host species of gorse (Barat et al. 2008).
Phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA COII sequences reveal clear genetic structure with six mitochondrial lineages within R. antirrhini associated with different taxa of Linaria. There is no pronounced phylogenetic signal within the EF1-a sequence data, but results from

AMOVA analysis reveal structuring of genetic variation among host plant taxa. The distinct geographic distributions of the different Linaria taxa mean that conclusions of host plant associated genetic differentiation could be confounded by geographic effects, but three lines of evidence argue against this. First, AMOVA analyses of both gene regions reveal that host plant, not geography, offers greater explanation for the structuring of genetic variation. Second, within the most geographically widespread taxa, L. vulgaris, there is little evidence for geographic structuring of genetic variation among individuals of R. antirrhini. A single individual from the more eastern Russian location does suggest the possibility of a phylogeographic east–west division. However, in comparison to the genetic differentiation observed between R. antirrhini sampled from different Linaria taxa, samples from L. vulgaris from the Balkans through to Western Europe show remarkably little differentiation among mtDNA COII haplotypes. Both these lines of evidence offer indirect support for a host plant effect over a geographic effect. The third and more direct line of evidence for host plant effect comes from weevils collected on different plants growing sympatrically. Rhinusa antirrhini were sampled from both L. vulgaris (three individuals) and L. genistifolia sofiana (three individuals) growing sympatrically on Mt Rila in Bulgaria (Fig. 1). Similarly R. antirrhini were sampled from both L. vulgaris (four individuals) and L. rubioides (three individuals) growing sympatrically in Mokra Gora in Serbia (Fig. 1). In both cases the correspondence between host plant taxa and mtDNA haplogroup is maintained (Fig. 2). Although not sampled sympatrically, both L. genistifolia artvinensis and L. genistifolia linifolia were each sampled from two locations in Turkey approximately 33 km apart. Correspondence between host plant taxa and mtDNA haplogroup is observed, despite closer geographic proximity between different plant taxon sampling sites than between same plant taxon sampling sites (Fig. 1).
Taken together our data argue for a role for ecological divergence, with different resource use being a driving agent for genetic differentiation within Rhinusa antirrhini. All but one mtDNA lineage is associated with a single taxon of Linaria, with lineage 4 being the exception. Lineage 4 includes individuals sampled within the Balkan region from Linaria genistifolia genistifolia, L. genistifolia sofiana and L. dalmatica macedonica, suggesting generalist oviposition behaviour, although two other plausible explanations cannot be rejected. It may be that there is ecological divergence within this mtDNA lineage, but of more recent origin, beyond the resolving power of mitochondrial DNA. There is also some doubt surrounding the taxonomic distinction of the three host taxa of lineage 4 (Chater et al. 1972), and it may be that
the genetic similarity of weevils across these three Linaria taxa reflects this.
Incomplete lineage sorting or gene flow?
The less evident pattern of host-associated genetic structure revealed by phylogenetic analyses of the EF1-a sequences may be a consequence of incomplete lineage sorting due to the higher effective population size and lower mutation rate of this nuclear sequence, compared to those of mitochondrial sequences (Desalle et al. 1987; Moriyama & Powell 1997; Monteiro & Pierce 2001). Alternatively, it could be that gene flow between weevils adapted to different Linaria taxa has contributed to the less pronounced pattern of genetic differentiation among Linaria taxa compared to mitochondrial DNA. This must be considered plausible as it has been suggested that host mediated selection can maintain the genetic distinction of host races even in the face of moderate gene flow (Feder et al. 1997; Filchak et al. 1999). Both incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow may well have contributed to the evolutionary history of Rhinusa antirrhini, and a consideration of the phylogenetic relationships of the allelic variation at the EF1-a locus does not favour one above the other. Considering that in a phylogenetic network interior haplotypes are older than those found at the tips (Posada & Crandall 2001b; Crandall & Templeton 1993), shared haplotypes H17 and H21 would argue for recent gene flow, whereas shared haplotypes H2, H11 and H14 suggest retained ancestral polymorphism (Fig. 3).
Results from the cross copulation experiments indicate that reproductive barriers between weevils with different host affiliation have evolved. Compared to control crosses, significantly fewer observed copulations and offspring were produced between weevils from different host plants, indicating that both pre-mating and post-mating reproductive barriers are operating. In addition to this, previous experimental observations (I. Tosˇevski, unpublished) reveal Rhinusa antirrhini to exhibit both feeding and oviposition preference for the host plant from which they are collected, thus mating among individuals with the same host preference should be more likely than mating among individuals with different host affiliation (Craig et al. 1993; Feder et al. 1994; Via 1999). However, our cross copulation experiments also demonstrate that reproductive isolation between host associated mtDNA lineages is not complete. We recognise that the ‘‘no choice’’ nature of our experiments represents an extreme situation, and that they are limited to identifying the generation of, but not the fitness of, F1 progeny. But given that the R. antirrhini complex as a whole has an estimated evolutionary history of 3.77 myr (Table 3), in the light of our results
Ó 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

several considerations suggest gene flow to be plausible within the history of this complex. First, our cross copulation experiments involved two of the more divergent host associated mtDNA lineages, representing the earliest divergence event associated with the root age of 3.77 myr. This provides a substantial amount of time for introgression, particularly so during early divergence. Second, most species diverged from each other more recently than the test-cross pair, meaning genetic incompatibilities for hybridisation are likely to be less. Third, while contemporary gene flow would be limited to contemporary sympatry, the dramatic climatic changes within Europe over the estimated 3.77 myr history of the group may have facilitated past sympatry of other Linaria taxa, and gene flow among associated R. antirrhini lineages, that are presently allopatric.
One interesting consideration is that if gene flow between host-adapted weevils has featured within the evolutionary history of this group, it has not resulted in the disruption of the relationship between mtDNA lineages and the different Linaria taxa. This in itself may be seen as evidence against a history involving gene flow, but if host choice for oviposition were sex-linked, as shown for some Lepidoptera (Scriber et al. 1991; Janz 1998), or perhaps sex-influenced, as observed in some tephritid fly host races (Craig et al. 2001), such a pattern could be maintained in the face of gene flow between host forms.
Divergence times
Our divergence time estimates suggest that Rhinusa antirrhini diverged from R. griseohirta approximately 4.26 Ma (95% HPD: 3.26–5.79), and began to diversify approximately 3.77 Ma (95% HPD: 2.91–4.80) in the middle Pliocene, with the most recent divergence event between host-associated lineages estimated to have occurred approximately 1.33 Ma (95% HPD: 0.82–1.83). However, as we have applied an extrinsic rate to estimate divergence times these must be treated with some caution. Several mtDNA lineages were sampled densely enough to permit the estimation of the age of the coalescence to the mrca (Table 3), with the youngest of these estimated to be approximately 810 kya, HPD: 0.13–1.85 Ma) indicating intra-lineage diversification dating back to the mid-Pleistocene. Extreme morphological similarity of the six host associated lineages of R. antirrhini has been maintained over the 3.77 myr period of adaptation to different Linaria taxa. However, the phylogenetic placement of the morphologically distinct R. florum (both rostrum and genitalia) within the R. antirhini complex does indicate some morphological change within the group over the last 3.77 Ma. It is interesting that R. florum is one of only two taxa sharing
a common host plant (L. genistifolia genistifolia is also used by lineage 4), suggesting a possible history of character displacement, as has been noted in other closely related sympatric plant feeding insects (Jordal et al. 2006). It would seem clear that host associated mtDNA lineages of R. antirrhini warrant consideration for elevation to species status.
Conclusion
Within plant-feeding insects, host plant specialization has long been suggested to have facilitated insect diversification (Ehrlich & Raven 1964; Bush 1969; Berlocher & Feder 2002). Endophagous insects in particular appear to be more susceptible to selective pressures imposed by their host plants due to their more intimate interaction with the host (Mopper 1996; Funk et al. 2002). Host plant selective pressure is likely to be further enhanced when endophagy is accompanied by insect-elicited plant physiological responses for successful larval development. Despite this recognition, studies of host-mediated selection in endophagous insects are scarce. Here we demonstrate host-associated genetic differentiation within a parasitic weevil whose life history is tightly linked to that of its host plant due to its ecological specialization of feeding, ovipositing, and developing within the fruit capsules of particular Linaria taxa. Our results provide evidence for ecological divergence by specializing on different resources contributing to genetic differentiation within R. antirrhini. Given the morphologically cryptic nature of host associated lineages within R. antirrhini, we advocate caution when interpreting shared morphology of insect herbivores across different plant taxa as evidence of an ecologically generalistic life history. In addition to the important task of quantifying biodiversity, this point is of particular relevance when focal taxa are potential pests, or biocontrol agents as in the case for R. antirrhini.
