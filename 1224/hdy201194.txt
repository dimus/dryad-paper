Healing quantitative trait loci in a combined cross analysis 
using related mouse strain crosses 
JM Cheverud1, HA Lawson1, R Funk2, J Zhou2, EP Blankenhorn3 and E Heber-Katz4 
Inbred mouse strains MRL and LG share the ability to fully heal ear hole punches with the full range of appropriate tissues 
without scarring. They also share a common ancestry, MRL being formed from a multi-strain cross with two final backcrosses 
to LG before being inbred by brother-sister mating. Many gene-mapping studies for healing ability have been performed using 
these two strains, resulting in the location of about 20 quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Here, we combine two of these crosses 
(N¼638), MRL/lprC57BL/6NTac and LG/JSM/J, in a single combined cross analysis to increase the mapping power, 
decrease QTL support intervals, separate multiple QTLs and establish allelic states at individual QTL. The combined cross 
analysis located 11 QTLs, 6 affecting only one cross (5 LGSM and 1 MRLB6) and 5 affecting both crosses, approximately 
the number of common QTLs expected given strain SNP similarity. Amongst the five QTLs mapped in both crosses, three had 
significantly different genetic effects, additive in one cross and over or underdominant in the other. It is possible that allelic 
states at these three loci are different in SM and B6 because they lead to differences in dominance interactions with the LG 
and MRL alleles. QTL support intervals are 40% smaller in the combined cross analysis than in either of the single crosses. 
Combined cross analysis was successful in enhancing the interpretation of earlier QTL results for these strains.

INTRODUCTION 
Ear hole closure in mammals was first identified in rabbits, where 
tissue replacement consisted of architecturally perfect tissue, including 
the re-growth of cartilage (Goss & Grimes, 1975; Labandeira-Garcia 
and Guerra-Seijas, 1986; Urist et al., 1997). Ear hole closure in the 
mouse, however, is not a general characteristic and appears to be 
unique to one strain of mouse, the MRL mouse, both MRL/lpr and 
MRL/MpJ (Desquenne-Clark et al., 1998), and its ancestral parent the 
LG/J mouse (Kench et al., 1999; Li et al., 2001). This type of healing 
has characteristics that are similar to amphibian limb regeneration. 
First, rapid re-epithelialization is seen, a breakdown in the basement 
membrane follows, and then the formation of a blastema, a key tissue 
structure in limb outgrowth in the regenerative response, begins 
(Gourevich et al., 2003). Unusual healing properties in this mouse 
strain have been reported in other tissues as well including heart 
(Leferovich et al., 2001; Naseem et al., 2007), cornea (Ueno et al., 
2005), digit (Chadwick et al., 2007; Gourevitch et al., 2009), and 
articular joint cartilage (Fitzgerald et al., 2008). 
Genetic mapping studies of ear hole closure have been carried out 
using crosses between MRL/lprC57BL/6NTac (McBrearty et al., 
1998; Blankenhorn et al., 2003), MRL/MpJSJL/J (Masinde et al., 
2001; Yu et al., 2007), MRL/MpJCAST/Ei (Heber-Katz et al., 2004; 
Yu et al., 2005), and LG/JSM/J (Blankenhorn et al., 2009). Quantitative 
trait loci (QTL) have been identified using various analyses 
including composite interval mapping (Zeng, 1994) and Bayesian 
shrinkage estimation (Yu et al., 2007). More than 20 QTL were 
identified using these techniques. The healing response was shown 
to be sexually dimorphic with females closing ear holes more 
completely, and with some QTL effects restricted to males or females 
(Blankenhorn et al., 2003). All of these crosses utilized either MRL or 
LG/J and thus the results can be compared across studies. 
In the current study, we combine data from the MRL/lprC57BL/ 
6NTac (Blankenhorn et al., 2003) and LG/JSM/J (Blankenhorn et al., 
2009) crosses in a combined cross analysis (Li et al., 2005) to 
determine the extent to which mapped QTLs are common across 
studies. Li et al., 2005 have shown that combined cross analysis can 
increase the power to detect QTLs, narrow QTL-support intervals, 
separate multiple linked QTLs and establish allelic states for haplotype 
analysis. Given that MRL/lpr and LG/J share 91% of their genome 
identical by descent (http://cgd.jax.org/straincomparison/), we expect 
that they will share some QTL map positions when crossed to the 
unrelated C57BL/6NTac and SM/J strains. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Animals 
MRL/lpr (MRL), LG/J (LG) and SM/J (SM) male and female mice were 
obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). C57BL/6NTac 
(B6) mice were obtained from Taconic Laboratories, (Hudson, 
NY, USA). (MRLB6) F1 and F2 crosses were generated at the 
Wistar Institute, whereas (LGSM) F1 crosses were generated at Washington

University, St Louis, and F2 mice were generated at the Wistar Institute. The 
sample consists of 638 F2 mice, 356 from the MRLB6 cross and 282 from the 
LGSM cross. DNA was extracted from liver and microsatellite typing was 
carried out at the Wistar Institute and Drexel University and SNP typing was 
carried out using Illumina arrays by the Wistar Genomics Core Facility. Ear 
pinnae were punched (2mm deficit) bilaterally in 6-week-old mice and read on 
day 15 and day 30 post-injury, as described in McBrearty et al. (1998). 
Mapping analysis 
The genotypes from each cross were combined in a common map using R/QTL 
(Browman and Sen, 2009) as shown in Supplementary Table 1. Genotypes and 
wound healing phenotypes are provided for all individuals in the Dryad 
repository: doi:10.5061/dryad.fh2hp7k4, with genotypes imputed at 1-cM 
intervals using the method of Haley and Knott (1992). All mapping analyses 
used the same combined genetic map. Three separate analyses were performed: 
in the LGSM cross alone, in the MRLB6 cross alone, and in the combined 
cross. The model for analyzing the separate crosses is 
Yijk¼m+Sexi+aXaj+dXdk+eijk 
where Yijk is the size of the hole at 30 days, Sexi is male or female, ‘a’ is the 
additive genotypic value (half the difference between the homozygotes), ‘d’ is 
the dominance genotypic value (deviation of the heterozygotes from the 
midpoint between the homozygotes), and eijk is the residual. Additive genotype 
scores (Xa) were +1 for the LG/LG and MRL/MRL homozygotes, 0 for the 
LG/SM and MRL/B6 heterozygotes, and –1 for the SM/SM and B6/B6 
homozygotes. Dominance genotype scores (Xd) are 0 for homozygotes and 
+1 for heterozygotes. 
After analysis of the pooled-sex model given above, we tested for genotype 
by sex interactions within each of the crosses using, 
Yijk¼m+Sexi+aXaj+dXdk+as(SexiXaj)+ds(SexiXdk)+eijk 
where ‘as’ and ‘ds’ are the additive and dominance genotype by sex interaction 
coefficients. Sex interaction’s significance was determined using the difference 
in 2ln (likelihood) between the two models distributed as w2 with 2 degrees of 
freedom. Significant interactions indicate significant differences in genetic 
effects across the sexes. When such variation is present, we mapped the genes 
separately by sex within each cross. 
We performed a combined-cross genome scan using F2 intercross animals 
from the cross of LGSM and the cross of MRLB6 together. Mapping was 
performed on the combined cross using the following model: 
Yijk¼m+Crossi+aXaj+dXdk+ac(CrossiXaj)+dc(CrossiXdk)+eijk 
where Yijk is the size of the hole at 30 days, Crossi specifies the LGSMcross or 
the MRL  B6 cross, ‘ac’ is the coefficient for the additive genotypic value by 
cross interaction, ‘dc’ is the coefficient for the dominance genotypic value by 
cross interaction, and eijk is the residual. The sexes were pooled in this 
combined analysis. Significant interaction terms indicate that the genetic effects 
are significantly different in the two crosses. 
Statistical significance was determined using the Bonferroni correction based 
on the number of independent tests in the genome scan (Cheverud, 2001; 
Li and Ji, 2005). Probabilities are presented as logarithm of probability (LPR) 
scores (¼log10(probability)), corresponding to the usual logarithm of odds 
(LOD) scores. The genome-wide LPR significance threshold is 3.29. We also 
generated chromosome-specific thresholds to avoid accumulating type 1 errors 
(Chen and Storey, 2006). In a genome scan using chromosome-specific 
thresholds, we expect one false positive chromosome by chance when there 
are no QTL effects in the population. Chromosome-specific thresholds (see 
Supplementary Table 1) range from 2.194 down to 1.895, becoming smaller for 
the shorter chromosomes. Confidence regions were defined by a one LPR drop 
on either side of the peak LPR score. 
RESULTS 
LGSM intercross QTL 
There were 12 QTLs mapped to chromosomes (chr) 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 
(3 loci), 11, 14, 18 and 19 in the LGSM intercross (see Table 1; see 
Figure 1a). The LG allele significantly improves healing on 
chromosomes 2, 6, 9, 11 and 18, whereas at the three chr 10 QTLs, 
the SM allele improves healing. The average absolute additive 
genotypic value for QTLs with significant additive (a) effects is 
small, 0.15mm, representing a 0.30mm difference in extent of 
healing between LG and SM homozygotes at a single QTL 
locus. On an s.d. scale, significant differences between homozygotes 
range from 0.25 to 0.66 s.d. units. The average QTL support interval is 
23 cM. 
QTLs on chromosomes 6, 9, proximal 10, distal 10 and 18 are codominant, 
whereas the chr 2 and mid-chr 10 QTLs are LG/J dominant 
and the chr 11 QTL is SM/J dominant. The better-healing phenotype 
is recessive at mid-chr 10 and chr 11, and dominant on chr 2. Four 
QTLs (chromosomes 4, 8, 14 and 19) are only significant for the 
dominance term, three being underdominant (chromosomes 4, 14, 
19), the heterozygote healing relatively poorly and one overdominant 
(chr 8), the heterozygotes healing more fully than the homozygotes. 
The absolute size of significant dominance effects are similar to those 
observed for additive effects.

Two chromosomes (chr 2 with LPR¼2.695 and chr 9 with LPR 
1.76) had significant genotype by sex interactions. Chr 2 was significant 
only in males and chr 9, although significant in both males 
and females, exhibited sex-specific peaks at 30 and 57 cM, respectively. 
The confidence interval for the females on chr 9 is quite refined, from 
54 to 63 cM, whereas the confidence region for the males is broad (24 
to 66 cM) and is likely due to more than one quantitative trait gene 
within the interval. The chr 9 effect is also stronger in females than in 
males, including both additive and dominance genetic components. 
Certainly, the genetics of chromosome 9 are complex and will require 
further recombination to resolve. In addition, the LPRs for females 
were greater than for males for all three chromosome 10 QTLs 
whereas the reverse was true for the chromosome 11 QTL, even 
though additive and dominance effect estimates were quite similar 
across the sexes. 
MRLB6 intercross QTL 
The MRLB6 intercross produced 10 QTLs on chromosomes 1, 4, 8, 9, 
11, 12, 13, 16 and 18 (2 QTLs) (see Table 2; Figure 1b). Alleles from the 
healing strain, MRL, improved healing at four loci (chromosomes 4, 11, 
13 and proximal 18) whereas the B6 allele promoted healing on 
chromosomes 8, 12 and 16. The two QTLs on chr 18, labeled as 
proximal and distal, are only 20 cM apart and have overlapping 
confidence regions and thus should only be considered provisionally 
distinct. However, the genetic effects are quite different at the two 
locations, in that the proximal QTL affects both sexes and has a strong 
additive effect whereas the more distal location only affects females and 
has an overdominant effect with heterozygotes healing well. The average 
absolute additive genotypic value for QTLs with significant additive (a) 
effects is only 0.11 mm, representing a 0.22mm difference in extent of 
healing between MRL and B6 homozygotes at individual QTLs. On a 
s.d. scale, significant differences between homozygotes range from 0.20 
to 0.43 s.d. units. QTL support intervals averaged 25 cM. 
Four of the loci (chromosomes 4, 8, 11 and 12) are co-dominant 
with healing intermediate in the heterozygotes, whereas chr 1 and chr 9 
are underdominant, the heterozygotes healing poorly relative to both 
homozygotes, and distal chr 18 is overdominant, the heterozygotes 
healing more completely than either homozygote. On chr 13 the healpromoting 
MRL allele is dominant to the B6 allele and on chr 16 the 
non-healing MRL allele is dominant to the B6 allele. Absolute 
dominance genotypic values range from 0.08 to 0.24mm or 0.2 to 
0.6 s.d. units. 
Half of the QTLs in the MRL/J by C57BL/6J cross affect both 
sexes (chromosomes 4, 8, 12, 13 and proximal 18) whereas the 
other half are sex-specific (chr 1 (LPR for sex interaction¼1.94), 
chr 9 (LPR¼2.95), chr 11 (LPR¼2.06), chr 16 (LPR¼1.54) and 
distal chr 18 (LPR¼2.76)), three with male-specific effects (chromosomes 
9, 11 and 16) and two with female-specific effects (chr 1 and 
distal chr 18). 
Combined cross-analysis 
The combined cross-genome scan identified 11 QTLs on chromosomes 
4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18 and 19, including three distinct 
peaks on chr 10 (see Table 3; Figure 1c). Five of these 11 were 
significant at the genome-wide level whereas 6 were significant at 
the chromosome-specific level. The average support interval is 
15 cM. Of these 11 QTLs, 9 had significant cross by genotype interactions 
indicating differential mapping in the two crosses. Five of 
these nine were loci that mapped in the LGSM cross but not in 
the MRLB6 cross, three on chr 10, and one each on chr 14 and 
chr 19, one that mapped only in the MRLB6 cross (chr 13), and 
three (chromosomes 4, 8 and 9) that mapped in both crosses to the 
same locations but displayed different patterns of genetic effects in 
the two intercrosses. The significance of the differences in effects 
on chromosomes 4, 8 and 9 is indicated by their significant interaction 
LPR scores (‘ac’ and ‘dc’). On chromosomes 4 and 8 the 
MRLB6 intercross displayed additive effects whereas LGSM intercross 
displayed underdominance and overdominance, respectively. 
On chr 9 the effect was additive in the LGSM intercross and 
under-dominant in the MRLB6 intercross. Loci were also mapped 
in the separate crosses that were not significant in the combined-cross 
analysis, including QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 6 in the LGSM 
intercross and QTLs in the MRLB6 intercross on chromosomes 1, 
12, 16 and distal 18.

Overall, in the three analyses there were 17 QTLs discovered with 7 
specific to the LG/J by SM/J cross, 5 to the MRL by C57BL/6J cross, 
and five locations where QTLs mapped in both crosses, although 
genetic patterns of variation differed between the crosses at three of 
these common localities. 
DISCUSSION 
Each of the two crosses contain a similar number of QTLs, 12 in 
the LG  SM cross and 10 in the MRLB6 cross. Five QTLs are 
shared between strains. Estimates based on SNP genotypes for inbred 
strains scored for the 623 000 SNPs on the Mouse Genetic Diversity 
Array (Yang et al., 2009) indicate that approximately 67% of the 
genome is identical by descent among unrelated strains. LG and 
MRL share 91% of their genomes identical by descent: 100% in 
identical regions directly shared due to genealogy (75% of the 
genome) and 67% identity in the remaining 25% of the genome 
(1.000.75+0.670.25¼0.91). Given these values, we expect the 
two crosses to share about 41% (¼0.910.670.67) of their 
QTLs. With 11 QTLs in the combined cross analysis, we expect 4.5 
shared QTLs and we observe five shared positions. This result is 
approximately what would be expected, given the proportions of 
shared and distinct SNPs among the strains in these crosses. Even 
then, the genetic effects at three of these five shared locations 
(chromosomes 4, 8 and 9) differ raising the possibility that they 
represent the effects of different linked loci. Using the 13 377 Oxford/ 
CTC SNPs (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/INBREDS/) scored in 
LG/J and MRL/MpJ, it is possible to determine whether there is 
potential polymorphism between LG and MRL within the confidence 
regions of these shared QTLs with different effects. There 
are no polymorphic SNPs in the confidence regions of the chr 4 
(140–155Mb) and chr 9 (84–118Mb) QTLs so differences in genetic 
effects at these loci are unlikely to be due to different linked genes 
mapping in the two crosses. The chr 8 QTL is polymorphic over 
40% of its confidence region, with polymorphic blocks present 
ranging from 61 to 83.7Mb and from 109 to 128Mb, and monomorphic 
over the remaining 60% of the interval. The chr 8 peak is 
near 96.5Mb, within the monomorphic interval. Given that LG and 
MRL carry the same genotypes at these three QTLs, the observed 
differences in genetic effects in the two crosses could be due to 
different alleles in the B6 and SM strains that interact differently 
with the common LG/MRL allele or epistatic interactions with other 
loci that are different in the two crosses.

Healing loci in LG/J and MRL/J 
JM Cheverud et al

Heredity

Overall, both LG and MRL alleles usually promote healing, 
although there are several QTL in both crosses where the healing 
allele comes from the alternate strain. Dominance is variable with 
most loci having co-dominant alleles. When there is dominance, it is 
most typical for the healing allele to be recessive with heterozygotes 
healing poorly relative to the midpoint between the parental strains. 
There are also several loci for which the heterozygote heals either 
better than or worse than both homozygotes. 
Effects found in each strain vary from 0.2 to 0.6 s.d. units and 
percentage effects because of individual QTL vary from 2 to 17%, 
whereas overall about 65% of the phenotypic variance in each cross is 
accounted for by the QTLs. Thus each cross is approximately as 
powerful as the other in detecting QTL. These values are probably an 
overestimate of phenotypic variance and allelic effects because some 
QTLs are linked, such as those on chromosome 10 in the LG/J by SM/J 
cross, and sample sizes in the separate crosses, whereas substantial, can 
still lead to an inflation of allelic effects and of variance explained 
(Beavis, 1994). Together, we find 50–100% more QTLs than are found 
in each single cross alone showing the value of mapping in multiple, 
related crosses. Each cross can bring out different healing alleles 
depending on which loci happen to be the variable between the 
parental strains tested. Furthermore, QTL support intervals average 
37.5% narrower in the combined cross (15 cM) than in the individual 
cross analyses (24 cM). Even then, the reduced intervals contain large 
numbers of genes. To identify the genes responsible for these QTL 
more recombination is required. Ongoing studies in the LG, SM 
Advanced Intercross Line will serve this purpose. 
Overall, the results of the two crosses are similar. However, one clear 
difference is that there are many more genetic variations in sexual 
dimorphism in the MRLB6 cross with five sex-specific QTLs, than in 
the LG/J by SM/J cross with only one or two sex-specific effects. The 
sexes are dimorphic in both crosses (Blankenhorn et al., 2003, 2009), 
but only the MRLB6 cross harbors much genetic variation in sexual 
dimorphism. This difference between strains likely indicates differences 
in the interactions between steroid hormones and variable loci 
in the two crosses. 
The results for chr 9 seem very complex. It is most likely that there 
are at least two loci, one with larger effects in males than in females 
in the mid-portion of the chromosome and another with larger 
effects in females than in males on the distal portion of the chromosome. 
Chr 10 is also complex. Three peaks, with non-overlapping 
confidence regions, occur at 20 cM intervals along the mid-section 
of the chromosome. All three QTL show the same additive effect, 
with the SM/J allele promoting healing. The proximal and distal 
locations have co-dominant effects, whereas at the middle QTL the 
non-healing LG/J allele is dominant. There is not enough precision 
in this F2 population to securely locate these closely linked QTLs 
relative to one another. We expect that the accumulation of recombination 
in later generations of the LG by SM intercross will clarify 
these results. 
Additional support exists for the likely identity of two genes 
underlying the QTLs on chr 11 and chr 18 in the combined cross 
analysis. Both of these QTL share similar dominance and additivity, 
and with the exception that there is a more pronounced male-specific 
effect in the MRLxB6 cross for Heal10 on chr 11. Indeed, there is a 
significant male-preference of the QTL in the LGSM cross when 
assessed by composite interval mapping (Blankenhorn et al., 2009) 
and in an MRL/MpJCAST/Ei cross (Heber-Katz et al., 2004). Taken 
together, evidence points to two closely linked QTL on chr11, a 
relatively strong one that is male-specific and an additional QTL 
that is weaker and acts in mice of both sexes. Heal9, on proximal 
chr18, shares all major genetic parameters in both crosses. Such 
concordance will make it possible to perform comparative haplotype 
association mapping studies (Burgess-Herbert et al., 2008) to 
further narrow the list of candidate genes in the supported intervals 
to those that share alleles between LG and MRL vs CAST/Ei, SM/J 
and C57BL/6J. 
Most of the QTLs identified here have been previously reported in 
single cross analyses (see Tables 1–3; McBrearty et al., 1998; Masinde 
et al., 2001; Blankenhorn et al., 2003, 2009; Heber-Katz et al., 2004; Yu 
et al., 2007). However, several new results are also reported. These new 
results are most likely due to differences in the analytical methods, 
significance thresholds and sample sizes applied. We identified a QTL 
on chr 6 (LPR¼2.27) in the LGSM cross as significant at the 
chromosome-wide level that was sub-significant according to the 
criteria used by Blankenhorn et al. (2009), a third more distal QTL 
on chr 10 (LPR¼4.68) that is in linkage disequilibrium with the two 
more proximal QTLs on chr 10 reported by Blankenhorn et al. (2009), 
and a new QTL on chr 19 (LPR¼3.00). The chromosome 10 and 19 
QTLs were also significant in the combined-cross analysis with cross 
by genotype interactions, bolstering support for these locations. Two 
new locations on chr 1 (LPR¼2.36) and chr 12 (LPR¼2.01) that are 
significant at the chromosome-wide level are also reported for the 
MRL  B6 cross. Although other healing QTLs have been reported on 
these chromosomes, Sth1 and Heal5, respectively, the locations 
reported here are distant from their positions. These new results are 
most likely due to differences in the analytical methods and significance 
thresholds applied. For example, Blankenhorn et al. (2009), 
utilized composite interval mapping (Zeng, 1994) and determined 
significance at genome-wide a¼0.32, 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01 levels 
utilizing permutation analysis (Wang et al., 2009), rather than using 
interval mapping and chromosome-wide thresholds as done here. 
In the combined cross analysis we have provided novel results, not 
evident in earlier analyses of these crosses (Blankenhorn et al., 2003, 
2009): (1)We confirmed that many QTL mapped in the LGSM cross 
are not also present in the MRLB6 cross and vice versa, as evinced by 
significant cross by genotype interactions; (2) QTL support intervals 
are 37.5% smaller in the combined cross than in the separate crosses 
(15 vs 24 cM); (3) Even when QTLs map to the same location in the 
two crosses, there can be significant differences in gene effects at the 
loci suggesting different alleles in SM and B6 at these loci or different 
epistatic interactions with the background; (4) Loci on chr 11 and chr 
18 have the same allelic contrasts in the two crosses; and (5) Two new 
QTL loci, distal chr 10 and chr 19, were identified by using different 
analytical and significance testing approaches.
