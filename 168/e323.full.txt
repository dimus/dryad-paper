• Premise of the study: Microsatellite primers were developed for the Pacific Northwest conifer, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (Cupressaceae), to enhance efficiencies in disease-resistance breeding and germplasm screening for gene conservation of this rare species.
• Methods and Results: Using multiplexed massively parallel Illumina sequencing, we identified over 300000 microsatellitecontaining sequences from 2 million paired-end microreads. After stringent filtering and primer evaluation, we selected 11 primer pairs and used these to screen variation in four populations of C. lawsoniana. Loci show between three and 10 repeats per locus, with an average of eight. Screening of these markers in the North American relative Callitropsis nootkatensis demonstrated limited marker transferability, but these markers could have utility in Asian species of Chamaecyparis.
• Conclusions: These microsatellite primers show high polymorphism and should provide a high level of individual discrimination for paternity analysis in defined pedigrees, and routine screening of wild variation in Chamaecyparis lawsoniana.

Port Orford cedar (POC), Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murray) Parl. (Cupressaceae), is an ecologically and economically important species that has a distribution limited to riparian zones, coastal marine terraces, and serpentine soils of southwestern Oregon and northwestern California (Zobel et al., 1985). An introduced, highly virulent root disease (Phytophthora lateralis) has impacted populations of POC across much of its range, and mortality from this disease limits growth and yield in areas where POC has its greatest potential. Declines in this species have motivated recovery efforts by federal land management agencies (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2004).
Following the identification of native P. lateralis resistance, the USDA Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management initiated a resistance breeding program at the Dorena Genetic Resource Center (Dorena GRC; Cottage Grove, Oregon, USA), with the goal of developing populations of resistant trees that can be planted in high-risk areas and that preserve the genetic variability and adaptability in this endemic conifer (Hansen et al., 2000; Sniezko, 2006).

Dorena GRC and the USFS Forest Health and Protection program, we have developed microsatellite markers for POC that can validate breeding strategies and resistant-germplasm management, and provide quantitative measures of gene conservation targets.
METHODS AND RESULTS
Genomic DNA of the highly P. lateralis-resistant clone 117490 (Dorena GRC; OSC voucher 232031) forms the basis of this library and originated from the Powers Ranger District in southwestern Oregon, USA (approximately 42.378°N, 124.282°W). Total genomic DNA was extracted from stem and leaf tissue using the FastDNA kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio, USA), and microsatellites were isolated and sequenced using multiplexed massively parallel sequencing of 80 bp paired ends on the Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA), as described by Jennings et al. (2011). Briefly, this approach combines microsatellite enrichment using biotinylated probes (5′-[Biotin](CT)15, 5′-[Biotin](GT)15, and 5′-[Biotin](CA)15) with massively parallel sequencing to generate a large library of microsatellite containing microreads 160 bp in length.
Out of the 2 million total microreads obtained from this barcoded library, 297747 contained dinucleotide and trinucleotide microsatellites with a repeat length ≥ 4. To reduce the size of this data set, we removed duplicate sequences using the program CD-HIT-454 (Niu et al., 2010), and focused on repeat-containing sequences that had a microsatellite repeat located near the center of the sequenced fragment (Jennings et al., 2011). This produced a data set containing 2875 high quality sequences, and these were used for primer design using the program BatchPrimer3 (You et al., 2008). Default parameters were selected for all but the following variables: product length (min = 100 bp, max = 200 bp), primer length (min = 17 bp, max = 25 bp, optimum = 19 bp), melting temperature (min = 48°C, max = 63°C, optimum = 54°C), and number of primers per sequence = 1. Experimental details and the scripts used to select microsatellites are detailed in Jennings et al. (2011). Microreads from this experiment are archived in the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI accession number

One hundred forty-four primer pairs were selected for initial screening against four POC DNAs selected from the geographic range of the species. These primers were screened using a PTC-200 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA) in 10 μL reactions that contained 1–10 ng of genomic DNA (approximate), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 μM fluorescent primer, and 5 μL of 2× Phusion Flash Taq polymerase mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA). Cycling conditions used an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 62°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 5 s, with a final extension of 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were screened on 3% agarose/Tris-Acetate-EDTA gels to identify and remove from consideration primer combinations that yielded weak amplification products or multibanded phenotypes; based on this filter, we discarded 123 loci, almost exclusively due to multibanded phenotypes. As noted in Jennings et al. (2011), multibanded phenotypes are commonly observed in microsatellite libraries derived from large conifer genomes, and these likely represent abundant repetitive elements. The software we used to remove duplicate microreads (CD-HIT-454; Niu et al., 2010) does provide information on the frequency of
each sequence in the read pool. We did not incorporate repeat abundance information in our primer selection strategy, but we suspect that selecting unique to rare (presumably low copy) repeats for primer design would improve the recovery of interpretable microsatellites.
For the 21 markers meeting our selection criteria (strong amplification; simple banding phenotype), the forward primer of each primer pair was labeled with a fluorophore (FAM or HEX; Integrated DNA Technologies, Corallville, Iowa, USA). These 21 marker loci were screened using 64 POC individuals collected from four populations, with 16 individuals per population: 1 = Shore Acres State Park, Oregon (43.3142°N, 124.3930°W); 2 = Coos County, Oregon (43.2571°N, 124.3099°W); 3 = Weaver-Sitkum, Oregon (43.1078°N, 123.8607°W); 4 = Johnson Mountain, Oregon (42.8228°N, 124.0765°W). Specimen vouchers are not available for these individuals, due to the small tissue samples collected. Cross-species amplification of primers was evaluated using four individuals of yellow cedar (YC; Callitropsis nootkatensis (D. Don) Florin ex D. P. Little; OSC voucher OSC232031) from southeastern Alaska. Microsatellite fragment sizes were determined on the ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) using GeneMapper 4.0 and ROX500 (Applied Biosystems) internal size standards. Detailed collection information and genotypes for all individuals are deposited in the

Across the tested populations, we found that 11 of 21 primer pairs yielded consistent amplification products and could be scored using a diploid locus/ allele model (Table 1). The number of alleles (Na) and heterozygosities (observed [Ho] and expected [He]) were obtained for these 11 loci using GenAlEx version 6.4 (Peakall and Smouse, 2006) (Table 2). In our sample of 64 individuals, the number of alleles varied from three to 39 per polymorphic locus (Table 1), and the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.125 to 1.0 and 0.188 to 0.938, respectively. Tests for deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium were conducted using PowerMarker version 3.25 (Liu and Muse, 2005). POC shows a mixed mating system that produces outcrossed and selfed progeny (Millar and Marshall, 1991); as such, deviations from HWE are not unexpected, and in fact were observed at nine of the 11 loci. Tests of linkage disequilibrium were not significant for most pairs of loci, although POC-TTC1.7–POC-58, POC-55– POC-58, and POC-42–POC-58 remained significant (P > 0.0001) after sequential Bonferroni correction. Of the 11 primer pairs tested on YC, only two (POC-42 and POC-55) showed reliable amplification. Both of these loci were polymorphic, showing three alleles in a sample of four individuals (Table 1).
CONCLUSIONS
The future health of POC is dependent on active management that includes screening for P. lateralis resistance, increasing the frequency of resistance in restoration seed sources, and deployment of adapted germplasm into suitable habitat (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2004). The microsatellites we have developed for POC show high polymorphism and should provide a high level of discrimination for paternity analysis in defined pedigrees, routine screening of wild variation in C. lawsoniana, and will provide additional confidence in the deployment of adapted germplasm into restored populations.
