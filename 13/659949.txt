 abstract: Theory predicts that costly sexual displays should evolve condition dependence if the marginal fitness gain from trait exaggeration is greater for highthan for low-condition individuals and that the strength of condition dependence should increase with the strength of directional selection. While there is substantial support for the first prediction, evidence for the latter is much weaker. We undertook a quantitative test of this prediction for a multivariate sexual display consisting of a suite of contact pheromones termed “cuticular hydrocarbons” (CHCs) in Drosophila serrata. We performed a dietary manipulation of condition (i.e., the pool of metabolic resources available for allocation to fitness-enhancing traits) within a half-sibling breeding design, thereby also providing insight into the genetic basis of condition dependence. As predicted, the linear combination of CHCs under the strongest sexual selection from female mate preferences was unusually condition dependent relative to other CHC combinations within the population (P p .049). A significant positive correlation also existed between the strengths of condition dependence and sexual selection among different CHC blends (r p 0.482, P ! .001). Finally, sires varied in their response to the dietary manipulation, demonstrating significant genetic variance in condition dependence. Our results are consistent with the evolution of heightened condition dependence of sexual displays in response to persistent sexual selection.

 the trait as much as they can afford (Andersson 1982; Nur and Hasson 1984). Theory predicts that the expression of such traits should evolve to be condition dependent if the marginal fitness gain of trait exaggeration is greater for highthan for low-condition individuals (Getty 1998, 2006; Proulx et al. 2002).
With respect to condition-dependent trait expression, attention has been focused in particular on male traits involved in courtship and mate acquisition (e.g., morphological, visual, chemical, and acoustic displays) because such traits are often targets of persistent and directional sexual selection. Such selection will drive their exaggeration to the point at which their benefit to sexual fitness is offset by their cost to nonsexual fitness (i.e., until natural selection balances sexual selection; Kirkpatrick and Ryan 1991; Andersson 1994), making such traits costly (Rowe and Houle 1996). If the marginal cost of trait exaggeration is lower for high-condition males (or the marginal fitness gain is higher; Getty 1998, 2006; Proulx et al. 2002), then these displays will be reliable indicators of a male’s phenotypic and/or genetic quality (Zahavi 1975; Andersson 1986; Grafen 1990a, 1990b; Iwasa and Pomiankowski 1994; Rowe and Houle 1996). As condition dependence evolves, genetic variance in overall condition is converted into variation in the male trait in a process called “genic capture” (Rowe and Houle 1996). Condition dependence therefore has implications for the maintenance of genetic variance in sexual display traits in particular and in lifehistory traits in general (Rowe and Houle 1996; Houle 1998; Tomkins et al. 2004). Under such conditions, females can benefit by using these displays when choosing mates, making condition dependence central to the evolution of mate choice and potentially to population mean fitness (Proulx 1999, 2001, 2002; Whitlock 2000; Lorch et al. 2003) and even the evolution of sex (Agrawal 2001; Siller 2001).
In contrast to traits that are under persistent directional selection, traits that are experiencing stabilizing or otherwise weak selection are not expected to evolve condition dependence because allocating more resources to such
 Introduction
Condition can be defined as the pool of metabolic resources available to an individual for allocation to the production and maintenance of the traits that determine their fitness (Rowe and Houle 1996; Tomkins et al. 2004). Differences in condition among individuals arise from genetic and environmental variance in their acquisition and/ or assimilation of resources. For traits subject to directional selection, fitness is an increasing function of investment in the trait, favoring individuals that allocate to

 traits does not increase fitness. In general, given that sexual display traits are common targets of persistent directional selection, such traits are expected to exhibit heightened condition dependence relative to other traits that are less closely associated with fitness (Pomiankowski 1987; Grafen 1990a, 1990b; Iwasa and Pomiankowski 1994). More specifically, the marginal gain in fitness from trait exaggeration should be greater for a trait under stronger as opposed to weaker directional selection, and all else being equal the former trait should therefore evolve to be more sensitive to condition than the latter. Among traits, therefore, the strength of condition-dependent expression should increase as the strength of sexual selection increases, although the degree to which such relationships may be obscured by other differences among traits (e.g., genetic architecture and past selection) is not known.
Numerous studies have experimentally altered condition, often through the use of different-quality diets, and examined the effect on one or more sexual traits. Unfortunately, many of these studies suffered from a number of shortcomings, and compelling manipulative evidence that sexual traits exhibit heightened condition dependence is limited (Cotton et al. 2004). Although some of the concerns raised by Cotton et al. (2004) have been addressed in several recent studies (e.g., Bonduriansky and Rowe 2005; Kemp and Rutowski 2007; Siitari et al. 2007; Kemp 2008; Peters et al. 2008; Punzalan et al. 2008; McGuigan 2009; Smith and Greig 2010; Tibbetts 2010; Wyman et al. 2010), conspicuous gaps in our knowledge remain. For example, the standard experimental approach compares the extent of condition-dependent expression of sexual traits with that of one or more nonsexual traits. As nonsexual traits, such comparisons often employ the homologous traits in females or other nonsexual traits in males, on the presumption that directional selection is weaker or absent on them (but see Punzalan et al. 2008; McGuigan 2009). While useful, such comparisons often rest on an untested assumption concerning the strength of selection on these traits and therefore cannot be used to estimate the relationship between the strengths of condition dependence and selection.
In addition, like many signaling systems male sexual displays are often composed of multiple components that are used simultaneously to attract or court females (Candolin 2003), and female mate preference often acts on multiple traits (Brooks and Endler 2001; Chenoweth and Blows 2006). The phenotypic and genetic covariances among these traits necessitate a multivariate approach to their analysis, including estimates of selection (Lande and Arnold 1983). Unfortunately, the multicomponent aspect of male sexual displays has often been overlooked in studies of condition dependence, with the majority of work focusing on single-trait comparisons (Cotton et al. 2004).
 When multiple traits have been considered, analyses are often conducted separately or on a limited number of composite traits (but see McGuigan 2009). The importance of adopting a multivariate perspective, both in general and in the study of sexual selection and condition dependence in particular, is well attested to by the apparent lack of genetic variance in the multivariate direction of selection on combinations of traits for which there is ample genetic variance individually (Walsh and Blows 2009), a result suggesting that condition dependence may not be able to maintain genetic variation in the face of persistent and strong directional selection. We return to this topic in “Discussion.”
Finally, the genetic basis of condition dependence has received limited attention. Genetic variance in condition dependence is required for its evolution, and the rapid divergence among species of sexual traits in particular suggests that condition dependence for particular traits may strengthen and weaken relatively rapidly. In addition, condition dependence likely evolves in response to sex-specific selection that will also favor the evolution of sexual dimorphism. The process of genic capture may therefore go hand-in-hand with the breakdown of the intersex genetic correlations that impede sex-specific trait evolution, resulting in condition-dependent sexual dimorphism due to a shared genetic basis of these phenomena (Bonduriansky 2007a). Genetic variance in condition dependence has been demonstrated for male eye span in stalk-eyed flies (Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni; David et al. 2000), and condition dependence and sexual dimorphism have been shown to covary in two other fly species, suggesting their common genetic basis (Bonduriansky and Rowe 2005; Bondurianksy 2007b). The genetic basis of condition dependence is a topic in need of additional investigation.
Here, using the Australian fruit fly Drosophila serrata, we investigated condition dependence and its genetic basis for a multicomponent sexual display consisting of a suite of contact pheromones termed “cuticular hydrocarbons” (CHCs). Drosophila serrata use CHCs both in mate choice within populations (Chenoweth and Blows 2003, 2005) and in species recognition (Blows and Allan 1998; Higgie et al. 2000). Via a series of quantitative genetic and manipulative evolutionary experiments, particular combinations or blends of CHCs in males have been shown to be the direct target of female mate preferences, generating consistent and often strong directional sexual selection on these traits (Higgie et al. 2000; Chenoweth and Blows 2003, 2005; Higgie and Blows 2007, 2008; Rundle et al. 2009; Delcourt et al. 2010). The relative concentrations of three CHCs have been found to correlate positively with wing size (an index of body size) in field-raised males, suggesting that they are condition dependent in their expression

 (Hine et al. 2004). Direct manipulative tests of condition dependence are lacking in the species, although they have been undertaken for both CHCs and wing shape in a close relative, Drosophila bunnanda (Van Homrigh et al. 2007; McGuigan 2009). The relationship between the strength of condition dependence and the strength of sexual selection has not been explored in either species.
Our experiment used dietary manipulation of condition conducted within the context of a half-sibling breeding design (e.g., David et al. 2000), measuring the CHCs of sons from the breeding design raised in a highor lowquality environment. We also quantified sexual selection on this suite of CHCs directly via a female-choice mating assay using daughters from the same breeding design (see Delcourt et al. 2010), providing an estimate of the linear combination of male CHCs that females prefer most (i.e., the blend of CHCs that makes males most attractive). We then compared the strength of condition dependence for various CHC blends that exist within the population (each representing a separate vector through the multidimensional phenotypic space of male CHCs), asking whether the particular combination of CHCs that females most prefer is more condition dependent than other possible blends among which they could choose. Use of different combinations of CHCs provides an internal comparison that is preferable to the use, as a control, of another class of traits (e.g., morphology or behavior) that may be developmentally more or less sensitive to diet manipulation of condition for reasons other than their history of selection. By combining the results of the selection assay and the diet manipulation, we also directly quantified the relationship between the strength of condition dependence and the strength of sexual selection among these different CHC blends. Finally, taking advantage of the breeding design we employed a standard quantitative genetic method for quantifying genotype # environment interactions to estimate genetic variance in CHC condition dependence (Tomkins et al. 2004).
Material and Methods
Breeding Design
Using a previously described laboratory population of Drosophila serrata (Rundle et al. 2006), we implemented a paternal half-sibling breeding design across two different larval food environments: (1) standard yeast-based food on which the population had been maintained for 12 years and to which it was therefore presumably well adapted and (2) novel corn flour–based food. The effects of these environments on male condition were evaluated in a separate assay (see the appendix). Ninety-two sires were each mated to four virgin females (dams), and these females
 were allowed to oviposit for 20 h in one environment (corn or yeast food) and then for 48 h in the alternative environment. The order of oviposition environments was alternated among females, and the longer oviposition time in the second environment ensured similar larval rearing densities given the decline in the female egg-laying rate with time. The breeding design was implemented in three blocks consisting of 30, 31, and 31 sires that spanned five generations of the laboratory population. The genetic basis of male and female fitness has been previously quantified using sons and daughters from this breeding design (Delcourt et al. 2009), as has the genetic basis of female mate preferences for male CHCs (Delcourt et al. 2010). Here we used novel data collected from separate sons to examine the genetic basis of male CHCs as expressed during sexual encounters. These data were combined with the previous preference data (from which we derived direct estimates of sexual selection on these traits; Delcourt et al. 2010) to investigate the condition dependence of male CHCs. The number of sires in the current data set (91) differed from that in the previous fitness and preference data sets (Delcourt et al. 2009, 2010) because of incomplete records for some sires.
Male Display Assay
Male CHC displays were assayed on 3-day-old virgin sons from each half-sib family, raised in each environment, that were collected at emergence and separated by sex using light CO2 anesthesia. These males were held in vials in groups of five on their respective larval food medium with abundant live yeast sprinkled on top. Male CHCs were estimated within the context of a sexual encounter by presenting each son separately in a vial to two virgin females of the same age that were randomly chosen from the stock population. Vials were observed until the male successfully mated with one of the two females, at which point the male was removed for CHC extraction using CO2 anesthesia and the females were discarded. Mating vials contained food that matched the environment in which the son was raised (i.e., yeast or corn). An average of 3.1 􏱠 0.8 (SD) replicate mating trials were conducted using separate sons from each dam raised in each environment, generating 12,300 males for CHC extraction.
CHCs were extracted by immersing individuals in 100 mL of hexane for ∼3 min and then vortexing them for 1 min. Individuals were then removed, and samples were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph, as described elsewhere (Delcourt et al. 2010). Individual CHC profiles were determined by integration of the area under nine peaks corresponding to those used in the preference analyses (Delcourt et al. 2010) and identified in order of their retention times as follows: (Z,Z)-

After integration, CHCs were expressed as a proportion of the total CHC abundance for each individual to control for variation in both the extraction process and gas chromatographic analysis. Such controls are less prone to experimental error than the use of internal standards (Blows and Allan 1998; Savarit and Ferveur 2002). To break the unit-sum constraint, proportions were transformed to logcontrasts using (Z,Z)-5,9C24:2 as the divisor, thereby permitting multivariate analyses to be performed (Atchison 1986).
Genetic Analyses
The additive genetic variance-covariance (i.e., G) matrix for the eight logcontrast CHCs in males was estimated via restricted maximum likelihood at the sire level separately for each environment. We employed the factor-analytic modeling approach implemented in the MIXED procedure of SAS (ver. 9.2; SAS Institute; Hine and Blows 2006; McGuigan and Blows 2007). The model was

(1)
where Yijklmn is the observed standardized logcontrast value of the ith CHC (i p 1 to 8) from the jth offspring of the lth dam (D) nested within the kth sire (S); 􏴓 is unexplained error. Fixed effects include the intercept (m), experimental block (B), order of oviposition environments (O), and their interaction. Before analysis, logcontrast values of each of the eight CHCs were standardized (∼N(0, 1)) separately by environment. The factor-analytic approach ensures that the resulting covariance matrix (G) is positive semidefinite (i.e., all eigenvalues were greater than or equal to 0; Kirkpatrick and Meyer 2004). It also provides a means of directly testing the dimensionality of G by constraining the covariance matrix to be from zero to eight dimensions and using a series of nested likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) to
 determine whether excluding each dimension significantly worsens the fit of the model (Hine and Blows 2006). In these analyses, the dam effect was fixed at six dimensions in both corn and yeast, corresponding to their number of eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues.
As a direct test for genetic variance in CHC condition dependence, we employed a standard technique for detecting genotype # environment interactions (Lynch and Walsh 1998; Tomkins et al. 2004). Data were combined across environments and standardized globally (∼N(0, 1)). Sire # environment and dam # environment random-effect terms were then added to equation (1), along with the fixed effect of environment, and the factoranalytic modeling approach was used to conduct a series of nested LRTs of the significance of the eigenvectors at the sire # environment level. The first eigenvector of the sire # environment matrix, for example, represents the trait (i.e., linear combination of logcontrast CHCs) for which sires vary most in their responses to the two environments—or, in other words, for which additive genetic variance in condition dependence is greatest. For this analysis, the sire, dam, and dam # environment effects were each fixed at five dimensions, corresponding to their respective number of eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues. The estimate of the first eigenvector presented in “Results” was obtained from a model with five dimensions at the sire # environment levels to avoid biases that can result from underfitting the number of genetic dimensions (Meyer and Kirkpatrick 2008).
Phenotypic Analyses
We compared the extent of condition dependence and its relationship with the strength of directional sexual selection for various traits in males representing different linear combinations of the eight logcontrast CHCs, including the combination under the strongest directional selection (i.e., the most attractive blend of male CHCs). The latter was estimated using previously published preference data (Del-

 court et al. 2010). In brief, from the current breeding design five virgin daughters from each half-sibling family were used individually in separate mate-choice trials with five randomly chosen virgin stock males. CHCs were quantified from the chosen male and one of the four (randomly selected) rejected males. Although male-male competition could, in theory, affect the outcome of such trials, several lines of evidence suggest that this assay successfully measures female choice in this species (Delcourt et al. 2010). Here we ignored the fact that the females came from the breeding design and used a standard first-order multiple regression (Lande and Arnold 1983) to estimate sexual selection on males as a function of their eight logcontrast CHCs (standardized; ∼N(0, 1)), along with the fixed effects of experimental block, order of oviposition environments, and their interaction. This yielded a column vector of standardized directional sexual selection gradients (b) representing the linear combination of CHCs that best explains variance in male mating success (i.e., male attractiveness; Blows 2007).
To generate additional traits representing different linear combinations of CHCs, we randomly reassigned mating success scores among males in the preference data from Delcourt et al. (2010). The multiple regression of a randomized set of male mating success scores against their eight standardized logcontrast CHC values yielded a vector of partial regression coefficients representing an arbitrary combination of CHCs. This approach preserved the phenotypic covariance structure inherent in the male CHCs, identifying linear combinations of CHCs that exist phenotypically within the population and that females could use in mate choice. We repeated this procedure 999 times, resulting in 1,000 different traits: the one particular linear combination of CHCs that best determines male mating success (b) and 999 other combinations. In all cases we used data only from the yeast environment (involving 3,315 chosen and rejected males), although preferences differed little when females were raised in the two environments (the vector correlation of the sexual selection
 gradients in yeast vs. corn was 98.2%; Delcourt et al. 2010), and our results were qualitatively unchanged if we used females raised in corn or we if pooled those from both environments (H. Rundle, unpublished data). All trait vectors were standardized to unit length before their use in further analyses, generating different traits that vary only in the relative contributions of the underlying CHCs (i.e., in their direction in multivariate trait space).
The strength of condition dependence of a trait was estimated by scoring males from the display data for the trait vector in question. The mean of this trait was then calculated separately for males raised in corn and yeast, and the strength of condition dependence was estimated as the difference in mean trait values between the two environments (corn minus yeast; the directionality is given by the results of an absolute fitness assay; see the appendix), with greater absolute differences indicating stronger condition dependence. To determine whether the particular combination of CHCs that females prefer most (i.e., male attractiveness as determined by b) was unusually condition dependent, we calculated the proportion of traits for which the strength of condition dependence was equal to or greater than that observed for male attractiveness.
The strength of directional sexual selection on the same trait arising from female mate choice was calculated by scoring males from the preference data for the same trait vector. Linear sexual selection on this trait was then estimated using standard first-order multiple regression (Lande and Arnold 1983) in which the mating success of individual males (0 p rejected, 1 p chosen) was modeled as a function of their trait value. The trait was standardized (∼N(0, 1)) before this analysis, such that the resulting regression coefficient represents a standardized selection gradient (b) that quantifies the strength and direction of linear sexual selection on it.
Finally, to determine the significance of the relationship between the strength of condition dependence and the strength of sexual selection for these traits, we used a randomization procedure that accounted for the fact that the

 1,000 traits are not independent of one another because they represent different linear combinations of the same eight logcontrast CHCs. These CHCs define an eightdimensional phenotypic space that can have at most eight independent (i.e., orthogonal) trait vectors within it. No particular set of eight orthogonal traits is of interest over another, so we employed a randomization procedure to generate unique sets of eight orthogonal traits within the phenotypic space. For each set, the strengths of condition dependence and sexual selection were determined as described above, and the correlation coefficient between them was calculated. The procedure was repeated 1,000 times, and a one-sample t-test (two-tailed) was used to determine whether the average correlation coefficient differed from significantly from 0.
Results
Genetic Analysis of CHCs
The genetic (co)variance matrices of the eight male CHC logcontrasts are presented in tables 1 and 2 for the cornand yeast-raised males, respectively. With the exception of (Z)-9-C25:1, which was weakly correlated with the other CHCs, the remaining CHCs were strongly correlated with one another (genetic correlations ranged from 0.88 to 0.99 in yeast and from 0.83 to 0.97 in corn), suggesting that the same genes contribute to the majority of segregating variance among these traits. This is reflected in the principal components of the two G matrices (table 3) with the first eigenvector (gmax), representing the combination of CHCs for which there is the most genetic variance, accounting for the majority of the total genetic variance in both corn (92.0%) and yeast (93.9%). Nevertheless, despite severe constraints on the multivariate patterns of genetic variation generated by these covariances, evidence does exist for the presence of a number of independent genetic dimensions of CHC variation in both environments, with five and four genetic principal components of G being significant in corn and yeast, respectively (table 4).
The first eigenvector of the sire # environment covariance matrix describes the combination of CHCs for which sires vary the most in their response to these two environments (table 3)—or, in other words, the trait having the most genetic variance in condition dependence. This eigenvector was statistically supported (LRT, x2 p 56.19, df p 8, P ! .0001), demonstrating significant genetic variance in CHC condition dependence. No other eigenvectors were significant at this level (LRT of the second dimension, x2 p 2.9, df p 7, P p .892).

   Note: Also shown is the vector of standardized directional sexual selection gradients on the eight logcontrast cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in males (b). In all three cases the eigenvectors were calculated from a model with four or more dimensions at all levels to avoid potential biases that can result from the underfitting of the number of genetic principal components (Meyer and Kirkpatrick 2008).
a This vector represents the linear combination of male CHCs that females prefer most (equivalent to male attractiveness) and is standardized to unit length.
Phenotypic Analyses of Condition Dependence
The combination of CHCs that best determines mate attractiveness (i.e., b) was significantly more condition dependent than expected (P p .049), indicating that females discriminate among mates using an unusually conditiondependent blend of male pheromones (fig. 1). Among these various blends, the strength of condition dependence for a trait also tended to increase with the strength of sexual selection on it (fig. 1), generating a significant positive correlation between these variables (r p 0.482, P ! .001). The sign of this association is consistent with the quality of these two environments, as inferred from the absolute fitness assay (see the appendix): for combinations of CHCs under directional sexual selection favoring a higher trait value, males raised on the high-quality corn diet tended to have higher (i.e., more attractive) values than did males raised on the lower-quality yeast diet. Conversely, for combinations of CHCs under directional sexual selection for a lower value, males raised in corn tended to have smaller values than did males raised in yeast, again making the former males more attractive than the latter.
Discussion
Condition dependence may have important implications for fundamental evolutionary processes, including the evolution of mate preferences and resolution of the lek paradox (Pomiankowski and Møller 1995; Rowe and Houle 1996; Kirkpatrick and Barton 1997; Houle 1998; Kotiaho et al. 2001; Houle and Kondrashov 2002; Tomkins et al.

 2004), adaptation to novel environments and niche expansion (Proulx 1999, 2001, 2002; Lorch et al. 2003; Whitlock and Agrawal 2009), the purging of genetic load and the evolution of sex (Whitlock 2000; Agrawal 2001; Siller 2001; Whitlock and Agrawal 2009), and the evolution of sexual dimorphism and the resolution of intralocus sexual conflict (Bonduriansky 2007a, 2007b). Although the condition dependence of sexual traits has received substantial empirical attention, many past studies suffered from a number of issues, including having few or no controls against which to compare changes in sexual traits and a failure to consider its genetic basis (Cotton et al. 2004). In addition, few of these studies have taken a multivariate approach, despite the fact that mate preferences often target multiple traits simultaneously (Brooks and Endler 2001; Candolin 2003; Chenoweth and Blows 2006). Quantitative estimates of selection are also often lacking, restricting the insight that can be gained into condition dependence.
Here, working with a multivariate sexual display composed of contact pheromones (CHCs) for which we had direct estimates of sexual selection, we tested for condition dependence using an experimental design that provides insight at both the phenotypic and genetic levels. Our results revealed that female mate preferences target a combination of CHCs in males that is unusually condition dependent relative to other possible blends females could use. By comparing among CHCs, we avoided possible issues concerning the differential sensitivity to condition of different classes of traits (e.g., morphological, behavioral, and chemical) arising for reasons other than the process of genic capture. We also showed a positive association between the strengths of condition dependence and sexual selection, as predicted by theory, with variance in the
 strength of selection explaining ∼23% (r2) of the variance in condition dependence. Finally, we demonstrated significant genetic variance for CHC condition dependence.
Cotton et al. (2004) recommend that condition manipulations should be realistic relative to that experienced under natural conditions. In this regard, our experiment appears to be appropriate in that individuals from our stock population survive and reproduce on both diets and the difference in emergence time between the flies raised in the two environments (1–2 days on average; M. Delcourt, unpublished data) is well within the range of variation within a single environment due to density effects during normal culture maintenance. Nevertheless, the effect of these diets was unexpected in another way: although corn increased male fitness (see the appendix), it is also known to decrease female fitness (Rundle et al. 2006; Delcourt et al. 2010). Such sexually antagonistic fitness effects are not surprising, given that the majority of genetic variance for fitness segregating in this population appears to be sexually antagonistic in both environments (Delcourt et al. 2009). Such a negative intersex genetic correlation for fitness implies that at least one and likely both sexes are off their fitness peak in yeast, the environment to which they are adapted. Whether a sexually antagonistic effect of an environmental manipulation of condition is unusual remains to be determined, although a similar result has been found in ambush bugs (Punzalan et al. 2008) and in another population of Drosophila serrata (Gosden and Chenoweth 2011) and may be a general feature arising from intralocus sexual conflict over sex-specific diet optima in insects (Maklakov et al. 2008). In addition, the persistence of sexually antagonistic selection within populations (Cox and Calsbeek 2010) and the prevalence of negative intersex genetic correlations for fitness (Kruuk et

The correlation (r p 0.482) was significant, as tested via a randomization procedure (P ! .001; see “Material and Methods”). The large circle indicates the particular combination of CHCs that was most preferred by females (i.e., male attractiveness); this blend was significantly more condition dependent than would be expected by chance, as shown in the histogram on the right (P p .049).
 al. 2008; Poissant et al. 2010) suggest that such effects may be common.
As also noted by Cotton el al. (2004), genetic aspects of condition dependence have received limited attention. Demonstrating genetic variance in condition dependence, for example, is consistent with sexual display traits evolving heightened condition dependence in response to persistent sexual selection, although it is also possible that female preferences may evolve to target male traits that are already good indicators of condition for other reasons (Johnstone et al. 2009). The relative role of these two processes is an important topic for future research. In addition, experimental studies of condition dependence generally use environmental manipulations, whereas it is genetic differences in condition that are of primary interest. Inbreeding has been used in this respect (e.g., Sheridan and Pomiankowski 1997; van Oosterhout et al. 2003), although the effects of novel mutations have received little attention. Finally, the degree to which the genetic mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism and condition de-
 pendence are shared is also largely unexplored (but see Bonduriansky and Rowe 2005; Bonduriansky 2007a), despite the expectation that sexual dimorphism will often be condition dependent. Unfortunately, we did not quantify CHCs from daughters in our breeding design, preventing us from estimating intersexual genetic correlations for these traits in this population. This will also be an important avenue for future research.
The paradox of the lek describes the apparent contradiction that strong selection on a male sexual display that signals genetic quality should rapidly deplete genetic variance in it, thus preventing females from receiving any indirect benefit from preferring the trait (Kirkpatrick and Ryan 1991). In some sense this paradox was seemingly resolved by the empirical observation of unexpectedly high genetic variance in sexually selected traits (Pomiankowski and Møller 1995). Condition dependence was put forward as a mechanistic resolution to this (Andersson 1994; Pomiankowski and Møller 1995; Rowe and Houle 1996). The idea is that genetic variance in condition is captured

 by display traits and, because condition is a large mutational target, genetic variance in display traits may be maintained despite persistent directional selection (Rowe and Houle 1996; Houle 1998). Despite increasing evidence for the condition-dependent expression of sexual traits, the abundance of genetic variance in them has been questioned of late, with the results of several quantitative genetic studies and manipulative experiments suggesting that little of this variance lies in the multivariate direction of selection (Walsh and Blows 2009).
In our population of D. serrata, females seem to prefer a combination of CHCs in males that is particularly condition dependent. Is this condition dependence sufficient to maintain relatively high standing genetic variance in this trait? Insight can be gained by projecting the vector of sexual selection due to female mate preferences (i.e., b) through the space defined by the genetic covariance matrix G, as given in equation (9) of Blows and Walsh (2009). Focusing on the population’s standard yeast laboratory environment, of the total genetic variance in male CHCs only 4.5% of it lines along b, suggesting that despite condition dependence relatively little genetic variance is maintained in this sexual display. Consequently, gmax (the first eigenvector of G), which accounts for 93.9% of the total genetic variance in CHCs, is oriented 78.3􏱟 away from b (see eq. [6] of Blows and Walsh 2009). This mirrors previous results from two different populations of D. serrata, one laboratory adapted and one from the field (Blows et al. 2004; Hine et al. 2004), and therefore appears to be a general result in this species. Similar results have also been found in the related species Drosophila bunndanda via both a quantitative genetic study (Van Homrigh et al. 2007) and a selection experiment (McGuigan et al. 2008), and observational and manipulative evidence exists for at least two other species (Hall et al. 2004; Hunt et al. 2007). Low standing genetic variance in multivariate traits under persistent directional selection may therefore be more common than previously appreciated (Walsh and Blows 2009).
The condition dependence of sexual traits is important to theories of the evolution and maintenance of costly female mate preferences via indirect benefits (i.e., good genes). Its apparent inability to maintain high standing genetic variance in male sexual displays in D. serrata suggests that selection may be sufficiently strong to rapidly remove deleterious mutations as they arise. If CHCs are a sensitive indicator of genetic quality that permit females to avoid mating with males carrying new, deleterious mutations, then females may benefit from their choice despite the presence of little standing genetic variance in the male display (Whitlock 2000; Tomkins et al. 2004; McGuigan and Blows 2009). Such a scenario suggests that the genetic relationship between condition and display traits may be more complex than originally suggested (e.g., McGuigan
 and Blows 2009). It also suggests that further insight into the good-genes hypothesis may require tests of the ability of females to avoid mating with males carrying deleterious mutations (Radwan 2004; Tomkins et al. 2004; McGuigan and Blows 2009). Such tests are an important goal of future work. Also key will be determining the extent to which environmental manipulations of condition (as used here) mirror the effects of genetic variance and thereby provide insight into the process of genic capture.

APPENDIX
Diet Manipulation and Male Condition
The standard approach in experimental studies of condition dependence involves manipulating environmental quality to generate individuals of differing condition, often via lowversus high-quality diets (Cotton et al. 2004). Our experiment took advantage of a breeding design that was conducted across two different larval food environments consisting of yeastversus corn flour–based media (the recipe for the novel medium is given in Rundle et al. 2005). Although these environments were chosen for unrelated reasons concerning the alignment of natural and sexual selection during adaptation (Rundle et al. 2006), they constitute larval diet manipulation. The effects of this manipulation on male condition are difficult to judge a priori because the foods are qualitatively different (as opposed to one being a dilution of the other). Therefore, to determine the effect of the diet manipulation on male condition, we conducted an assay to compare the absolute fitness of males raised in yeast versus corn. Comparing mean absolute fitness between diets is appropriate in this regard because condition is defined as the pool of metabolic resources an individual possesses, and it is the size of this pool and the efficiency with which individuals allocate it to competing life-history traits that determine

 their fitness. In other words, high condition confers higher absolute fitness, and an individual’s condition can be thought of as their potential fitness (Cotton et al. 2004; Bonduriansky and Rowe 2005).
The assay involved virgin males from the same stock raised in either yeast or corn that were placed singly in vials along with two virgin competitor males of similar age that were randomly chosen from a stock population into which a recessive orange-eye mutation had been introgressed. A single virgin orange-eyed female was added to each of these vials for 72 h, after which all flies were discarded and the vial was retained for offspring development. All vials contained yeast food and all competitor males and females were raised in the yeast environment, such that differences among treatments could be attributed solely to the environment (i.e., diet) in which the target male was raised. In total, 120 and 124 replicate vials were set up using males raised in the yeast and corn environments, respectively. Male absolute fitness was calculated as the number of offspring (i.e., non-orange-eyed flies) produced by the female. This measure of male fitness includes his reproductive success (preand postcopulatory), the subsequent productivity of the female with which he mated, and the survival to emergence of his offspring when in competition with half-sibling offspring sired by the orange-eyed competitors.
Males raised in corn produced 14.4 􏱠 1.65 (mean 􏱠 SE) adult offspring, compared with 10.0 􏱠 1.7 for males raised in yeast. This difference is significant (nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test, normal approximation, z p 􏱛2.87, n1 p 120, n2 p 124, P p .004), indicating higher absolute fitness—and hence condition—of males raised in corn than in those raised in yeast. The proportion of males that sired at least one offspring was significantly higher in corn-raised than in yeast-raised males (62% vs. 45%; Fisher’s exact test, P p .010), suggesting that the higher fitness of the corn-raised males arose at least in part from a higher mating success of these males. Of the males that sired at least one offspring (i.e., that successfully mated), corn-raised males also tended to produce more offspring, on average, than yeast-raised males (23.3 􏱠 1.9 vs. 22.2 􏱠 3.0 [mean 􏱠 SE]), although this difference was not significant (t-test on ln-transformed counts, tp􏱛1.44, dfp129, Pp.154).
