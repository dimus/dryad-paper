Abstract
In this study, we characterize and compare the genetic structure of aboveground and belowground populations of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria amethystina in an unmanaged mixed beech forest. Fruiting bodies and mycorrhizas of L. amethystina were mapped and collected in four plots in the S ́wie ̨tokrzyskie Mountains (Poland). A total of 563 fruiting bodies and 394 mycorrhizas were successfully genotyped using the rDNA IGS1 (intergenic spacer) and seven simple sequence repeat markers. We identified two different genetic clusters of L. amethystina in all of the plots, suggesting that a process of sympatric isolation may be occurring at a local scale. The proportion of individuals belonging to each cluster was similar among plots aboveground while it significantly differed belowground. Predominance of a given cluster could be explained by distinct host preferences or by priority effects and competition among genets. Both aboveground and belowground populations consisted of many intermingling small genets. Consequently, host trees were simultaneously colonized by many L. amethystina genets that may show different ecophysiological abilities. Our data showed that several genets may last for at least 1 year belowground and sustain into the next season. Ectomycorrhizal species reproducing by means of spores can form highly diverse and persistent belowground genets that may provide the host tree with higher resilience in a changing environment and enhance ecosystem performance.

Introduction
Soil microbes drive major biogeochemical processes and contribute to the maintenance of plant productivity and species richness in most terrestrial ecosystems (van der Heijden et al. 2008). Among these, ectomycorrhizal fungi are particularly important because they live in symbiotic association with the roots of trees and may

play a key role in the adaptation of forests to changing environmental conditions. They promote water and nutrient uptake in plants and protect them against soil borne pathogens (Read & Perez-Moreno 2003; Smith & Read 2008). Stress tolerance in host plants is, at least in some cases, mediated by the habitat-specific adaptations of fungal symbionts (Rodriguez & Redman 2008). Thus, understanding the dynamics of ectomycorrhizal soil populations can help us understand how forests function, evolve and respond to environmental changes. However, despite the key ecological role of ectomycorrhizal fungi, little is known about the population biology of most species (Douhan et al. 2011).

Because of the difficulties associated with the study of the vegetative phases of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis (mycorrhizas and extramatrical mycelium), most of the existing work on ectomycorrhizal populations has been based on the characterization of fruiting bodies growing aboveground (Amend et al. 2009). However, belowground genets represent the vegetative phase of the symbiosis and directly contribute to the local soil processes (Douhan et al. 2011). Occurrence of fruiting bodies is heterogeneous and affected by many environmental factors (Selosse et al. 1999; Kretzer et al. 2004). Moreover, fruiting bodies may not reflect the size, frequency or spatial extension of the genets belowground (Gherbi et al. 1999; Bergemann & Miller 2002). Thus, even if sampling and morphological identification of mycorrhizas may be challenging, the study of the different stages altogether is necessary to elucidate the population ecology of ectomycorrhizal fungi.
Existing results concerning belowground populations have often shown a good correspondence between the number and spatial distribution of genets found as fruiting bodies and as ectomycorrhizal roots, that is, with Hebeloma cylindrosporum (Guidot et al. 2001), Suillus grevillei (Zhou et al. 2001), Suillus pictus (Hirose et al. 2004) and Tricholoma matsutake (Lian et al. 2006). Several studies have reported moderate belowground genetic diversity and the presence of relatively large genets (e.g. Rubini et al. 2011, Tuber melanosporum) that can even link multiple trees (Lian et al. 2006; T. matsutake; Beiler et al. 2010, Rhizopogon spp.). This pattern corresponds to fungi in which vegetative growth of subterranean mycelium plays a more important role in propagation than colonization from wind-borne spores. However, many other ectomycorrhizal species propagate by sexual reproduction.
To better understand the mechanisms driving the population dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungi, we need more fine-scale studies focusing on species that reproduce mainly by sexual spores. The aboveground populations for these species are known to be highly diverse and constituted by small genets (e.g. Laccaria amethystina, Gherbi et al. 1999 and Fiore-Donno & Martin 2001; Hebeloma cylindrosporum, Gryta et al. 1997; Cantharellus formosus, Dunham et al. 2003 or Tricholoma scalpturatum, Carriconde et al. 2008). This strategy has been typically associated with young forests (Dahlberg & Stenlid 1994), but several examples have also shown the existence of small genets in mature forests (e.g. Fiore-Donno & Martin 2001; Redecker et al. 2001). Micro-disturbances that re-open the possibility of spore settlement may allow their existence in these old forests (Douhan et al. 2011). By looking at the belowground populations of these species, we could discern whether high intra-
specific variability is also characteristic of the vegetative phases of the symbiosis.
Intraspecific variability is important because biodiversity is an essential factor driving ecosystem functioning (Loreau et al. 2001) and genetic variation within species seems to be related to species diversity in a community (Vellend & Geber 2005). In particular, the genetic dissimilarity within a species promotes community performance by enhancing complementarity resource use (Jousset et al. 2011). The complementarity between individuals leads to better global resource exploitation and community performance (Loreau & Hector 2001). Moreover, populations with a higher intraspecific variation can be more resistant and resilient to environmental changes (Hughes & Stachowicz 2004; Reusch et al. 2005). To elucidate whether vegetative ectomycorrhizal populations can host high intraspecific variability, we have investigated the population genetics of the basidiomycete Laccaria amethystina (Huds.) Cooke. This species is common in boreal and temperate Eurasian forests, and its aboveground populations are constituted by numerous small genets (>7200 per ha) (Gherbi et al. 1999; Fiore-Donno & Martin 2001).
In this work, we analyse and compare the genetic structure of populations of the ectomycorrhizal fungus L. amethystina both abovegound and belowground in a mature Fagus sylvatica L. (beech) forest. The study has been conducted on a local scale and thus contributes to improving our view on the distribution of genets in the soil on a very fine scale, which is still limited (Douhan et al. 2011). To our knowledge, this is the first study surveying the belowground population structure of L. amethystina, a species disseminated mostly by windborne spores. We address the following questions: Which is the degree of intraspecific genetic variability in L. amethystina belowground populations? Is there any congruence in genetic structure and spatial distribution of individuals between aboveground and belowground populations? Are the L. amethystina individuals genetically differentiated either between or within plots? Do the populations show any fine-scale spatial structure? We discuss the ecological factors that could explain the observed population structure and the possible consequences for the ecosystem under study.

Study sites and sampling plots
This study was conducted in the S ́wie ̨tokrzyskie Mountains, central-eastern Poland, in one of the Intensive Study Sites of the Evoltree Network of Excellence (http://www.evoltree.eu). These mountains are among the oldest in Europe and are covered with mature

temperate forests, mostly issuing from natural regeneration after a large fire in 1834. The mean annual precipitation in this area is around 700 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7.4 °C. The vegetative season lasts 150–180 days with a mean temperature of 14.2 °C (Forest Inspectorate in Sucednio ́w 2010). The area is mostly protected (S ́ wie ̨ tokrzyski National Park) with some stands subjected to sustainable forest management. The variability of soils and moisture regimes of the mountains allows for high plant diversity. The most abundant tree species are Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and European silver fir (Abies alba). Many other tree species like beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver birch (Betula pendula), alder (Alnus spp.), Norway spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus spp.) or hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) are also present (Forest Inspectorate in Sucednio ́w 2010).
Two sites corresponding to beech forests mixed with European silver fir were selected within this area, one in the forest district of S ́ winia Go ́ ra (51°3¢ N, 20°43¢ E, 360 m a.s.l.) and the other in the Forest Reserve of Dalejo ́w (51°4¢ N, 20°44¢ E, 340 m a.s.l.). The area of each site is approximately 2.2 ha, and the distance between sites is 2.7 km. In Dalejo ́w, two age cohorts of mature trees can be distinguished (i.e. trees older than 200 years and trees younger than 100 years) while S ́winia Go ́ra is characterized by a more uniform age structure (Forest Inspectorate in Sucednio ́w 2010). Two plots where fruiting bodies of L. amethystina were present were selected in each site. Each plot was delimited by a longitudinal transect and located according to its position relative to the present mature trees. The two plots were located 10 m apart from each other in the S ́winia Go ́ra site and 50 m apart from each other in the Dalejo ́w site. Plot 1 in S ́winia Go ́ra was 19 · 7 m, plot 2 in S ́winia Go ́ra was 5 · 10 m, plot 1 in Dalejo ́w was 20·12m and plot 2 in Dalejo ́w was 16·15m. The area of the delimited plots depended on the distribution of the fruiting bodies of L. amethystina. In the Dalejo ́w site, the fruiting bodies were more dispersed and, consequently, larger plots were selected to have a similar number of fruiting bodies per plot.
Survey of fruiting bodies
We initiated sampling in October 2008, when fruiting bodies of L. amethystina were mapped and collected in plot 1 of the S ́winia Go ́ra site. In 2009, plots were visited during late summer and autumn until fructification of L. amethystina was observed. Mapping and sampling was conducted in September 2009 in plot 1 of the S ́winia Go ́ra site and in October 2009 in all four plots from the two study sites. All L. amethystina fruiting bodies present in each plot were numbered and mapped according to their relative position (x, y) to a longitudi-
nal transect and collected in single envelopes. Mapping error, if any, was low (10 cm maximum) and should not alter spatial genetic structure estimates. Samples were dried using an air dryer and kept in a dry place until DNA extraction. A total of 589 L. amethystina fruiting bodies were collected in the four study plots.
Sampling of mycorrhizas
Laccaria amethystina mycorrhizas were collected from fine beech roots present in soil cores of 5 cm diameter and 6 cm height regularly sampled from the four study plots in October 2009. Three parallel longitudinal transects 1 m apart from each other were marked out in the central part of each plot (five in plot 2 of S ́winia Go ́ra because of its reduced length). Soil core samples were collected every 2 m along each transect, taking up to the first 10 cm of depth, except in plot 2 in S ́winia Go ́ra where cores were collected every 1 m to obtain a similar number of soil samples per plot. According to the size of the plots, a total of 33 samples were collected in plot 1 in S ́winia Go ́ra, 30 in plot 2 of the same site and 39 in plot 1 in Dalejo ́w. No regular sampling was conducted in plot 2 in Dalejo ́w. Two 2 · 2 m subplots were selected in each plot (only one in plot 2 in S ́winia Go ́ra because of its reduced size) for a more focused root sampling. The subplots were established in areas where abundant fruiting bodies were observed aboveground to sample directly underneath the fruiting bodies. Soil samples were collected every 25 cm using a soil core of 1.5 cm diameter and 6 cm height (81 collected soil cores per subplot). See Fig. 1 for a representation of regular and focused root sampling areas in the four plots.
Soil samples were kept in the freezer until further examination. Roots were washed under tap water, and putative mycorrhizas of L. amethystina were collected under a stereomicroscope. Morphological identification of mycorrhizas was performed according to Agerer (1987–2003). The mycorrhizas were characterized by a light beige or pinkish to light brown colour of the mantle with a characteristic amethystine colour at the top (on young mycorrhizas). The mantle was slightly to extremely woolly with whitish or slightly beige extramatrical hyphae. The type of dichotomy of the mycorrhizas was single, irregular or forming tails covered with a dense coat of extramatrical hyphae. Mycorrhizas were stored at )20 °C in distilled water until DNA extraction. A total of 542 putative L. amethystina mycorrhizas were collected in the four plots.

a single mycorrhizal root tip. Samples were disrupted in a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) with two 3-mm tungsten-carbide beads per sample and three 1-min-high-speed (30 Hz) shaking steps. DNA was extracted in a BioSprint 96 workstation (Qiagen) with the BioSprint 96 DNA Plant Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions but using AP1 buffer

Genotyping of fruiting bodies and mycorrhizas was performed by amplifying the intergenic spacer 1 (IGS1) of the rDNA (using the primers developed by Roy et al. 2008) and seven microsatellite loci: La115 (Roy et al. 2008), P02, P08 and P35 (Donges et al. 2008), La03

(Wadud et al. 2006), 1195M13 and Lv257 (Vincenot et al. 2012). PCR amplifications were performed in 10lL reaction volumes containing ultrapure H2O, 1· incubation buffer (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France), 0.6 mg ⁄ mL BSA, 2 mM dNTPs, 1 U Taq polymerase (MP Biomedicals) and approximately 10 ng of template DNA. Concentrations of primers were 0.1 lM for P02, P08 and P35 loci and 0.2 lM for the others. Lv257, La03, La115, 1195M13 and P02 markers were amplified under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C (Lv257), 58 °C (La03), 60 °C (La115, 1195M13) or 62 °C (P02) for 1 min (30 s for P02) and extension at 72 °C for 1 min (30 s for P02), with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The loci IGS1, P08 and P35 were amplified by touchdown PCR with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min and 16 cycles that followed denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C ()1 °C⁄2 cycles) for 45 s and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The next 25 cycles followed denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 52 °C for 45 s and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. PCRs were ended with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.
Forward primers were labelled using fluorescent WellRED dyes (Beckman Coulter Inc, Villepinte, France). PCR products were pooled after amplification according to the size of the fragments in the following combinations: IGS-P08, La03-1195M13-P02 and La115Lv257-P35. Detection of the labelled PCR products was carried out in a genetic analyzer (CEQ8000, Beckman Coulter). We used the DNA Size Standard Kit – 600 and the Frag-4 separation method following the GenomeLabTM Fragment analysis protocol provided by the manufacturer (http://www.beckmancoulter.com). Fragment sizes were manually checked. To assess the reproducibility of the analysis, about 10% of the samples were genotyped twice.
Data analyses
The fruiting bodies or mycorrhizas having the same pattern of alleles in all studied loci (identical multilocus genotype) were considered to form a single genet (or genetic individual) assuming no genotyping errors. Identification of genets was performed by using the ‘Find clones’ option from the GenAlEx 6.2 software (Peakall & Smouse 2006). A corrected dataset with one sample per genet was created for each plot. All further analyses were conducted using this clone-corrected dataset. The probability of identity (probability that two unrelated individuals have the same multilocus genotype by chance, Waits et al. 2001) was calculated for each set of data using GenAlEx. Standard descriptive statistics for each plot were also computed using Gen-
AlEx, including allelic frequencies, observed (HO) and expected heterozygosity (HE), inbreeding coefficient (FIS) and deviation of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium among pairs of loci was estimated by using the log likelihood ratio statistic from the online version of the Genepop software (http:// genepop.curtin.edu.au/). The different datasets were compared using the locus by locus AMOVA option in the Arlequin 3.1 software (Excoffier et al. 2005) with 1000 permutations. We used STRUCTURE 2.2 software (Pritchard et al. 2000) to infer the presence of distinct subpopulations (with limited gene flow) and assign the individuals to these subpopulations. Parameters were set to an admixture model, allele frequencies correlated among populations and both length of burn-in period and number of MCMC Reps after burn-in of 10 000. The most likely number of clusters (K) was estimated by following the procedure described by Evanno et al. (2005). Because the Delta method by Evanno et al. (2005) does not allow testing K = 1 hypothesis, we performed a PCA analysis based on the genetic distance matrix as a check for K = 2 result (GenAlEx). Correlation between matrices of geographic distance and individual-by-individual genetic distance was analysed by a Mantel test in GenAlEx. Finally, SPAGeDi 1.3 software (Hardy & Vekemans 2002) was used for a fine-scale spatial analysis of the datasets in each plot using the kinship coefficient estimated according to J. Nason (described in Loiselle et al. 1995) and 10 distance classes.
Results
Aboveground genetic structure
A total of 563 of 589 fruiting bodies of L. amethystina from all plots and sampling times were successfully genotyped using the rDNA IGS1 and the seven polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers. Among the genotyped fruiting bodies, 332 different multilocus genotypes (genets) were identified. Results on the number of detected genets, genotypic diversity index, maximum number of fruiting bodies forming a single genet and mean size of genets for the four plots at the different sampling times are shown in Table 1. The mean probability of identity was 1.2 · 10)4, thus the probability that two samples have the same multilocus genotype by chance is very low and in the same range of other fungal population studies (Kretzer et al. 2004; Bergemann et al. 2006; Lian et al. 2006; Donges et al. 2008). The mean number of alleles per locus was 3.94 and ranged from 2 to 8. The observed heterozygosity (0.322) was much lower than expected for a panmictic population (0.484), resulting in a mean FIS value of 0.276. The loci

with positive FIS values were P02, P08, P35 and 1195M13. Donges et al. (2008) already reported lower observed heterozygosity than the expected for P02, P08 and P35 markers. Only the loci IGS, La03, La115 and Lv257 were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Significant linkage disequilibrium was found in 15 of 28 (54%) pairs of loci. The mean number of collected fruiting bodies in the two plots sampled from the S ́ winia Go ́ ra site was 131 per 100 m2, and the mean number of different detected genets was 81 per 100 m2. In Dalejo ́w, the mean number of L. amethystina collected fruiting bodies and detected genets were 32 and 15 per 100 m2, respectively.
The spatial distribution of the fruiting bodies and genets sampled in October 2009 in each of the four studied plots is represented in Fig. 1. Fifteen genets detected in plot 1 in the S ́ winia Go ́ ra site in October 2008 (21% of the total) were sampled again in September or October 2009. Five other genets (11%) were re-sampled within the same fruiting season (between September and October 2009). The re-sampled genets were located approximately at the same plot coordinates except for two of them (separated by 3 and 17 m, respectively).
Belowground genetic structure
A total of 394 of 542 putative L. amethystina mycorrhizas collected in the four study plots were successfully genotyped, 138 of them were collected in the regular sampling of the plots and the others in the focused sampling of the subplots. Sampling areas for each of the four plots are represented in Fig. 1. Among the 394
genotyped mycorrhizas, 265 different genets were identified. Results on the number of detected genets, genotypic diversity index, maximum number of sampled mycorrhizas forming a single genet and average size of genets for the ectomycorrhizas collected in the four plots in October 2009 are shown in Table 1. Mycorrhizas were found in 12 of the 33 sampled soil cores in the regular sampling of plot 1 in the S ́winia Go ́ra site, in 14 of30inplot2inS ́winiaGo ́raandintwoof39inplot1 of the Dalejo ́w site. In the subplots, the number of soil cores containing L. amethystina mycorrhizas ranged from 4 (in plot 2 Dalejo ́ w) to 26 (in plot 1 S ́ winia Go ́ ra) out of the 81 cores collected in each subplot. The mean probability of identity was 3.7 · 10)4. The mean number of alleles per locus was 3.75 and ranged from 2 to 8. The expected and observed heterozygosity were 0.440 and 0.346, respectively, and the mean FIS value was 0.129. Results on the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium were equivalent to those obtained for the fruiting bodies. Twenty-five of 28 (89%) pairs of loci showed significant linkage disequilibrium.
A total of nine genets were found both as fruiting bodies and as mycorrhizas. In all cases, both the fruiting bodies and the corresponding mycorrhizas were located in the same position in the plot. Five of these genets were found above and belowground at the same sampling time. The other four were found as mycorrhizas in October 2009 and as a fruiting body in one of the previous samplings (October 2008 or September 2009). We detected different L. amethystina genets coexisting in a single root. We collected 83 root fragments that had multiple L. amethystina mycorrhizas. In 67 of the 83 root samples, the mycorrhizas present in a single root

fragment belonged to two or more different genets. The number of mycorrhizas collected in the Dalejo ́w site was very low and consequently the two plots corresponding to this site were excluded from further comparison analyses.
Genetic differentiation
Genetic differentiation between fruiting bodies sampled in the four study plots (two in S ́winia Go ́ra and two in Dalejo ́w) in October 2009 was analysed by AMOVA. Less than 5% of the total genetic variability was explained by differences between plots or sites (Table 2) while the highest variability was found within each plot. Fruiting bodies collected during the three sampling times (October 2008, September and October 2009) in plot 1 of the S ́ winia Go ́ ra site were also compared. Again we found that only 5% of the variability was explained by differences between sampling times (data not shown). When comparing the two plots in S ́ winia Go ́ ra at the mycorrhiza level, the genetic differentiation was higher, with 16% of the variability explained by differences between plots (Table 2).
We used a Bayesian approach to delineate clusters of individuals on the basis of their multilocus genotypes by using the STRUCTURE software (Pritchard et al. 2000). Using the delta-K procedure proposed by Evanno et al. (2005), K = 2 clusters of individuals were identified. Results were the same when running the InStruct software (Gao et al. 2007), which does not assume Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium. Individuals belonging to the two clusters were spatially separated in a PCA analysis
Table 2 Results for AMOVA analyses (average over eight loci) on fruiting bodies (n = 218) and mycorrhizas (n = 211) of L. amethystina collected in October 2009 (corrected datasets). The upper part of the table corresponds to the comparisons between plots (four plots for fruiting bodies and two— corresponding to the S ́ winia Go ́ ra site—for mycorrhizas). The lower part corresponds to the comparisons between genetic clusters defined by STRUCTURE software with all the data together
(percentage of variation explained by axis 1 = 26.62%, axis 2 = 19.95%) allowing for a validation of K = 2 result (Fig. S1, Supporting information). We evaluated the degree of admixture (interbreeding) between the two genetic clusters by calculating the proportion of individuals with a probability of belonging to one of the groups lower than 0.7 (arbitrary threshold). The proportion of admixed individuals using this threshold was about 7% for the fruiting bodies and 16% for the mycorrhizas. The proportion of individuals belonging to each cluster was compared using a Z-test and was not significantly different between plots or sampling times aboveground, although it was belowground (Fig. 2). On average, 65% of the individuals in a plot belonged to the same cluster. The cluster with a higher proportion of individuals was cluster 1 in all plots except plot 2 from S ́ winia Go ́ ra. This plot showed a higher number of individuals belonging to cluster 2, and the difference among plots was only significant (P < 0.05) when analysing mycorrhizas (Fig. 2). We analysed the distribution of the clusters in the plots and we found that fruiting bodies belonging to the two clusters were regularly distributed through the study plots (Fig. 3).
We analysed the genetic differentiation among individuals belonging to the two genetic clusters. AMOVA results showed that 20% of the genetic variation is explained by differences between clusters (Table 2). Differences were explained by changes in the allele frequencies at four loci (P02, P08, P35 and 1195M13). When analysing the data on the two genetic clusters separately, linkage disequilibrium was found in 21 of 28 (75%) pairs of loci and only four loci (IGS, La03, La115, Lv257) were on Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.
Spatial genetic structure
A Mantel test showed no significant correlation between geographic and genetic distances in any of the plots, with correlation coefficients close to 0 (data not shown). Neither was a correlation found when separating the data by genetic clusters. On the other hand, using SPAGeDi, a positive correlation between the kinship coefficient and the distance was found in the first 2 m between fruiting bodies in plot 1 from S ́ winia Go ́ ra and plot 1 from Dalejo ́w (Fig. 4). Individuals growing <2 m apart were genetically more related than random individuals. Results on the other two plots showed the same trend but were less evident because of the higher standard errors (Fig. 4). When including all of the samples in the analyses (not correcting for clones), the results were equivalent but with higher kinship coefficients (data not shown). When separating data in each plot by the two genetic clusters, we obtained similar

Discussion
Coexistence of two different genetic clusters
One main interesting finding of this study is the identification of two different genetic clusters of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete L. amethystina coexisting in all of the plots. Admixed individuals are found in quite a low number, and 20% of the total genetic vari-
ation is explained by differences between these two clusters. This may suggest the existence of two isolated co-occurring groups. No clear species delineation is available for some fungi like Laccaria spp. (Douhan et al. 2011), and there is considerable evidence for cryptic species and⁄or ecological adaptations in natural fungal populations (Burnett 2003, Giraud et al. 2008). Low transferability of markers (Donges et al. 2008) and genetic differentiation (Vincenot et al. 2012) among Japanese and European L. amethystina populations suggest that two cryptic species may exist between the two continents. In our case, the two identified groups may correspond to two distinct ecotypes occurring sympatrically.

While sympatric speciation in pathogens often responds to host specialization, there is no unique evolutionary base for speciation in ectomycorrhizal fungi (reviewed in Douhan et al. 2011). Factors like host specificity, type of soil or vegetation type have been hypothesized as drivers of speciation in the species Tricholoma cingulatum and T. argyraceum (Jargeat et al. 2010),
within Pisolithus albus (Jourand et al. 2010) or in Lactarius spp. (Geml et al. 2009). In the case of our study, the differentiation of two genetic clusters may be a response to different microhabitats, host age or host genotype. Multigene genealogy studies should be conducted to elucidate whether L. amethystina could hide a phenomenon of sympatric speciation at a local scale.

This methodology has been proposed by Taylor et al. (2000) to delineate phylogenetic species within fungi and has been already used by several authors (e.g. Geml et al. 2006 for Amanita muscaria, Hedh et al. 2008 for Paxillus involutus complex or Jargeat et al. 2010 for T. scalpturatum complex).
Priority effects (Kennedy et al. 2009) and competition for root colonization between genets belonging to the two clusters may explain the differences in their proportions among plots and the dominance of a given cluster at a local scale. As this species reproduces sexually, early colonists arriving by spores may negatively affect the performance of later arrivals and outcompete them, as shown by Kennedy et al. (2009) for three Rhizopogon species. Besides numerous examples of interspecific competition (Kennedy 2010), Rubini et al. (2011) also detected competition between individuals belonging to two mating types in T. melanosporum. Another process that may be promoting the predominance of a given cluster in a plot could be the preference of host trees with different genotypes or ages for different L. amethystina genetic clusters. This species has been defined as a multihost symbiont, and no evidence of host specialization has been found in French populations (Roy et al. 2008). However, the presence of one adult beech tree in plot 2 in S ́ winia Go ́ ra while no adults were found in plot 1 would support the hypothesis of host age specialization. In this sense, forest age ⁄ management has been shown to affect the spatial genetic structure of populations of T. matsutake (Amend et al. 2009) or Frankia, a bacterial symbiont of plants (Kennedy et al. 2010).
In any case, the dominance of a given cluster by any of the above-mentioned processes at a local scale will be enhanced by the limited dispersion of the spores. Our results on fine-scale spatial analysis indicate that, even if gene flow between plots and sites was possible, individuals located <2 m apart were
genetically more similar than the ones located further away. Similar fine-scale genetic structure has been observed for other fungi like Cantharellus formosus (Dunham et al. 2006), Tricholoma scalpturatum (Carriconde et al. 2008) or T. matsutake (Amend et al. 2009). On the contrary, Mantel tests showed no correlation between genetic and geographic distances. Lack of concordance in results between the two methods may be related to the fact that Mantel test tests for global correlation and therefore may be not sensitive enough to detect correlation within selected distance ranges (Peakall et al. 2003).
Belowground genetic structure
Our study is the first to describe the population structure of the L. amethystina genets that are actively colonizing roots. Belowground genets were highly diverse, intermingling and often restricted to a single mycorrhizal root tip with a maximum genet size of 1 m. Vegetative small genets have also been found for the ericoid fungus Meliniomyces variabilis (0.13 m, Grelet et al. 2010) or R. vinicolor (2 m, Kretzer et al. 2004). However, Beiler et al. (2010) found larger genets for the latter species (12.1 m). Other species like Xerocomus chrysenteron, Suillus pictus or Rhizopogon vesiculosus also form much larger genets (>110 m, Fiore-Donno & Martin 2001; 25– 30 m, Hirose et al. 2004; 20.1 m, Beiler et al. 2010; respectively). In some cases, a single fungal genet can colonize several trees at the same time (T. matsutake, Lian et al. 2006; Rhizopogon spp., Beiler et al. 2010). In our case, the existence of connections between trees through the fungal hyphae seems improbable because of the small size of the genets belowground, but it remains possible as roots intermingle. In this sense, Grelet et al. (2010) found small genets of M. variabilis colonizing simultaneously Pinus sylvestris and Vaccinium spp. roots.

Interestingly, we found different L. amethystina genets colonizing one single root at the same time. This indicates that host trees are simultaneously colonized by many different genets that may have different ecophysiological abilities. This represents a very contrasting pattern to the one observed for other ectomycorrhizal species like T. matsutake (Lian et al. 2006), R. vesiculosus, R. vinicolor (Beiler et al. 2010) or Tuber melanosporum (Rubini et al. 2011), where only a few genets have been found colonizing each tree. Differences in physiology or colonization ability among strains within a species have already been reported in ectomycorrhizal (Ho 1987; Molina & Trappe 1994; Sawyer et al. 2003; Guidot et al. 2005; Hedh et al. 2008; Parlade ́ et al. 2011), arbuscular (Munkvold et al. 2004; Koch et al. 2006) and ericoid fungi (Grelet et al. 2009). In the case of our study, close genets that may be colonizing the same host are genetically more similar than genets located far away and they preferentially belong to the same genetic cluster. They could thus show similar ecophysiological abilities.
Further research based on genome resequencing will facilitate the characterization of differences in gene repertoires among genets or clusters and will provide a better understanding of their functional differences and the ecological meaning of their coexistence. Complementarity among distinct genotypes because of niche differentiation or facilitation would promote community performance and alter ecosystem functioning (Loreau & Hector 2001; Jousset et al. 2011). For example, genotypic diversity in the seagrass Zostera marina enhanced community resistance to disturbance (Hughes & Stachowicz 2004). Reusch et al. (2005) also showed that genotypic diversity in this species enhanced biomass production, plant density and faunal abundance, despite extreme water temperatures because of warming across Europe. Similarly, populations containing several genotypes of the mycorrhizal fungus Paxillus obscurosporus had greater productivity and produced more CO2 than those with fewer genotypes (Wilkinson et al. 2010). The fungal intraspecific diversity may have important secondorder effects on host plant productivity and growth (Wilkinson et al. 2010) or stress tolerance (Rodriguez & Redman 2008).
Aboveground and belowground correspondence
We found a high genetic variability within plots both aboveground, as fruiting bodies, and belowground, as mycorrhizas, with populations formed by many small genets. We found spatial coincidence whenever a genet was sampled both as a fruiting body and as a mycorrhiza, supporting a restricted vegetative dispersal of the genets. However, only nine genets were found in both
forms (out of the 332 and 265 genets identified as fruiting bodies and mycorrhizas, respectively). This strongly contrasts with the high correspondence observed for the ectomycorrhizal fungus H. cylindrosporum (Guidot et al. 2001) but may be explained both by the small size of the genets and by the short lifespan of the fruiting bodies. These two factors make it very challenging to simultaneously sample the same genet from both its fruiting body and its mycorrhiza.
Our data support the hypothesis that small genets from L. amethystina are not necessarily ephemeral but that they may last longer belowground in vegetative form and present erratic fruiting. This has been already suggested for other Laccaria species that have shown intraspecific variation in fruiting phenology (Selosse et al. 2001). In our study, aboveground sampling of identical genets at different times was low (as also observed in Gherbi et al. 1999; Fiore-Donno & Martin 2001). However, we sampled some genets as mycorrhiza in October 2009 that we had already collected as fruiting bodies (i.e. they existed as mycorrhizas) in the previous samplings (September 2009 or October 2008). Thus, fruiting bodies may only provide a partial picture of the population, and this could explain why we only found significant differences in the proportions of clusters (and consequently higher differentiation by AMOVA) when analysing mycorrhizas. Given that diversity and activity of the ectomycorrhizal community in the soil may change with the season (Koide et al. 2007; Courty et al. 2010), sampling of roots was performed in autumn when we had already observed that L. amethystina mycorrhizas were present in the study area. The vegetative persistence of genets contrasts with the results reported for H. cylindrosporum (Guidot et al. 2001, 2003) and S. grevillei (Zhou et al. 2001) that show no persistence of the vegetative parts of the genets from 1 year to the next. Long-term studies should be conducted to evaluate how long the vegetative structures can persist in the soil.
Conclusions
This paper contributes to a better knowledge of the population ecology of ectomycorrhizal fungi providing new insights into the structure of soil populations colonizing roots. Given the results, we maintain that efforts should be made to overcome the technical difficulties associated with the study of mycorrhizas and increase the number of works on belowground populations. In summary, here we show that a high intraspecific genetic variability can be characteristic of the vegetative populations of ectomycorrhizal fungi in mature forests. We demonstrate that, consequently, host trees are simultaneously colonized by distinct L. amethystina

genets. This may provide the ecosystem with a higher resilience to environmental changes. We also show that these genets have a limited spatial propagation by vegetative spread and that, at least some of them, can persist from 1 year to the next one. Finally, we report the coexistence of two distinct genetic clusters of L. amethystina in all of the plots studied. We hypothesize that the predominance of a given cluster in a plot is promoted by the short range dispersal of the spores and that it may respond to different host preferences or to priority effects and competition among genets. This work opens new exciting questions to be addressed in the future, namely if local populations of L. amethystina may hide a phenomenon of sympatric speciation, how different the distinct genets and clusters that colonize a single tree are in terms of function or how long the vegetative structures of this fungus can persist in the soil.
