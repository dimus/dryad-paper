Abstract
DNA-based gut content analysis has become an important tool for unravelling feeding interactions in invertebrate communities under natural conditions. It usually implies killing of the consumer and extracting the DNA from its food, using either the whole animal or its dissected gut. This post-mortem approach, however, is not suitable for investigating the diet of rare or protected species and also prohibits tracking individual dietary preferences as each consumer can provide trophic information only once. Moreover, removing large numbers of consumers from a habitat for analysis might critically change population densities and affect species interactions. Here, we present DNA-based analysis of invertebrate regurgitates, a novel approach to overcome these limitations. Conducting feeding experiments where adult Poecilus cupreus (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were fed with larvae of Amphimallon solstitiale (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), we show that detection success in regurgitates compared to samples prepared from whole beetles was similar or significantly enhanced for small ⁄ medium and large prey DNA fragments, respectively. Prey DNA detection success remained high in regurgitates stored in ethanol for 21 months at room temperature prior to DNA extraction. We conclude that in those invertebrates where regurgitates can be obtained, examination of food DNA in regurgitates offers many advantages over conventional post-mortem gut content analysis.

Introduction
Molecular methods have become a major tool to examine trophic interactions in terrestrial and aquatic communities under natural conditions, addressing the full range of feeding relationships from herbivory or predation to parasitism (Symondson 2002; Gariepy et al. 2007; King et al. 2008; Staudacher et al. 2011). In vertebrate consumers, faecal material usually gets analysed for DNA of food remains (e.g. Deagle et al. 2009; Oehm et al. 2011), entailing the advantage that the consumer does not need to be killed for trophic examination, whereas the gut content of a killed animal is only rarely used (Soininen et al. 2009). Contrastingly, in invertebrates, examination of the gut content for molecular remains of ingested animals and plants employs post-mortem approaches, where DNA extracts, either derived from the whole body of the consumer (e.g. Fournier et al. 2008; Lundgren et al. 2009) or from its dissected gut (e.g. Chacon et al. 2008; Garros et al. 2008; Hatteland et al. 2011), are used for dietary analysis. Post-mortem gut content analysis, however, has several disadvantages: (i) an individual consumer can

provide trophic information only once as it is killed before analysis, impeding the examination of individual dietary preferences in large invertebrates that can be individually labelled and recaptured, (ii) removing consumers in large numbers from a habitat might affect community composition with potential effects on food web interactions and (iii) post-mortem gut content analysis is impractical for dietary analysis in rare and protected species.
Here, we present the DNA-based examination of regurgitates, a novel noninvasive approach of gut content analysis for invertebrate consumers. This approach makes use of the fact that many invertebrates are able to cast up their gut content, often deliberately as a defence mechanism. Collecting these regurgitates and analysing them for food DNA allows deriving dietary information without the disadvantages inherent to post-mortem gut content analysis described above. Moreover, the preservation of regurgitates might be superior to the preservation and storage of whole animals as the latter usually need to be quickly frozen upon collection to minimize prey DNA breaking down after collection (King et al. 2008; Weber & Lundgren 2009). However, to our knowledge, no study has yet examined whether this approach

provides a feasible means to analyse invertebrate feeding interactions by comparing prey DNA detection success between conventional whole-body DNA extracts and regurgitates.
The present experiments were conducted using carabid beetles. Carabids are widespread and abundant in terrestrial habitats, and they span, as a group, different trophic levels (Thiele 1977; Kromp 1999). Many carabid species are known to produce regurgitates, often as a defence mechanism (Forsythe 1982; Sunderland et al. 2005), a behaviour that can be exploited to collect regurgitates for trophic analysis. We used Poecilus cupreus (Linnaeus) to conduct our experiments as this omnivorous species is abundant in arable fields throughout Europe and is considered as an important antagonist of insect pests (Luff 2002; Sunderland 2002).
The aims of our study were threefold: (i) to examine whether prey DNA can be detected in the beetles’ regurgitates, (ii) to compare prey DNA detection rates between whole-body DNA extracts and regurgitates over the course of digestion while targeting three different prey DNA fragment lengths and (iii) to examine whether long-term storage of regurgitate samples, prior to DNA extraction, affects prey detection success.
Materials and methods
Feeding experiments
Adult Poecilus cupreus were collected in organically cultivated fields near Innsbruck (Austria) and identified by us using the morphological characters described in the key of Freude et al. (2004) and by comparing them with reference beetles that have been barcoded previously (Juen & Traugott 2006; GenBank Accession nos DQ295309 – DQ295311). The beetles were kept in a temperature chamber at a constant 16 °C, experienced a light ⁄ dark cycle of 16:8 h and were maintained on freeze-killed mealworms (Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus; Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) until they were used in the feeding experiment. To ensure that no mealworm DNA was present in the beetles’ digestive tracts and to adjust the consumers to the same hunger level, all beetles were starved 1 week prior to the experiment.
In the gut content feeding experiment, starved carabids were fed with larvae of the summer chafer Amphimallon solstitiale Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), collected from grassland soils near Innsbruck. The grubs were identified by us using the morphological characters described in the key of Klausnitzer & Krell (1996). Additionally, the larvae were compared with voucher specimens from previously DNA-barcoded larvae (Juen & Traugott 2006; GenBank accession nos DQ295268.1 – DQ295273.1), to confirm their identity. Each grub was
frozen, and the head and the gut content were removed and sliced into four pieces before feeding carabids with one piece each. During the 2-h feeding phase, each P. cupreus was kept in a transparent 20-mL plastic tube. Tubes were equipped with a piece of moistened paper towels and covered with perforated plastic lids. To determine the meal size, the mass of each P. cupreus was determined to the nearest 0.01 mg before and after feeding. Only those beetles that showed a significant increase in initial mass (at least 25%), which is typical for generalist predators such as carabid beetles (Juen & Traugott 2005), were used for the experiment.
After feeding, the beetles were transferred to fresh tubes and kept without food in the temperature chamber. Batches of 10 carabids each were frozen in 1.5-mL reactiontubesat)28°Cat0,4,8,16,24,28and32hpostfeeding (at 0 h, beetles were frozen immediately after the determination of their biomass post-feeding).
In the regurgitation experiment, a separate set of beetles was fed and treated as described above, with the exception that the beetles were forced to regurgitate before freezing them. Regurgitation was activated by gently pressing the beetles’ anterior abdominal sternites. This treatment resulted in the carabids producing a droplet of regurgitate, which was soaked up by a cotton wool tip (Ombia Care, CMC GmbH, Du ̈ ren Germany). All beetles produced regurgitate in this experiment, and both the obtained regurgitate and its corresponding beetle were stored at )28 °C in separate 1.5-mL reaction tubes. To check for DNA carry-over contamination from handling the beetles, within each set of 10 predators, one control tip was taken by handling the cotton wool tip exactly as described above but without touching a beetle.
Long-term storage experiments
To examine whether long-term storage of regurgitates in ethanol affects prey DNA detection success, regurgitates from beetles that digested their meals for 8 and 16 h were collected on cotton wool tips as described above (17 beetles per time point). Immediately after the cotton wool tips were placed in 1.5-mL reaction tubes, 􏰁1 mL of 80% ethanol was added to each sample. These samples were stored in the dark at room temperature. The corresponding beetles were stored at )28 °C (‘long-term storage regurgitation experiment’). Additionally, whole beetles that also had digested A. solstitiale meals for 8 and 16 h were either kept at room temperature in 80% ethanol (‘long-term storage ethanol experiment’) or at )28 °C (‘long-term storage gut content feeding experiment’) (20 beetles for each time point and storage method). All samples designated to this experiment were stored for 21 months before they were subjected to DNA extraction and PCR.

DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole beetles and regurgitates using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-based protocol (Juen & Traugott 2005). One extraction negative control was added within every batch of 30 samples to test for DNA carry-over during the extraction process. All whole beetle DNA extracts were cleaned with a silica-based nucleic acid purification kit (Q-Biogene, Montreal, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, to remove PCR-inhibiting substances.
Screening predators for prey DNA
A set of four specific primers, designed from cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences of A. solstitiale (Juen & Traugott 2006), was used to test the carabid samples for the presence of prey DNA (Table S1). These primers, in different combinations, allowed amplifying small (127 bp; SPE-CO1-S21 and SPE-CO1-A14), medium (463 bp; SPE-CO1-S13 and SPE-CO1-A14) and large (853 bp; SPECO1-S13 and SPE-CO1-A15) COI fragments. Aside from extensive specificity tests carried out earlier (Juen & Traugott 2006), the specificity of these primers for amplifying DNA of A. solstitiale was verified by testing DNA extracts from seven starved P. cupreus and from mealworms (no amplification observed). Diagnostic PCRs were performed in 10-lL reactions containing 0.75 U Taq polymerase (GeneCraft, Cologne, Germany), 0.2 mM dNTPs (GeneCraft), 1 lL of 10· buffer (GeneCraft), 3 mM MgCl2 (GeneCraft), 1 lM of each primer, 1.5 lM bovine serum albumin (BSA; AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), 1.5 lL of DNA extract and 3.025 lL of PCR water (Qiagen). The thermocycler programme consisted of 2 min at 94 °C, 39 cycleswith15 sat94 °C,30 sat67 °C,45 sat72 °Canda final step of 2 min at 72 °C. Both positive (diluted DNA of A. solsitiale) and negative (PCR-grade water substituting DNA extract) controls were included in each PCR.
All samples scoring negative for prey DNA were reassayed with general invertebrate primers (Folmer et al. 1994) to test whether they contained amplifiable DNA. This test showed that there were no false-negative samples. The PCR mix was identical to the one described above. Thermocycling started with 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 48 °C and 45 s at72 °Candafinalstepof2 minat72 °C.
All PCR products were separated in 1.5% ethidium bromide–stained agarose gels at 90 V for 30 min and visualized on a UV transilluminator.
Statistical analysis
Meal size of predators was tested for significant differences between beetles frozen at different time points
using one-way ANOVA and Hochberg GT2 post hoc testing. Where ANOVA was not applicable (no homoscedasticity), Kruskal–Wallis ANOVAs were performed (Dytham 2010). To compare prey DNA detection success over time, LOGIT analysis was carried out (Field 2005). The time point for a prey detection probability of 50% was determined for each prey fragment size, and comparisons between fragments were based on 95% confidence limits (CI). Prey DNA detection rates were compared between two groups of samples using nonparametric McNemar test (Field 2005). All analyses were performed using SPSS (versions 15.0.1, 17 and 18).
Results
Feeding experiments
In the gut content and regurgitation experiments, the beetles’ meal sizes ranged between 25.4 and 47.5 mg, with no significant differences in their means between these two experiments (Table 1). In both feeding experiments, no significant difference in meal sizes was found among beetles sacrificed at different time points post-feeding.
In the gut content feeding experiment, prey DNA detection decreased with increasing digestion time for all three sizes of DNA fragments (Fig. 1a). The LOGIT model described this decline adequately: Pearson’s chisquare for small, medium and large prey amplicons was v2ð5Þ = 6.938 at P = 0.225, v2ð5Þ = 1.487 at P = 0.915 and v2ð5Þ = 7.768 at P = 0.169, respectively. The time span for the probability of a 50% prey detection success was negatively correlated with fragment size; however, there were no significant differences for this parameter between the fragment sizes (large fragment: 21.9 h, CI: 17.8 and 26.0 h; medium fragment: 26.6 h, CI: 23.3 and 30.0 h; small fragment: 30.2 h, CI: 25.4 and 41.2 h).

Detection was tested for three different prey DNA fragments: small (127 bp), medium (463 bp) and large (853 bp). For (a) and large prey DNA fragments in (b), fitted LOGIT models are provided.
Contrary to the gut content experiment, prey DNA detection was much higher at extended times post-feeding in beetles frozen after regurgitation: here, only for the large prey DNA fragment, a significant decline in detection success was observed (LOGIT model: Pearson chisquare v2ð5Þ = 2.201 at P = 0.821), with a model-derived 50% prey detection success probability of 28.8 h (CI: 24.0 and 38.5 h) (Fig. 1b). Finally, throughout all time points post-feeding, prey DNA detection was close to 100% in the regurgitate samples tested, no matter if they were screened for the presence of small, medium or large prey DNA fragments (Fig. 1c).
Long-term storage experiments
The mean meal size of beetles, fed in the experiments for long-term storage of samples, ranged between 35.8 and 43.8 mg (Table 1). Comparing mean meal size between 8and 16-h groups within each experiment, the 8-h group had consumed significantly less prey than the predators of the 16-h time point in P. cupreus stored at )28 °C (8-h group: 32.04 ± 9.89 mg SD; 16-h group 43.91 ± 12.6 mg SD, N = 20 for both groups; t-test: t = 3.312, P = 0.002). The reverse was true for the beetles used for regurgitate collection: here, the 8-h group consumed on average
8.6 mg more prey than the beetles frozen at 16 h postfeeding (8-h group: 40.14 ± 7.41 mg SD; 16-h group 31.52 ± 9.79 mg SD, N = 14 for both groups; t-test: t = 2.893, P = 0.007).
Prey DNA detection rates were above 70% for both types of beetle samples stored at )28 °C for 21 months prior to DNA extraction. Regurgitates stored in ethanol at room temperature gave very similar detection rates compared to the corresponding donor beetles with no significant differences between the two digestion times (Table 2). Contrasting results were obtained for whole beetles stored in ethanol: in beetles sacrificed 8 h postfeeding, all three prey DNA fragment sizes could be detected in almost all of the samples. However, prey DNA detection dropped dramatically for both medium and large prey DNA fragments in beetles digesting their meals for 16 h (Table 2).
Discussion
The current experiments demonstrate that regurgitates provide an ideal source of prey DNA. Considering the large prey DNA fragment, post-feeding prey detection success was significantly enhanced compared to wholebody extracts of beetles. No significant differences in

Feeding experiments abbreviations are as follows: GC-LT-beetle)28 °C for long-term storage GC-F (beetle storage at )28 °C), R-LT-beetle)28 °C for long-term storage R-F (beetle storage at )28 °C), R-LT-reg-EtOH for longterm storage R-F (regurgitate storage in 80% ethanol at room temperature) and LT-beetle-EtOH for long-term storage experiment with beetle storage in 80% ethanol at room temperature. Within each experiment, beetles were allowed to digest their prey for either 8 or 16 h. N is the number of samples analysed per digestion time. Only prey detection rates for the medium fragment size between 8or 16-h digestion times within the LT-beetle-EtOH experiment (bolded) were significantly different in the McNemar test (P < 0.018). Note that statistical comparisons could not be made for pairs where detection success was either 0% or 100%
present in the regurgitate (Raso, Sint & Traugott, unpublished), will allow a deeper understanding of individual dietary preferences in invertebrates that can be recaptured. Releasing the consumer after regurgitate collection, either immediately in the field or after a short laboratory phase, avoids diminishing population densities that might alter species interactions especially in systems where population numbers are small. Regurgitate sampling also offers a means to study the feeding ecology of rare and protected species. The advantages of analysing regurgitates from carabid beetles were studied previously: Paill (2004) investigated the predation of Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) on slugs by subjecting the carabid regurgitates to isoelectric focussing for the detection of esterase enzymes from consumed slugs. The regurgitates were harvested in the field by carefully squeezing the beetle’s abdomen and taking up the liquid using a micropipette, and thereafter the beetle was released. For this type of enzymatic analysis, the regurgitate samples need to be kept frozen to preserve prey enzyme activity, whereas with DNA-based prey detection, storing samples in ethanol is also possible, simplifying sample storage prior to analysis (see below). The PCR-based examination of faecal material from invertebrates, another nonlethal approach of dietary analysis, has so far been described for aquatic crustaceans only (Redd et al. 2008); the applicability of this approach for terrestrial invertebrates awaits confirmation.
The enhanced prey DNA detection success found in regurgitate samples compared to whole-body extracts of beetles can be explained by the high relative concentration of prey DNA present in the former. Additionally, both the concentration of consumer DNA and of other substances extracted alongside with the DNA, which can diminish prey DNA detection success (Juen & Traugott 2006), are much lower in regurgitates than in whole-body DNA extracts, improving detectability further. Removing the gut of predators (e.g. Harper et al. 2005; von Berg et al. 2008) or parts of their exoskeleton (e.g. wing covers) before DNA extraction has already been employed as a strategy to achieve purer DNA extracts to increase the prey DNA detection success, supporting this notion.
In terms of sample fixation and storage, the advantage of regurgitates is that they can be easily and quickly fixed in ethanol. Ethanol immediately inhibits the action of digestive enzymes, typically present in regurgitates (Traugott 2003), thereby efficiently preventing the food DNA from enzyme-derived damage. Ethanol also allows safe storage of regurgitates during longer field trips and sample transportation. The present results show, however, that these advantages hold true only for regurgitates while preserving whole invertebrate consumers in ethanol is less efficient, at least when storing them at room temperature for several months. This is probably

 amplification success were observed within the regurgitation experiment for small and medium amplicons, being high in both whole body and regurgitate samples. The present results also show that long-time storage of regurgitates in ethanol at room temperature has little impact on prey DNA detection: a drop in detection success of 􏰁30% in long-time storage compared to fresh regurgitates was observed only for the largest prey amplicon. The molecular examination of regurgitates thus provides many benefits for invertebrate dietary analysis: consumers that readily provide regurgitates do not need to be killed to gain the desired trophic data, prey DNA detection success is enhanced in regurgitates, and sample storage is made more convenient, both in the field and in-house. By not killing the consumer, new topics can be addressed which were previously intractable due to a lack in adequate methodology. For example, the analysis of stable isotopes showed that within insect species individual dietary specialization is present (Traugott et al. 2008).

caused by the longer time the ethanol needs to penetrate and fix the consumer’s gut content. This gives digestive processes enough time to critically reduce the number of medium and large prey DNA fragments, typically present in very low copy numbers at extended time postfeeding (Deagle et al. 2006). Ethanol storage of whole insect predators in a freezer, however, has shown to increase the preservation success of prey DNA: putting whole ladybird beetle larvae in prechilled ethanol and storing them at )20 °C was found to be the most effective fixation and preservation method to recover Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) prey DNA via qPCR among seven protocols tested (Weber & Lundgren 2009).
Aside from carabid beetles, regurgitation is also common in other arthropod taxa, for example in spiders (Kaestner 1993), grasshoppers (Sword 2000) or soildwelling invertebrate predators (Juen & Traugott 2007), indicating the wide applicability of the current approach to study their feeding ecology noninvasively. The benefits of regurgitate analysis described above, however, will only be realized when the invertebrates are not harmed during regurgitate sampling. This means that the regurgitate needs to be retrieved as gently as possible from the consumer. Getting invertebrates to regurgitate, however, can be a formidable task: for example, while regurgitates could be obtained easily in adults of P. melanarius using the technique described here for P. cupreus (also see Paill 2004), this method turned out to be unsuccessful for Harpalus rufipes (de Geer) (data not presented). In the latter species, the softer exoskeleton prohibited applying enough pressure on the beetle’s foregut to get it to regurgitate without harm. Thus, to bring regurgitate-based molecular diet analysis to its full potential, future work should explore techniques that allow retrieving regurgitates from invertebrates efficiently and gently.
