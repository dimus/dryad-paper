 abstract: Environmental change can shift the phenotype of an organism through either evolutionary or nongenetic processes. Despite abundant evidence of phenotypic change in response to recent climate change, we typically lack sufficient genetic data to identify the role of evolution. We present a method of using phenotypic data to characterize the hypothesized role of natural selection and environmentally driven phenotypic shifts (plasticity). We modeled historical selection and environmental predictors of interannual variation in mean population phenotype using a multivariate state-space model framework. Through model comparisons, we assessed the extent to which an estimated selection differential explained observed variation better than environmental factors alone. We applied the method to a 60-year trend toward earlier migration in Columbia River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, producing estimates of annual selection differentials, average realized heritability, and relative cumulative effects of selection and plasticity. We found that an evolutionary response to thermal selection was capable of explaining up to two-thirds of the phenotypic trend. Adaptive plastic responses to June river flow explain most of the remainder. This method is applicable to other populations with time series data if selection differentials are available or can be reconstructed. This method thus augments our toolbox for predicting responses to environmental change.

 Thackeray et al. 2010). Most of these responses appear to be adaptive (Parmesan and Yohe 2003) in the sense of increased fitness in the new climate relative to that of the historical phenotype. However, the extent to which they reflect evolution versus phenotypic plasticity is largely unknown (Gienapp et al. 2008). Phenotypic plasticity is environmentally induced variation in the phenotypic expression of a genotype; the reaction norm describes how the phenotype changes with environmental conditions (Woltereck 1909; Schlichting and Pigliucci 1998; Hutchings 2004). Because most phenotypic trends are documented at the population level, we employ the more general definition of plasticity, which consists of any consistent shift in the mean phenotype within a population in response to environmental conditions within a generation. The probability of extinction during rapid, directional environmental change might be reduced by either evolution or adaptive plasticity (or an interaction between the two; Ghalambor et al. 2007; Crispo et al. 2010). Nonetheless, the sustainability and maximal rates of phenotypic change differ between these two processes (Reed et al. 2011a), leading to very different fates over time. In addition to long-term prospects, effective management of living resources depends crucially on distinguishing between these processes. For example, the potential consequences of fishery-induced selection on key life-history traits, such as age of reproduction, include nonlinear ecological transitions (Jorgensen et al. 2007) and population collapse (Olsen et al. 2004) and ultimately could greatly slow population recovery despite relaxation of selection (Enberg et al. 2009; Swain 2011). Evolutionary and plastic responses also differ greatly in their effects on interannual variation in phenotypes. Many management decisions depend on correctly predicting annual population abundance and phenology, so an understanding of the factors driving interannual variation has practical applications (e.g., water allocation,
 Introduction
The most widespread documented response by natural populations to recent climate change involves shifts in the timing of life-history events, such as flight period, leaf out, reproduction, and migration (Roy and Sparks 2000; Walther et al. 2002; Parmesan and Yohe 2003; Root et al. 2003; Parmesan 2006; Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2008;

Plasticity might account for most recently observed phenotypic shifts (Gienapp et al. 2007), because in many cases populations have failed to adapt genetically to environmental change despite seemingly strong selection (Merila ̈ et al. 2001; Gienapp et al. 2006, 2008). Unfortunately, in most cases we do not know the extent to which the observed phenotypic response reflects genetic change because we lack either extensive pedigrees (e.g., Garant et al. 2004; Ozgul et al. 2009; Coulson et al. 2010) or common-garden experiments (e.g., Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2001). To show that climate change caused the trait shifts, these experiments must span decades. Because such data are difficult or impossible to attain in many organisms, novel approaches to inferring evolutionary change are urgently needed (e.g., Spottiswoode et al. 2006; Dieckmann and Heino 2007; Kraak 2007; Phillimore et al. 2010).
We approached this challenge by assessing the extent to which observed phenotypic patterns were consistent with specific hypotheses that included evolutionary responses, phenotypic plasticity, or both. Swain et al. (2007) pioneered this approach to model evolutionary responses to size selectivity in fisheries while controlling for the effects of temperature and animal density on growth rates. The approach relies on an independent estimate of selection differentials and a time series of environmental and phenotypic values. The method was designed for populations lacking pedigree information, necessitating certain assumptions about the underlying genetic architecture and targets of selection. Thus, the method does not provide a definitive answer on the role of evolution but rather addresses the question, can a specific type of selection explain a large amount of the observed interannual variation in mean phenotype?
This method tests a more specific hypothesis than alternatives that compare reaction norms over time without mechanistically accounting for change (e.g., Olsen et al. 2004). Results from this type of analysis can be used to rule out some hypotheses or justify the expense of a largescale experimental study. The advantage of this approach is its ability to use results from short-term measurements of selection, for example, to hindcast selection over a historical time series. The resulting hindcast can then be compared to the predicted phenotypes with and without selection as part of the process. We expanded on the efforts of Swain et al. (2007) by using a new statistical methodology and expanding the array of potential environmental effects.
To demonstrate the approach, we investigate drivers of a long-term trend toward earlier upstream migration date in adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka Walbaum). Sockeye salmon now migrate up the Columbia River 10.3
 days earlier, on average, than they did in the 1940s (fig. 1A). Quinn and Adams (1996) argued that warming has selected for earlier migration, and indeed, water temperature records in the lower river show a rise of 2.6􏱟C in mean July temperature since 1949 (fig. 1B; DART 2011). To update and more explicitly test this hypothesis, we developed a functional model relating survival during upstream migration to temperature on the basis of the results of recent studies that tracked individual fish through the migration. We hindcast this function over the historical record to estimate the putative selection differential over the time series. Next we assembled a set of possible environmental drivers of interannual variation in migration timing from the literature. A state-space modeling framework was then used to combine selection and these environmental variables as covariates to explain mean population migration date in a formal time-series analysis. We used model-selection techniques to determine which factors best predicted annual migration timing. Our results showed strong support for the role of selection when combined with a plastic response to river flow. We did not attempt to describe the full complexity of factors affecting these fish (for more information, see Fryer 1995; Gustafson et al. 1997; Hyatt et al. 2003; Waples et al. 2008); rather, we sought to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in identifying an important role of evolution in driving observed phenological trends.
Methods
Justification of Approach
Our analysis was motivated by well-established evolutionary principles. Specifically, any phenotype depends on (1) genetic determinants and (2) environmental influences on the phenotypic expression of the trait. Without direct genotypic or pedigree information, we could not exactly decompose all of the genetic and environmental correlates of fitness (Price 1970, 1972) as is required to fully describe the evolutionary process (e.g., Ozgul et al. 2009, 2010; Coulson et al. 2010). However, in certain situations, the simpler “breeder’s equation” effectively predicts expected changes in phenotypes due to selection (Falconer and Mackay 1996). The breeder’s equation states that an evolutionary response, R, to selection depends only on the strength of selection, S, scaled by the heritability, h2. Heritability is defined as the ratio between the additive genetic variance and the total phenotypic variance in the trait. This application relies on the critical assumption that the observed correlation between phenotype and fitness corresponds directly to an underlying correlation between genotype and fitness (Morrissey et al. 2010), among other assumptions (Lynch and Walsh 1997). Despite this caveat,

 the breeder’s equation provides a useful tool to identify cases where selection strongly influences phenotypic change.
In our conceptual model, natural selection acts on the intercept of the population mean reaction norm (for alternative possibilities, see Nussey et al. 2005). If we can specify the relevant environmental or demographic factors that determine the reaction norm and adequately characterize the selective pressures affecting the trait across the range of conditions encountered, then we should be able to explain most of the variation in mean phenotype over a time series. Thus, we can use a statistical model to explore various explanatory hypotheses. That is, we used an estimate of a quantitative genetic parameter in our analysis but the model itself is not a quantitative genetic model.
 Our framework can readily accommodate nonlinear reaction norms and more complicated relationships between selection, environmental conditions, and plastic phenotypic responses. However, here we applied the simplest assumptions of linear reaction norms and additive evolutionary and environmental effects.
Our statistical model combined the breeders’ equation with a population mean reaction norm to predict mean migration date in a particular year. We began with the model described by Lynch and Walsh (1997, Ch. 6):
zt p Gt 􏱘 Et 􏱘 et, (1)
where zt is the population mean phenotype at time t, Gt is the mean genetic effect, Et is the mean general environmental effect, and e includes all residual environmental

 effects. We simply extended the principle of general environmental effects shared by groups of individuals (Et) to a functional response, f(Et), which we characterized by the reaction norm (we ignore other sources of general environmental effects). We assumed that genetic effects on the intercept and systematic environmental effects were additive (i.e., we ignored genotype-by-environment interactions), such that
zt pGt􏱘f(Et)􏱘et. (2)
Then, to compare the mean phenotype in the offspring generation zt with that of the parental generation zt􏱛1, we simply differenced equation (2) between times t and t 􏱛 1 and replaced the change in genetic effects between generations (Gt 􏱛 Gt􏱛1) with h2S from the breeder’s equation:
zt p zt􏱛1 􏱘h2St􏱛1 􏱘f(Et 􏱛Et􏱛1)􏱘et 􏱛et􏱛1. (3)
In the resulting model, e includes all sources of variation not explicitly specified in the other two terms (nonadditive genetic effects and all other environmental effects).
Thus, we imagine that in each generation, selection modifies the intercept of the parental reaction norm. This reflects a time-series process in which covariates modify the autocorrelation between parents and offspring. Note that an evolutionary response acts somewhat differently from annual environmental effects because evolution in one generation will affect all future generations. Therefore, unidentified directional selection should generate an especially strong signal of “process error” because of its consistent bias. Process error results from misspecification of the deterministic component of a model; with repeated simulations of the same dynamic model, variance in predictions accumulates over time. Observation error, on the other hand, reflects measurement error, or difficulty in detecting the true state, and is assumed to be unrelated to the time of the measurement (Bolker 2008). Errors in specifying the reaction norm also increase process error but are not necessarily as consistently biased as directional selection. Even without this subtle difference in the process error among the possible covariates, separating out observation error can greatly improve model results. Thus, we need a statistical method that differentiates between process and observation error to maximize our ability to identify potential selection.
We employed state-space modeling to get the most information from our data. A state-space approach assumes a stochastic process (e.g., a random walk) that could be caused by drift or selection on correlated traits in addition to explicitly modeled factors. This approach works one generation at a time and thus reduces complications from change in genetic variance and drift that accrue over longer time periods. To accommodate the life history of our study
 population, we modified the standard state-space equations into a multivariate form in which we treated annual cohorts as replicate realizations of a shared underlying process.
Misidentification of environmental forcing factors or inadequate characterization of the evolutionary response will generally reduce the amount of variation explained and thus lower the overall fit of the model as well as the significance of individual predictors. Most importantly, the hypothesized selection agent might not actually affect the phenotype, perhaps because of low heritability, correlations among traits that inhibit an evolutionary response, or selection not actually acting on underlying breeding values. In this case, this predictor will not explain much variation in the data and hence will not appear in highly weighted models. This does not mean that selection is not occurring or that the trait is not heritable, just that it is not having a detectable effect on the phenotype at this gross level and thus cannot explain the pattern of interest. Consequently, the method is generally conservative in that it tends to underestimate evolutionary processes, with one exception. It is possible that the true processes are coincidentally highly correlated with modeled predictors. Therefore, if substantial variation can be explained, we can conclude that the observations are consistent with our hypothesis but not that there is a causal relationship. This type of conclusion is still useful in either justifying the effort and expense of further experiments or limiting the number of necessary treatments to those highly correlated with the modeled variables.
Application: Columbia River Sockeye Salmon
Migration timing in Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. is highly population specific, primarily reflecting local adaptation to seasonal variation in temperature and flow along the migration route and at spawning grounds (Quinn and Adams 1996; Hilborn et al. 2003; Keefer et al. 2008a; O’Malley and Banks 2008; Doctor et al. 2010). The few formal studies of heritability in adult migration and spawn timing have demonstrated a heritable basis in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; h2 p 0.18–0.39 [Smoker et al. 1998]) and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; h 2 ∼ 1 [Quinn et al. 2000]; h 2 p 0.23 􏱠 0.17 [Hard 2004]). Experimental manipulations with juvenile migrants indicate that salmon use a combination of photoperiod, thermal cues, and physiological state information (i.e., growth rate or size thresholds) to trigger migration (Pereira and Adelman 1985; Muir et al. 1992, 1994; Beckman et al. 2007; McCormick et al. 2007; Sykes et al. 2009; Sykes and Shrimpton 2010). Adult migration is more difficult to manipulate experimentally, but photoperiod and temperature also affect the timing of mat-

 uration (Beacham and Murray 1988). Latitudinal gradients in the length of the PolyQ segment of the photoperiodsensitive Clock gene correlate with seasonal behavior patterns such as spawn timing and appear to be under selection (O’Malley and Banks 2008; O’Malley et al. 2010). We consider evolutionary change in the critical photoperiod during which migration might be initiated as analogous to an effect on the intercept of the reaction norm because it would presumably shift the whole migration period by a fixed amount.
High temperatures during migration can impose strong selection on all Pacific salmon species. Temperatures greater than ∼18􏱟C generally reduce survival during the adult migration (Macdonald et al. 2000; Crossin et al. 2008; Farrell et al. 2008; Marcogliese 2008) and may reduce embryo viability even if the mother survives (Mann 2007). The response to selection might include enhanced heat tolerance or a shift in migration timing to avoid thermal stress. Different populations of sockeye salmon migrating through Canada’s Fraser River vary in how temperature affects survival (Martins et al. 2011). These differences might reflect local adaptation in aerobic scope (Lee et al. 2003; Farrell et al. 2008), variation in disease exposure (Miller et al. 2011), body condition (Crossin et al. 2004), body size, or state of reproductive maturation. Here we assume that selection primarily targets migration timing, largely because for this response we have clear evidence of change. Additional selection might have acted on thermal tolerance, making our estimate of the total impact of evolution conservative. More generally, across the geographic range of sockeye salmon, normal migration dates vary widely and never coincide with average river temperatures exceeding 19􏱟C (Hodgson and Quinn 2002).
Populations considered here persist at the southern edge of the species’ range. Most adult sockeye salmon enter the Columbia River in June and July, before peak summer temperatures occur. The Okanogan population sometimes experiences temperature-induced migration blockages, during which time the fish wait in the cooler upper Columbia River for temperatures in the Okanogan River to drop below 21􏱟C (Major and Mighell 1967; Hyatt et al. 2003). The adult migration occurs only once in a lifetime in most Pacific salmon, precluding estimates of individual plasticity in the usual manner (e.g., Reale et al. 2003; Nussey et al. 2005).
Reconstructing Historical Selection Differentials
Sockeye salmon in the Columbia River currently comprise two main population groups, the Wenatchee and the Okanogan river basin evolutionarily significant units (842 river kilometers from the Pacific Ocean [rkm] and 986 rkm, respectively; fig. 2). A very small percentage (currently
 !1%) undertake the longest migration of any major sockeye salmon population in the world, 1,435 rkm, to Redfish Lake in Idaho. The two main populations differ in age structure: in both populations, 68% of spawners are age 4 on average, but in the Wenatchee Basin the remainder are mostly age 5 while in the Okanogan they are mostly age 3 (Gustafson et al. 1997). Furthermore, although migration timing overlaps extensively, in some years Wenatchee fish migrate earlier than Okanogan fish (Chapman et al. 1995; Fryer 2007, 2008; but not Naughton 2005 or Fryer 2009). Nonetheless, these populations cannot be reliably distinguished in the lower river. We therefore combine them in this analysis but include an index of population proportions.
Since standardized daily counts began in 1938 upon completion of Bonneville Dam, which is located 235 rkm from the mouth of the Columbia River, 9,000–240,000 sockeye salmon adults have been recorded migrating in spring and early summer each year (DART 2011). To calculate historical selection differentials, we first examined the relationship between migration survival and river temperature on basis of the survival of fish tracked with unique tags in 1997 (Naughton et al. 2005) and from 2006 through 2010 (Fryer 2007, 2008; PTAGIS 2010). It is possible that the survival function has evolved over time, as previously discussed. However, to the extent that more intense selection earlier in the time series resulted in evolution of thermal tolerance, it would not have affected migration date. We used the 1997 study in our primary analysis because it tracked fish all the way to their spawning grounds, whereas later studies reflected survival only as far as Rock Island Dam (730 rkm; fig. 2). The 2006–2010 studies confirmed the 1997 results, that survival is lower at higher temperatures (fig. 3B). Importantly, they also showed that in cool years (2008–2010), survival remains high throughout the season (fig. 3B), so migration date exhibits no independent effect after accounting for temperature. One additional study of survival of Redfish Lake sockeye salmon through the Snake River also found that survival drops sharply at higher temperatures (Keefer et al. 2008b).
After removing harvested fish (as reported by fishers) from the 1997 study, we modeled migration survival (defined as the proportion of released fish arriving at a spawning tributary) as a function of temperature by grouping fish according to the temperature they encountered at Bonneville Dam (“temperature cohorts”). Archival tags inserted in migrating Columbia River chinook salmon and steelhead reveal that fish frequently experience temperatures that are higher and more variable than those recorded in the scroll case at the dam (Clabough et al. 2008), but the scroll case provides a long-term record that should be correlated with the temperatures experienced. We treated

 survival as a binomial variable, constrained between 0 and 1. Because of the strong seasonal trend and the low daily variation in river temperature, the temperature at Bonneville Dam correlates strongly with the temperatures fish encounter upstream as the migration progresses. In selecting a functional form for our model of selection, we focused on survival over the range 11􏱟–25􏱟C to span daily migration temperatures experienced from 1949 to 2010. We assumed high survival from 11􏱟 to 14􏱟C on the basis of literature reports (McCullough 1999; Crossin et al. 2008). The data showed a precipitous drop in survival in the 17􏱟–20􏱟C range (fig. 3A). To capture this, we chose a three-parameter hyperbolic tangent function:
P pa#arctan[b(T􏱛T )], (4) T 50
where PT is the probability of survival at temperature T, a is maximum survival at cool temperatures, b is the rate at which survival declines with temperature (slope), and T50 is the temperature associated with 50% of the maximum survival. We estimated model parameters, using
 maximum likelihood estimation and assuming a binomial error distribution in R (R Development Core Team 2010, package bbmle). We generated confidence intervals about the survival relationship by drawing the three parameters of equation (2) from a multivariate normal random distribution 100 times, using the mean and covariance matrix of the parameter estimates from the fit to the 1997 data. We ran the model as described below for each of these 100 survival functions, producing 100 estimates of each of our response metrics, from which we report the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles.
To calculate the historical annual strength of selection, we used daily mean water temperature measured in the scroll case at Bonneville Dam (DART 2011) on the day of passage for each fish in the historical count from 1950 to 2010 to calculate the probability the fish would survive the migration, using equation (4). The temperature record at Bonneville lacks data from 1960 to 1979, so we predicted those temperatures by regression with temperatures re-

For each fish in the daily count in each year, we drew its fate from a binomial distribution with the probability
 of survival determined by the temperatures that fish experienced at Bonneville Dam. We then calculated the median migration date of all of the survivors in our simulation compared with that of all of the migrants to determine the annual selection differential. Because of the stochastic nature of individual survival in the model, we repeated this procedure in 1,000 simulations to determine the mean and standard deviation of the selection differential estimated for each year. We used the median instead of the mean because migration timing is not normally distributed.
Environmental Predictors of Migration Timing
The high variation in annual migration timing (fig. 1A) clearly exceeds that which could be explained by genetic factors alone. Whether this variation initiates near the river mouth or far out at sea is not known. To model the nonevolutionary component of migration timing, therefore, we considered a set of factors describing both river and ocean conditions that have been identified in the literature for either sockeye or chinook salmon. Specifically, Hodgson et al. (2006) found that June mean temperature and June mean flow (but not various indices of sea surface temperature chosen to match the ocean migration) were significant predictors of Columbia River sockeye salmon migration timing (r 2 p 0.27–0.33). Similarly, Keefer et al. (2008a) found that flow and temperature during the peak migration as well as two ocean indices (PDO and NPI, see below) explained 40%–50% of the variation in annual migration timing in Columbia River spring chinook salmon. We therefore included mean June temperature (T) and mean June flow (F) measured at Bonneville Dam (DART 2011). We added another freshwater indicator we thought might be more sensitive than monthly average flow, namely, the date of peak flow (FP).
We further included four indicators of ocean conditions that are expected to correlate with more proximate cues or physiological constraints at sea (e.g., food availability or current strength): the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the North Pacific Index (NPI), the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), and upwelling (U). The PDO index (Mantua 2005) reflects sea surface temperatures over a large area of the Pacific Ocean and correlates with broad weather patterns. The NPI (Trenberth and Hurrell 2009) reflects variation in sea surface pressure, especially the Aleutian Low Pressure Index, and it correlates with wind patterns, storm tracks, and ocean productivity at a broad scale. The NPGO (Di Lorenzo et al. 2008) reflects variation in wind-driven upwelling and horizontal advection across the North Pacific, which correlates strongly with variation in salinity and nutrient availability. Each of the three largescale indices exhibits high temporal autocorrelation, so we

where the b variables are regression coefficients and X1 ... n represents different environmental indices. The normally distributed process error (wt) has a mean of 0 and variance Q. The scaling factor bs corrects for potential biases in our estimate of the selection differential. For example, because we calculated the selection differential for the combined populations and used stage-specific survival rather than fitness, we might have underestimated the full costs of exposure to high temperature. In practice, because h2 can change over time and is not well known, we collapse bsh2 into a single coefficient fitted to the data, which we call the average realized h2, given our estimate of S.
We assume that Columbia River sockeye salmon have a generation time of 4 years (i.e., k p 4), because in both populations, on average, 68% of the spawners are 4 years old. We rewrite equation (5􏷳) as

State-space models are often formulated so that the lag k p 1 in equation (5), which would be appropriate for organisms with annual discrete generations. To represent the overlapping, 4-year average generation time of sockeye salmon, we developed a multivariate form of the state-space approach to treat cohorts as essentially separate populations that can be solved simultaneously. To do this, we divided our original 60-year time series into four differenced time series, each 56 years or 14 generations long, for each migration date and covariate (see appendix A, available online, for a full explanation of state vectors and associated matrices). For example, Y (1) p {Y1955 , Y1959 , Y1963 , ... , Y2007} and Y (2) p {Y1956 , Y1960 , Y1964 , ... , Y2008}. Denoting generation by t, the response vector then becomes

averaged each index from December to June for a single annual value. We note that wind stress and salinity off Vancouver Island correlate closely with sockeye salmon arrival timing in the Fraser River (Thomson and Hourston 2011). Finally, we added an index of upwelling near the mouth of the Columbia River (45􏱟N) in March, April, and May (PFEL 2008) to describe ocean productivity more locally during the final approach to the river.
Population Composition
Redfish Lake sockeye salmon migrate somewhat earlier than Upper Columbia River sockeye salmon, so the decline of this population could not have caused the advance in migration timing observed; if anything, it should have had the opposite effect (Quinn et al. 1997). However, longterm declines in the latest population to migrate (or increases in earlier-migrating populations) could have caused the observed trend. Reliable spawner counts from the Wenatchee population are not available for most of the period of record. However, because Wenatchee fish leave the Columbia River after passing Rock Island Dam (fig. 2), the ratio of fish counted at upstream Columbia dams to those counted at Rock Island Dam provides an index of relative population size. We selected Wells Dam as our upstream dam because it has the longest period of record (1967–1977, Fryer 1995; 1978–2010, DART 2011). Mortality between the two dams appears to be very low, based on tracked fish. To account for these potential population effects on migration timing, we included this index (WRI) as a predictor variable in the models that follow.
Time Series Model
We used a multivariate state-space model to translate equation (3) into a statistical model describing changes in migration date over time with respect to environmental drivers and selection. A state-space model is composed of (1) a process model that describes the underlying dynamics of a true but unobserved state and (2) an observation model that relates the states to an associated series of observations (Durbin and Koopman 2002). Both the process and the observation components are generally assumed to be stochastic. State-space models have a long history of applications in engineering (Jazwinski 1970), statistics (Harvey 1989), and economic forecasting (West and Harrison 1997). Applications of state-space models in the ecological literature are also increasingly common (e.g., Dennis et al. 2006; Patterson et al. 2008; Ward et al. 2010).
We began with a univariate process model of median
migration date for a cohort returning in year t (Dt), which

 differenced each of the environmental covariates X by lag p 4 so we could treat them as a single predictor comparable to S. All of the covariates, including S, for a given model are grouped into a new vector z that puts generational effects in the appropriate year. The initial state vector (d0) is distributed as a multivariate normal with mean vector m and diagonal variance matrix C (the covariance of the initial states is assumed to be 0). Process and observation error also have multivariate normal distributions, with means of 0 and variance of Q and R, respectively. Combining all of these terms, our multivariate state-space model is thus given by

We used a Kalman filter (Shumway and Stoffer 2006) to estimate the states d, regression parameters b, variance matrices Q and R, and the mean of the initial state m. Because of computational problems associated with estimating both m and C, we set each element along the diagonal of C equal to 106 in order to reduce the influence of the initial state on subsequent estimates (i.e., essentially a vague prior in the Bayesian sense).
Model Comparison
To estimate the relative importance of covariates, we developed a suite of alternative models that expressed migration date as a function of all possible combinations of the selection differential and candidate environmental variables (eq. [9]). We centered environmental and population predictor variables on their means during the study period and standardized them by their root mean square values. We did not standardize the time series of selection differentials because the native standard deviation already approached 1 (SD, 1.45) and we wanted to interpret the resulting coefficient in relation to a selection differential of 1 day. The only covariate not available for all years was the index of the relative proportions of Okanogan and Wenatchee populations. Therefore, we first ran the model comparison from 1950 to 2009 (for an even 14 generations per cohort) for the other predictors and then repeated the analysis, including population composition, using data from 1967 to 2010 (10 generations).
We considered all combinations of variables (listed in table 1) with no more than three covariates per model. We then ranked all models using the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc; Burnham and Anderson 2002), where dAICc is the difference in AICc between any given model and the best model such that the best model has dAICc p 0. The Akaike weight (w) describes the weight of evidence in support of a particular
ttt
 model relative to the entire set of models considered, given the data. We used w to compute the relative importance of each variable by summing w across all models that include that variable. We computed the model-averaged estimate for a given parameter by weighting the parameter coefficient from model i by wi and taking the weightedaverage coefficient across all models (Burnham and Anderson 2002). This technique incorporates model uncertainty by using information from all models explored rather than selecting a single best model.
To visualize the shift in reaction norm independently of our time-series analysis, we applied simple multiple linear regression, using only environmental covariates with the first and last 15 years of the record, respectively, to produce two functions. Because flow was the best environmental predictor of migration time (see “Results”), we modeled median migration date as a function flow and compared the projected migration times over the entire series, using the early and late parameter estimates.
Sensitivity Analysis
We explored the sensitivity of our results to uncertainty in the survival model (eq. [4]) by analyzing each of the three model parameters across a range of estimates that bracket fits to all years of data, 1997 and 2006–2010 (fig. 3B). We tested all permutations with T50 from 18 to 21 in increments of 0.5; maximum survival a at 0.825, 0.875, and 0.925; and slopes b from 􏱛2 to 􏱛0.5 in increments of 0.5 (fig. 3B, light and dark gray lines). For each set of parameter values, we calculated the yearly selection differential as described above. We then ran the state-space model and calculated the model-averaged coefficient values and variable weights. Again, all models with 0 (random walk alone) to three predictors were tested, but in this case we included only four covariates, S, F, PDO, and NPGO.
Results
We found a clear relationship between increasing water temperature and decreasing survival of adult sockeye salmon during their upstream migration (fig. 3). Our analysis of temperature effects on migration timing produced a mean selection differential of just over 1 day per generation (􏱛1.05 [95% CI, 􏱛1.43 to 􏱛0.72]; standardized S p 􏱛0.11 [95% CI, 􏱛0.15 to 􏱛0.076]; mean migration period SD p 8.8 days). The strongest selection occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s (fig. 4A).
The state-space model explained most of the variation in migration timing observed in the historical record (generalized R2 for the top model was 0.8; table 2; modelaveraged fit shown in fig. 4B). Among all of the predictor variables we examined, selection was clearly important: it

 was present in all of the models comprising the 95% confidence set (table 2) and had a variable weight of 1 (table 1). Flow (F) had the highest absolute impact on variation in migration date, as indicated by the high coefficients shown in table 1. The simplest model with strong support was D ∼ S􏱘F (dAICc p 1.5, w p 0.113; table 2). The PDO or NPGO improved the AICc score, although not enough to indicate strong support. A more refined ocean indicator might have better captured this driving influence and warrants further study. The coefficients of other indices did not differ significantly from 0 even in models where they appeared. Despite the strong correlation between temperature and flow (r p 0.72), there was no support for a direct effect of temperature (note that in table 1, the variable weight for temperature was only 0.06).
Intriguingly, a major difference in the model fits between models that included S and those that did not emerged in the estimate of process error. The mean estimate of 􏸥Q was 0.024 􏱠 0.019 SD when the model included S and 1.6 􏱠 0.1 when the model did not include S (table 2). The models did not differ much in estimates
  of observation error: 􏸥R p 2.7 􏱠 0.1 SD with S or 􏸥R p 2.5 􏱠 0.2 SD without S. This impact on process error largely explains the high weight of S.
When we considered only the years with an index of population composition based on dam counts, 1967–2010, the results were nearly identical (tables 1, 2). The top model was S􏱘F􏱘PDO, but S􏱘F had a dAICc of only 1 and again S had a variable weight near 1. Thus, population composition did not help to explain variation in migration date, nor did relative population proportions show any trend over time (F p 0.04, P p .8).

The response variable is median migration date and the predictor variables are the selection differential (S); mean June flow (F); date of peak flow (FP); mean June temperature (T) at Bonneville Dam; December–June mean Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), and North Pacific Index (NPI); and the upwelling index (245 in March [UMar], April [UApr], and May [UMay]).
 other response metric. Lower T50 values increased the magnitude of both the mean and the variance in S (fig. 5A), because average and warm years exposed a larger proportion of the population to lethally high temperatures while cool years retained a selection differential of 0. A combination of low T50 and steep slope amplified this effect. Lower T50 values produced a lower estimate of heritability, closer to 0.2, while higher T50 values produced heritability coefficients over 1 (fig. 5B). High T50 generated an essentially flat vector S (almost no years saw any selection at all), and hence S explained little variation in the data and variable weight declined (fig. 5C). However, while T50 was 20.5 or less, variable weight was ≥0.8, showing strong support for selection. Thus, the general model results agreed for a wide variety of survival curves as long as some selection occurred.
 Discussion
As “the newest synthesis” of evolutionary and ecological dynamics (Schoener 2011) gains traction, diverse techniques are needed to gain long-term perspective on phenotypic change. We presented an analytical approach where we combined evolutionary and plastic processes to explain long-term variability in a phenotypic trait. The approach proved powerful in showing that evolutionary processes could explain variation that we could not explain using the best available information about driving environmental factors. It requires fairly detailed information about potential mechanisms of selection (or a direct estimate), but it is not a quantitative genetic model and hence does not rely on genetic data. Our method is potentially valuable for understanding observed variability in

 phenotypes, particularly when those phenotypes appear to be responding to strong impacts such as species introductions, exploitation, and environmental change.
This method has several advantages over other techniques for reconstructing drivers of responses to environmental change. First, it explicitly accounts for both evolutionary and ecological processes and can incorporate either biotic or abiotic drivers. Second, it employs typical ecological data on survival and phenotypic variation over time and environmental covariates available for a variety of species. Third, it specifically tests a particular target of selection that quantitative genetic studies frequently do not (see review in Gienapp et al. 2008). Although phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations could mask the true target and response to selection, short-term experiments can help to resolve causal mechanisms.
The crucial ingredients for the approach are (1) a time series of phenotypes, (2) a hypothesized evolutionary mechanism driving variation in the trait and the ability to measure or reconstruct the strength of selection on the trait over the full length of the time series, and (3) a hypothesized plastic mechanism driving variation in the trait and a historical record of this factor. The first requirement is increasingly being met by consolidation and improved access to historical data sets (e.g., public data repositories such as Dryad [http://datadryad.org] and national databases such as the National Phenological Network [http://www.usanpn.org], in addition to data collected by government agencies). For the second requirement, more authors are developing long histories of selection differentials (references cited in Siepielski et al. 2009). For example, Johnson (2011) reconstructed 34 years of selection on banding in land snails in Australia. Kendall et al. (2009) reconstructed 57 years of gill-net selection on size-selective harvests of Alaskan sockeye salmon from catch data. Carlson and Quinn (2007) backcalculated 54 years of selection on body size in sockeye salmon in Lake Alegnavik in Alaska on the basis of direct estimates of selection over 10 years and a strong correlation between selection and lake level. Van Asch et al. (2007) used environmental data to back-calculate both phenology and selection time series (from development-time models and short-term selection experiments, respectively). The third requirement can similarly be met by either shortterm experiments describing reaction norms (e.g., Hutchings et al. 2007) or observational data (e.g., Kraak 2007) or inferred from time series, as we have done. Body size has well-known ecological determinants, and some of the selection studies cited above could readily be extended to apply our approach (e.g., Carlson and Quinn 2007; Kendall et al. 2009). Growing appreciation of the interactions between ecological and evolutionary dynamics (Schoener 2011) indicate that the time is right for combining these
 traditionally disparate approaches to generate useful models of responses to anthropogenic and climate impacts. Historically, many temporal fluctuations in selection might have balanced each other out in a relatively stable climate. But with directional changes in climate upon us, increasingly directional selection might produce stronger responses than previously observed (Siepielski et al. 2009; Kingsolver and Diamond 2011).
In applying this method to populations of sockeye salmon, the most striking result we have observed has been that incorporating an evolutionary response to rising temperatures has significantly improved our ability to predict migration timing over any combination of direct environmental responses considered alone, most notably including direct effects of temperature. This result proved very robust to uncertainty in the form of the selection function and population composition.
Although not a quantitative genetic model, our approach produces an estimate of the mean impact of selection from one generation to the next, which is equivalent to a mean realized heritability. Our estimate of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.36–0.62) is a little higher than might be expected for the true heritability of this trait on the basis of the Hard et al. (2004) estimate of 0.24 􏱠 0.17 and the Smoker et al. (1998) estimate of 0.18–0.39, but it is not unreasonable. In fact, preliminary analysis of arrival timing using a full pedigree and the animal model in a wild sockeye salmon population in Bristol Bay, Alaska, produced an estimate nearly identical to ours, h2 p 0.521 (95% CI, 0.478–0.551; J. Hard, unpublished data). However, our estimate is very sensitive to the magnitude of selection (fig. 5B). We caution against overinterpretation, given the uncertainty in the selection differential stemming from the use of survival rather than fitness itself and of populationspecific impacts. Regardless, our results suggest that selection can easily account for the 3-day shift in reactionnorm elevation between the two lines shown in figure 4C. Declines in June flow occurred largely in the first half of the time series (fig. 1C) because of construction of 18 major dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers from 1954 to 1975. These changes in flow alone could account for a 6-day shift on the basis of the net change in the early reaction norm shown in figure 4C. Our model suggests, however, that selection explains even more of the overall shift in migration date and could account for a 7-day advance (0.49 # mean cumulative selection). Thus, selection could explain oneto two-thirds of the total trend observed. Apparently, the evolutionary response of these sockeye salmon populations reduced their exposure to potentially lethal river temperatures in recent years.
Without genetic information or a controlled experiment, we cannot rule out the possibility that the calculated selection differential just happens to correlate highly with

 some crucial alternative target of selection or driving environmental variable not included in the model. The most important time period encompassing a trend explained by selection but not by other processes has been the last two decades. The most likely alternative driver of selection historically was fishing, as demonstrated in Alaskan sockeye salmon (Quinn et al. 2007). However, catch has been relatively low since the 1970s and hence cannot explain the recent trend. Similarly, other responses to dam construction would mostly predate the period of interest. Hatcheries selected for earlier migration in some coho salmon populations (Ford et al. 2006, 2008), but they operate here at a very small scale relative to the wild populations. Most other hypothesized selective forces would oppose earlier migration. Rather than explaining the observed trend, they suggest that stabilizing selection might have been underestimated and become increasingly important. Specifically, likely costs to earlier migration for the populations considered here include lost feeding opportunity in the ocean; increased harvest, predation, or injury in holding pools (Keefer et al. 2009); and higher energetic costs of spending the summer in warm water without food. Numerous other factors also affect these populations (Fryer 1995; Quinn et al. 1997; Hyatt et al. 2003). Nonetheless, we believe that the strong performance and reasonable foundation underlying our model supports the general conclusion that an evolutionary response to rising temperatures is the most parsimonious explanation.
The warming of the Columbia River reflects both the construction of large reservoirs and rising air temperatures. Rising air temperatures affect salmon throughout their range, so has a widespread response in migration timing occurred? A recent survey (Hodgson et al. 2006) of migration timing of sockeye salmon throughout their range found that 18 (36%) of 53 populations had significant trends over time. A similar proportion of river temperature (5 [36%] of 14) and sea-surface temperature regressions (4 [44%] of 9) showed a significant warming trend. Strong correlations between shifts in migration timing and rising river temperatures have also been documented in Alaskan pink salmon (Taylor 2008) and Atlantic salmon throughout the northeastern United States (Juanes et al. 2004). Thus, a pattern of shifting migration timing in fish mirrors patterns that have been observed extensively in other taxa (Parmesan and Yohe 2003).
In conclusion, we present this methodology as a first estimate of the potential evolutionary consequences of changing environmental conditions. Ignoring these effects could produce substantial bias in analyses of the effects of climate change. Although our estimates of selection and its evolutionary consequences are indirect, they support growing evidence that flexible life histories provide some protection from environmental change and involve both
 heritable and nonheritable traits. The amount of evolutionary change estimated here, 0.03 haldanes, is typical of numerous studies of contemporary evolution (Hendry and Kinnison 1999; Kingsolver et al. 2001), and we suggest that it will play an important role in protecting species from extinction during ongoing climate change, as demonstrated in recent simulations of evolution in Fraser River sockeye salmon (Reed et al. 2011b). Although directional selection might not have led to substantial phenotypic change to date (Kingsolver and Diamond 2011), because environmental conditions drive so many of these relationships (Siepielski et al. 2009), directional environmental changes are very likely to induce more rapid evolution in the future. Whether cues that regulate the plastic response will continue to be adaptive in future climates remains a paramount concern.
