Gametophytic apomixis is a common form of asexual reproduction in plants. Virtually all gametophytic apomicts are polyploids, and 
some view polyploidy as a prerequisite for the transition to apomixis. However, any causal link between apomixis and polyploidy is 
complicated by the fact that most apomictic polyploids are allopolyploids, leading some to speculate that hybridization, rather than 
polyploidy, enables apomixis. Diploid apomixis presents a rare opportunity to isolate the role of hybridization, and a number of 
diploid apomicts have been documented in the genus Boechera (Brassicaceae). Here, we present the results of a microsatellite study 
of 1393 morphologically and geographically diverse diploid individuals, evaluating the hypothesis that diploid Boechera apomicts 
are hybrids. This genus-wide dataset wasmade possible by the applicability of a core set ofmicrosatellite loci in 69 of the 70 diploid 
Boechera species and by our ability to successfully genotype herbarium specimens of widely varying ages. With few exceptions, 
diploid apomicts exhibited markedly high levels of heterozygosity resulting from the combination of disparate genomes. This 
strongly suggests that most apomictic diploid Boechera lineages are of hybrid origin, and that the genomic consequences of 
hybridization allow for the transition to gametophytic apomixis in this genus. 
KEY WORDS: Apomixis, “genomic-collision,” heterozygosity, microsatellites, polyploidy. 
Sexual reproduction is a pervasive feature of biodiversity, and 
its preponderance over asexual alternatives is a longstanding 
evolutionary puzzle (Maynard Smith 1978; Bell 1982; Judson 
and Normark 1996; but see Gorelick and Heng 2010). Knowledge 
of the factors limiting asexuality therefore have clear implications 
for our understanding of the success of sexuality. 
In seed plants, asexuality includes both vegetative reproduction 
(Silvertown 2008) and apomixis, here defined as the production of 
a seed without reductive meiosis and fertilization (Van Dijk 2003; 
Bicknell and Koltunow 2004). Two major types of apomixis are 
recognized among seed plants. In sporophytic apomixis, no game-

tophyte is formed and the embryo buds directly from the maternal 
sporophyte ovular tissue. In gametophytic apomixis, the embryo 
arises from a nonreduced female gametophyte. The formation 
of this nonreduced female gametophyte, a process referred to as 
apomeiosis, begins with a megaspore mother cell that produces a 
nonreduced megaspore via a single division in place of meiosis. 
This nonreduced megaspore gives rise to the nonreduced female 
gametophyte via mitosis. Gametophytic apomixis is by far the 
better studied of the two phenomena and has been documented in 
over 120 plant genera (Carman 1997). 
Although gametophytic apomixis (hereafter referred to simply 
as “apomixis”) can be found in most major flowering plant 
lineages (Mogie 1992; Carman 1997), its distribution is highly 
nonrandom with respect to the mating system of close relatives,

geographic range, perenniality, ploidy, and hybridity (Bicknell 
and Koltunow 2004). The links between apomixis and polyploidy/
hybridization are particularly strong. The vast majority 
of apomictic plant species are polyploids (Richards 1997; Van 
Dijk 2003; Whitton et al. 2008), and a number of evolutionary 
scenarios have been put forth to explain this association (reviewed 
in Roche et al. 2001; Whitton et al. 2008). One model posits that a 
mutation causing a high frequency of unreduced gametes, leading 
to incrementally higher levels of ploidy, would result in selection 
for apomixis to avoid genomic obesity (Whitton et al. 2008). 
Another model suggests that the genetic determinant of apomixis 
itself could be tightly linked to a recessive lethal factor, one which 
would be fatal in a haploid gametophyte but masked in the higher 
ploidy gametophytes of polyploids (Richards 1997). 
Ultimately, any causal link between apomixis and polyploidy 
is complicated by the fact that most apomictic polyploids are allopolyploids, 
formed via hybridization between genetically divergent 
diploid species (White 1978; Kearney 2005). This has led 
some to speculate that hybridization, rather than polyploidy, is the 
primary cause of apomixis (Ernst 1918; Mogie 1992; Koltunow 
and Grossniklaus 2003). Apomixis may help hybrids overcome 
one of the primary challenges of combining disparate genomes, 
ensuring balanced chromosomal and genic segregation in their 
offspring. Alternatively, apomixis could be a consequence of hybridization, 
a direct result of novel epigenetic changes in gene 
regulation and/or the asynchronous expression of the two highly 
differentiated genomes present (Carman 1997, 2001; Koltunow 
and Grossniklaus 2003; Kantama et al. 2007). 
Two situations would allow isolation of the potential roles of 
polyploidy and hybridization in apomixis. One involves the study 
of apomictic autopolyploids, or polyploids not formed via interspecific 
hybridization. The other involves apomictic diploids. The 
rarity of the latter category is especially striking, and evidence for 
naturally occurring diploid apomicts exists for only a handful of 
plant taxa (Boechera sp.—references below; Hierochloe australis 
Roem.&Schult.—Weimarck 1967; Panicum sp.—Narayan 1962; 
Paspalum rufum Nees ex Steud.—Siena et al. 2008; Themeda 
australis Stapf—Evans and Knox 1969; Potentilla argentea L.— 
M¨untzing 1931 but see Holm and Ghatnekar 1996; Holm et al. 
1997). Most of these reports are of facultative apomixis observed 
in one or a few samples, and little is known about the frequency or 
relative performance of seeds derived via the apomictic pathway. 
Only in the genus Boechera A´ . Lo¨ve & D. Lo¨ve (Brassicaceae; 
formerly part of Arabis) is diploid apomixis common and 
well documented. The phylogenetic position of this genus near the 
model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. has generated 
considerable interest in Boechera asexuality (reviewed in Dobe.s 
et al. 2006). Diploid apomixiswas first reported in this group from 
plants originally identified as Arabis holboellii Hornem. (B¨ocher 
1951). Recent studies employing a broad range of techniques 
have identified diploid apomicts in seven additional species (Roy 
1995; Roy and Rieseberg 1989; Naumova et al. 2001; Schranz 
et al. 2005) and provided insights into the reproductive mechanisms 
(Taskin et al. 2004, 2009; Aliyu et al. 2010) and genetic 
control of Boechera apomixis (Schranz et al. 2006; Kantama 
et al. 2007; Sharbel et al. 2009, 2010). Allele profiles and 
genome painting in one of these diploid apomicts suggested that 
it was a hybrid between two sexual diploids (Dobe.s et al. 2004; 
Kantama et al. 2007), and recent studies have demonstrated radical 
changes in gene expression during apomictic ovule development 
in this hybrid (Sharbel et al. 2009, 2010). These results support 
a growing consensus (Schranz et al. 2005; Kantama et al. 2007; 
Aliyu et al. 2010; Sharbel et al. 2010) that apomixis in Boechera 
is the result of a cascade of gene regulatory changes following interspecific 
hybridization (Comai et al. 2003; Hegarty et al. 2008; 
Chelaifa et al. 2010). 
Although these studies suggest a general link between hybridization 
and apomixis, they are based on a tiny fraction of 
Boechera species diversity. There are approximately 70 diploid 
Boechera species (Windham and Al-Shehbaz 2006), and the genetics 
and/or sexuality of the vast majority of these species remains 
unknown. A broad survey of diploid Boechera would allow 
for a rigorous evaluation of the relationship between apomixis 
and hybridization. In this study, we first establish the frequency 
of Boechera diploid hybrids by identifying individuals exhibiting 
a genomic signature of hybridization based on genome-wide heterozygosity. 
Apomixis, as inferred from apomeiotic pollen morphology, 
is then assessed. The general co-occurrence of a hybrid 
background with apomixis in Boechera would provide strong evidence 
of a functional link between these phenomena in plants. 
Materials and Methods 
SAMPLING 
A total of 2022 Boechera individuals were sampled as part of a 
larger study aimed at genus-wide diploid species delimitation. Our 
sampling design relied heavily on existing biodiversity resources, 
with ca. 75% of the samples taken from specimens housed in 
35 North American herbaria. Samples were chosen to provide 
broad geographic sampling of as many diploid species as possible. 
A smaller number of known triploids and tetraploids were included 
for comparison. Special emphasis was placed on sampling 
voucher specimens for published and unpublished chromosome 
counts. Previous chromosome counts and those done during the 
course of this study were correlated with the maximum number of 
alleles per microsatellite locus to estimate ploidy for all specimens 
(see “determining ploidy level” below). 
DNA EXTRACTION AND GENOTYPING 
A total of 1734 of the 2022 samples used in the study were 
extracted using a modified version of the CTAB protocol 
986 EVOLUTION APRIL 2012

ASEXUALITY AND HYBRIDIZATION IN DIPLOID BOECHERA 
(Doyle and Dickson 1987). The primary modification involved 
the use of paired 96-well racks of 1.1 mL tubes, allowing 
192 samples to be extracted over parts of three days. The 
full protocol has been archived on the Dryad database: 
doi:10.5061/dryad.11p/757m0. The remaining samples were extracted 
using either Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kits (Qiagen, 
Germantown, MD) or the modified miniprep protocol described 
in Alexander et al. (2007). Microsatellite allele variation was assessed 
at 13 previously published loci (ICE3, ICE14—Clauss 
et al. 2002; a1, b6, c8, e9—Dobe.s et al. 2004; BF3, BF11, 
BF15, BF18, BF9, BF20, Bdru266—Song et al. 2006). Forward 
primers for each locus were labeled with 6-FAM or 
HEX. Sets of two or three loci were simultaneously amplified 
using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol. 
Each 8 µl reaction contained 2.5 µl 2× Qiagen Multiplex 
PCR Master mix, 0.2 µM each primer, and approx. 
20 ng DNA template. Reactions involved denaturing at 95.C 
(15 min), 30 cycles of 94.C denaturing (30 s), 53.C annealing 
(90 s), and 72.C extension (60 s), followed by a final extension 
step at 60.C (30 min). Amplicons were sized using the 500 ROX 
standard on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer. Alleles 
were determined using GeneMarker 1.9 (SoftGenetics, State 
College, PA). 
DETERMINING PLOIDY LEVEL 
To construct a dataset composed entirely of diploids, the maximum 
number of microsatellite alleles per locus was used to estimate 
ploidy level for all samples. Individuals with a maximum 
of two alleles at all 13 loci were inferred to be diploids, individuals 
with three alleles at any locus were considered triploids, 
and individuals with four alleles at any locus as tetraploids. The 
accuracy of this approach was evaluated by comparing predicted 
ploidy levels to known chromosome numbers in the 342 specimens 
for which chromosome counts were available. This approach 
correctly estimated ploidy in 330 (96%) of these samples, 
and only three higher ploidy samples were misdiagnosed as 
diploids. Each of these mismatches involved voucher specimens 
from previously published chromosome counts in which more 
than one plant was present on the herbarium sheet, with no indication 
which of the plants actually provided the chromosome 
material. Of the 1587 individuals inferred to be diploid based 
on maximum allele number, 1393 (88%) exhibited missing data 
at no more than one locus. These 1393 individuals (see Dryad 
database doi:10.5061/dryad.11p757m0) were subjected to further 
analysis. 
ASSESSING REPRODUCTIVE MODE 
We inferred male apomeiosis in a subset of diploid samples 
by examining pollen morphology. Mature Boechera pollen typically 
falls into three phenotypic classes: (1) small, malformed 
grains; (2) larger, ellipsoid grains with symmetric colpi; and 
(3) even larger, spheroid or triangular grains with asymmetric 
colpi. Chromosome analyses of 134 plants included in the larger 
microsatellite study (M. D. Windham et al. unpubl. data) reveal 
a very strong correlation between these pollen morphologies and 
the type of meiosis observed, as has been reported in several previous 
studies (Koch et al. 2003; Sharbel et al. 2005; Windham 
and Al-Shehbaz 2006). The smallest, misshapen grains are the 
products of irregular meiotic events, whereas the ellipsoid grains 
and the spheroid/triangular grains result from normal meiosis 
and apomeiosis, respectively. The presence of spheroid/triangular 
pollen grains in an individual, even at low frequency, provides a 
priori evidence that the plant is attempting to reproduce through 
apomixis. To assess the prevalence ofmale apomeiosis, pollenwas 
removed from individual specimens included in the microsatellite 
analyses. Our choice of individuals was guided by ongoing 
studies of certain widespread diploid species and by our intent 
to include pollen from individuals representing the full range of 
Boechera heterozygosity (see below). Pollen (frommultiple flowers 
whenever possible) was removed, mounted in glycerol, and 
immediately examined at 400× magnification on a Zeiss Axioplan 
2 microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). A 
qualitative assessment of the total pollen pool was made, noting 
primary and (if present) secondary and tertiary pollen types. 
CORRELATING HYBRIDIZATION AND APOMIXIS 
The connection between hybridization and apomixis in diploid 
Boechera was assessed by comparing reproductive mode (inferred 
from pollen morphology) to observed heterozygosity at 13 
microsatellite loci. Previous studies have demonstrated that sexual 
diploid Boechera species are generally self-compatible and 
highly homozygous (Song et al. 2006; Song and Mitchell-Olds 
2007). If apomixis and hybridity are tightly associated, we would 
expect high levels of heterozygosity in diploid apomicts, because 
they combine two divergent sexual diploid genomes. In addition, 
unlike sexual hybrids that can exhibit reduced levels of heterozygosity 
through subsequent self-fertilization, asexual lineages have 
little opportunity to purge initial heterozygosity. 
HYBRID TEST CASES 
Two apomictic diploid taxa were examined in detail. Each was 
shown to be diploid based on chromosome counts and allele 
number per locus, and each exhibited both apomictic pollen and 
high heterozygosity. Both have “modified malpighiaceous” trichomes 
(subsessile and asymmetrically three-rayed) indicative of 
a hybrid origin involving Boechera stricta (Graham) Al-Shehbaz 
(Windham and Al-Shehbaz 2007b). Although the two taxa in 
question clearly share a B. stricta parentage, they are otherwise 
quite distinct morphologically. This suggests that they differ 
with regard to their second sexual diploid parent and that these

unknown parents belong to different species. Comparisons of the 
alleles present in both hybrids to those of the 69 sexual diploid 
species included in our totalmicrosatellite analysis confirmed this 
hypothesis. Both hybrids exhibited alleles diagnostic for B. stricta 
at all or most of the 13 microsatellite loci. For one hybrid taxon, 
the non-B. stricta alleles at each locus matched those found in 
sexual diploid B. retrofracta (Graham) A´ . Lo¨ve & D. Lo¨ve. In the 
other case, the non-B. stricta alleles matched those found in B. 
fendleri (S. Watson) W. A. Weber. These hybrid hypotheses are 
fully congruent with morphology and the two taxa hereafter will 
be referred to as “RS” (B. retrofracta × B. stricta) and “FS” (B. 
fendleri × B. stricta). 
The veracity of each hybrid hypothesis was evaluated by 
comparing the “hybrid index” and the “percent alleles explained” 
of RS and FS to those of several morphologically plausible alternative 
parental combinations. The hybrid index (Buerkle 2005, 
implemented in GenoDive 2.0—Meirmans and Van Tienderen 
2004) is a maximum-likelihood estimate of the proportion of alleles 
in a hybrid individual that were contributed by a putative 
parent given a second putative parent. The pair exhibiting a hybrid 
index closest to a hypothetical 50% contribution from each 
parent was considered the best fit, since a 50/50 parental ratio 
would be expected in an apomeiotic hybrid. “Percent alleles explained” 
is a straightforward measure of the proportion of alleles 
present in a group of hybrid individuals that are also present in 
the pooled samples of a parental pair. Finally, to visualize the 
relative position of the samples of each hybrid to their optimal 
parental pair, hybrid and parental samples were subjected to a 
principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) in GenAlEx 6.0 (Peakall 
and Smouse 2006) using a standardized covariance matrix derived 
from the codominant genotypic genetic distance (Smouse 
and Peakall 1999). 
Results 
GENOTYPING SUCCESS 
We successfully amplified the chosen set ofmicrosatellite primers 
across the full range of Boechera species. Full 13-locus data were 
obtained for 73% of the 2022 samples, and an additional 16% were 
missing data at a single locus. We were also able to successfully 
genotype from herbarium specimens of a dramatic age range. The 
relationship between specimen age and genotyping success for the 
1045 herbarium specimens collected between 1881 and 1999 is 
shown in Figure 1. The relationship was significant (r2 = 0.055, 
P < 1.3 × 10-14) but weak, and many of the older specimens 
yielded full data, including 26 specimens from the 1800s for 
which we were able to genotype at least 12 of the 13 loci. 
HETEROZYGOSITY AND APOMIXIS 
The maximum allele number approach identified 1587 diploids, 
and 1393 (88%) of these exhibited missing data at no more than 
one locus. The full 1393 sample by 13-locus dataset has been 
archived on the Dryad database: doi:10.5061/dryad.11p757m0.

The majority of samples (54%) were either completely homozygous 
or heterozygous at a single locus. Examples of 
the array of heterozygosity within species are shown in 
Figure 3. Most sexual diploid species were dominated by 
completely homozygous individuals (Fig. 3A–G), whereas a 
small number of species comprise no completely homozygous 
individuals (Fig. 3H–I). 
Pollen morphology was determined for 273 individuals 
(see Dryad database doi:10.5061/dryad.11p757m0). There 
was a clear relationship between heterozygosity and male 
apomeiosis. Figure 2B illustrates the distribution of the 
191 “sexual” individuals—those with sexual pollen only, 
or where sexual pollen was mixed with irregular (but not 
apomictic) pollen. Figure 2C illustrates the distribution of 
the 82 “apomictic” individuals—those with any apomictic 
pollen, either exclusively apomictic, or mixed with irregular 
and/or sexual pollen. Although sexual individuals exhibited a 
range of heterozygosity, apomictic individuals were essentially all 
highly heterozygous. Mean heterozygosity is significantly higher 
in the apomictic samples (mean 9.40) relative to the sexual samples 
(mean 3.02) (Mann–Whitney U, U = 13,860.5, P < 2.2 
× 10-16), a contrast that becomes stronger when samples with 
apomictic pollen as the primary component (mean 10.02) are 
compared to those with sexual pollen as the primary component 
(mean 2.12). 
HYBRID TEST CASES 
Ten hypothesized B. fendleri × B. stricta (FS) apomictic hybrids 
were identified, all of which were heterozygous at 11 or 12 of the 
13 loci. Pollen morphology was examined for all 10 specimens, 
and apomictic pollen was identified in each case. As explained 
earlier, B. stricta is strongly supported as one of the parents of 
the FS apomictic diploids. Four species, all belonging to the B. 
fendleri species group (P. J. Alexander et al., unpubl. ms.), were 
considered as the potential second parent: B. fendleri, B. gracilipes 
(Greene) Dorn, B. pendulina (Greene) W. A. Weber, and 
B. spatifolia (Rydberg)Windham & Al-Shehbaz. The selection of 
B. fendleri as the second parent both maximized the percentage 
of hybrid alleles explained and resulted in a hybrid index score 
closest to 0.5 (Table 1). 
Five hypothesized B. retrofracta × B. stricta (RS) hybrids 
were identified, all but one of whichwere heterozygous at 11 or 12 
of the 13 loci. Pollen morphology was examined for all five specimens, 
and apomictic pollen was identified in four cases, with the 
remaining sample exhibiting only irregular pollen. In addition to 
the known parent (B. stricta), six other species were considered 
as potential parents of the RS apomictic diploids: B. collinsii 
(Fernald) A´ . Lo¨ve & D. Lo¨ve, B. pendulocarpa (A. Nelson) 
Windham & Al-Shehbaz, B. polyantha (Greene) Windham & 
Al-Shehbaz, B. pulchra (M. E. Jones ex S.Watson)W. A.Weber, 
B. rectissima (Greene) Al-Shehbaz, and B. retrofracta. The selection 
of B. retrofracta as the second parent both maximizes 
the percentage of hybrid alleles explained and results in a hybrid 
index score closest to 0.5 (Table 1). The PCoA results (Fig. 4) indicate 
that both FS and RS are coherent genetic groups of highly

Discussion 
GENOTYPING SUCCESS ACROSS SPECIES AND TIME 
Our results indicate that the microsatellite loci used in this study 
can be genotyped in any Boechera species, with high-quality data 
obtainable from herbarium specimens collected as far back as 
130 years ago. There were few clear cases of species-specific 
null alleles, which is impressive considering that the 13 loci were 
originally designed from only two Boechera species—B. stricta 
and B. fecunda (Rollins) Dorn—and A. thaliana (L.) Henyh. 
These results join a growing number of studies indicating that 
microsatellites designed for one species can often be broadly amplified 
in related species (Barbar´a et al. 2007; Ochieng et al. 2007;

Shaw et al. 2008; Skrede et al. 2009; Zgurski et al. 2009). The 
ability to transfer such loci to additional species has been related 
to divergence time, and in Boechera, the broad applicability of 
these loci is likely a byproduct of the shallow genetic divergence 
among species revealed by a recent 10-locus phylogeny of the 
genus (P. J. Alexander et al., unpubl. ms.). In such cases, the 
limited genetic divergence among lineages could turn out to be 
an asset in comparative studies, allowing for the genotyping of 
highly variable microsatellite loci across lineages. 
Specimen age had relatively little effect in our study 
(Fig. 1), and genotyping microsatellites is likely to be more feasible 
than standard DNA sequencing in older herbarium specimens. 
DNAextracted frommuseummaterial is often highly fragmented, 
making it more difficult to amplify larger sections (Rogers and 
Bendich 1985; P¨a¨abo 1989). Many DNA regions that are commonly 
used in sequencing studies are >400 bp in length, whereas 
most microsatellite regions are between 80 and 300 bp. Taken 
together, the applicability of microsatellites to a broad range of 
taxa and specimens could open the door for a variety of rigorous 
comparative studies in complex, species-rich groups. 
MALE APOMEIOSIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH 
HETEROZYGOSITY 
The bimodal distribution of heterozygosity (Fig. 2A) observed 
among diploid individuals provides important insights into breeding 
system and sexuality in Boechera. The majority (54%) of 
diploid samples were either completely homozygous or heterozygous 
at a single locus. This low level of heterozygosity is consistent 
with previous molecular studies of B. stricta (Roy 1995; 
Song et al. 2006), B. crandallii (B. L. Robinson) W. A. Weber

(Roy 1995), and B. fecunda (Song and Mitchell-Olds 2007), 
which indicated that self-fertilization is common (and perhaps 
predominant) among the sexual species of the genus. Apparent 
exceptions in our dataset include a small number of sexual 
diploid species with elevated levels of heterozygosity (Fig. 3H, 
I). Interestingly, these species exhibit phenotypes typically associated 
with outcrossing, including large, showy flowers and, in the 
case of B. parishii, long styles and exerted anthers. These likely 
outcrossing taxa are intriguing anomalies in a genus otherwise 
dominated by self-fertilization and asexuality. 
In addition to the prominent peak composed of low heterozygosity 
sexual diploids, Figure 2A reveals a second peak consisting 
of plants that were heterozygous at seven to 12 loci. This peak 
encompasses a diversity of individuals that appear to combine 
alleles from two morphologically distinctive, low heterozygosity 
species. The two hybrid test cases (FS and RS) exemplify the 
digenomic makeup typical of these highly heterozygous taxa. FS 
individuals exhibited a hybrid index only 2% removed from a 
50/50 genomic contribution from each parent (B. fendleri × B. 
stricta, Table 1). The hybrid index for RS deviated just 3% from 
the 50/50 parental ratio (B. retrofracta × B. stricta, Table 1). 
These hybrids also formed cohesive genetic clusters intermediate 
between their parents in the PCoA ordination (Fig. 4). Not only 
are FS and RS diploid hybrids, their pollen phenotypes clearly 
indicate that they are apomictic hybrids. Pollen was examined for 
all 15 FS/RS individuals, and in all but one case, apomictic pollen 
was observed—with the single exception of an RS individual that 
exhibited exclusively irregular pollen. This is in stark contrast to 
their low heterozygosity parents, which rarely show any evidence 
of male apomeiosis. Finally, the proposed status of FS and RS is 
plausible in a geographic context, given that both hybrids typically 
occur where the ranges of their putative parents overlap or 
come into close contact (Fig. 5). 
The highly heterozygous and apomictic FS and RS individuals 
are part of a larger trend that extends to the entire dataset. 
With fewexceptions, pollen indicative ofmale apomeiosiswas restricted 
to individuals heterozygous at seven or more microsatellite 
loci (Fig. 2C). Importantly, this relationship between heterozygosity 
and apomixis would likely be even stronger if female 
apomeiosis had been assessed. The formation of an unreduced embryo 
sac is an operative step in apomixis, and can take place with 
or without the formation of an unreduced pollen grain in Boechera 
(Kantama et al. 2007; Aliyu et al. 2010). This is perhaps best illustrated 
by B. microphylla (Nuttall) Dorn, a widespread species that 
displays high levels of heterozygosity (mean 8.6 loci) throughout 
its range. Although this species is a documented apomict based 
on studies of embryo sac development (J. Carman, pers. comm.), 
none of the 19 B. microphylla specimens examined in this study 
exhibited apomictic pollen as the primary component, and only 
four samples exhibited apomictic pollen as a minor component.

The fact that sexual pollen is commonly encountered in diploid 
apomicts such as B. microphylla could explain our pollen-based 
inference of sexuality in several highly heterozygous individuals 
(Fig. 2B). 
HYBRIDIZATION AND APOMIXIS IN BOECHERA 
The observation that diploid apomixis is associated with elevated 
heterozygosity suggests that the interaction of divergent genomes 
within a hybrid individual may enable the transition from sexuality 
to asexuality in Boechera. However, an alternative explanation 
reverses this causative relationship and posits that, with 
time, apomixis itself leads to high levels of heterozygosity. When 
a lineage becomes asexual, the initial level of heterozygosity is 
largely static due to a lack of recombination. The only change 
would be due to mutation at a homozygous locus, increasing 
overall heterozygosity. With time, heterozygosity would ratchet 
upwards—the so-called “Meselson Effect” (Birky 1996; Judson 
and Normark 1996;Welch and Meselson 2000). This effect, however, 
requires sufficient time for such mutations to accumulate, 
and most asexual lineages are thought to be short lived (Wagner 
1970; Whitton et al. 2008; Beck et al. 2011). Indeed, few clear 
empirical demonstrations of the Meselson effect exist (Schurko 
et al. 2008), often because hybridization is a likely source of the 
observed elevated heterozygosity (Delmotte et al. 2003; Johnson 
and Johnson 2006; Lunt 2008; Corral et al. 2009). In Boechera, 
there is clear evidence for the hybrid origin of the highly heterozygous 
apomicts FS and RS, a pattern that extends to most, if not all, 
of the diploid apomict samples in our dataset. In addition, a recent 
fossil-based dating of the Brassicaceae phylogeny indicated that 
the Boechera stem group originated ca. 4 MYa (Beilstein et al. 
2010). The Boechera crown group is likely considerably younger, 
a seemingly short time frame for the mutational accumulation 
hypothesized by the Meselson Effect. 
The link between hybridization and apomixis highlighted in 
this study contributes to a growing consensus that the genetic 
consequences of interspecific gene flow, so called “genomic collisions” 
(Carman 2001) are involved in the transition to apomixis 
in Boechera. Several studies have identified major changes to 
both genome structure and gene expression in diploid Boechera 
hybrids. Cytological study of an apomictic diploid hybrid referred 
to as “B. divaricarpa” revealed that hybridizationwas followed by 
significant structural changes in the genome, including homeologous 
chromosome substitutions and aneuploidy (Kantama et al. 
2007). Two recent large-scale analyses highlighted major differences 
in gene expression during ovule development in sexual 
versus apomictic diploid individuals of Boechera (Sharbel et al. 
2009, 2010). In particular, these studies found that global patterns 
of gene regulation were down-regulated during the early 
stages of apomictic ovule development and up-regulated during 
later stages.Anumber of these differentially expressed genes were 
transcription factors, leading the authors to hypothesize that largescale 
regulatory changes brought about by hybridization played 
an important role in the transition to apomixis (Sharbel et al. 
2010). Sexual diploid species of Boechera typically exhibit very 
little heterozygosity (Figs. 2A, 3) and are genetically divergent 
at the neutral loci examined here (data not shown). If this divergence 
extends to regulatory genes, apomixis could result from 
novel patterns of gene expression created by combining divergent 
transcriptional regulators (Carman 1997, 2001). 
Rather than arising from one or a few successful hybrid combinations, 
the diploid apomicts in Boechera representmany different 
combinations of sexual species spanning the genetic diversity 
of the genus (Fig. 6). This capacity for interspecific hybridization 
is a major source of lineage diversity in the genus.Morphological 
intermediates are frequently observed in the field and in herbarium 
collections (Rollins 1983; Al-Shehbaz et al. 2006; Windham 
EVOLUTION APRIL 2012 993

JAMES B. BECK ET AL. 
and Al-Shehbaz 2007a,b), andWindham and Al-Shehbaz (2007b) 
estimate that there are “literally hundreds” of distinct hybrids in 
Boechera, most of which have not been formally named. Schranz 
et al. (2005) successfully crossed 18 Boechera species to B. stricta, 
and previous studies have confirmed the existence of a variety of 
naturally occurring hybrids for which B. stricta was a hypothesized 
parent (Dobe.s et al. 2004; Kantama et al. 2007). Future 
experimental work could expand upon these studies by identifying 
parental genomic combinations that did not lead to apomixis 
and/or variation in the timing of the apomictic transition itself. Is 
apomixis typically observed in F1 progeny, or do diploid hybrids 
undergo generations of self-fertilization or backcrossing before 
becoming apomictic? Are either of these patterns related to phylogenetic 
distance between the parental species? The emerging 
picture of Boechera evolution is one of a diverse set of sexual 
diploid species giving rise to countless diploid and polyploid 
apomictic lineages through genus-wide hybridization, and it is 
this taxonomic, cytological, ecological, and sexual diversity that 
sets it apart as an ideal model system for this and other ongoing 
research into plant diversification and life-history evolution.
