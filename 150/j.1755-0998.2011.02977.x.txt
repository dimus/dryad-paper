Abstract
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have potential for broad application in population and conservation genetics, but availability of these markers is limited in many nonmodel species. In this study, genomic and expressed sequence tagged (EST) sequences from closely related salmonids (Chinook salmon and rainbow trout) were used to design primers for amplification and sequencing of sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon DNA for SNP discovery. One hundred and six primer sets were designed and tested for amplification in each species. An ascertainment panel of 32 diverse individuals from each species was used as template for PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. In total, 21 647 bases of consensus sequence were screened in sockeye salmon and 20 784 bases in coho salmon with 93 and 149 SNP sites identified, respectively. Sixty-four SNP sites were chosen for assay development, and 54 of the assays were validated by comparison with genotype and sequence data (O. nerka = 23; O. kisutch = 31). These validated SNP assays along with 142 other available SNP assays [O. nerka = 103 (126 total); O. kisutch = 30 (61 total)] were used to genotype collections of O. nerka (N = 5) and O. kisutch (N = 4) from various sites in the Columbia River to evaluate the utility of these markers in this region. Results from factorial correspondence analysis indicate that these SNP markers are capable of distinguishing O. nerka populations, but O. kisutch collections were less distinct because of their common ancestry.

Introduction
Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based markers are being used with more frequency for genetic studies of Pacific salmonids for genetic stock identification (e.g., Habicht et al. 2010), as quantitative trait loci (QTL) or candidate loci under selection (e.g., Narum et al. 2010) and parentage studies (e.g., Anderson & Garza 2006). The majority of developed markers for salmonids, however, target only two species: rainbow trout ⁄ steelhead (O. mykiss), which is supported by the aquaculture industry, and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), a popular sport and commercial fish. A smaller pool of SNP markers are currently available for chum salmon (Smith et al. 2005a,c) with the remaining four species of Pacific salmon still lacking a suitable pool of available SNP markers to conduct similar types of studies. However, successful imple-

mentation of SNP markers in other species has sparked new efforts in SNP discovery and assay development in species of lesser economic interest.
Sockeye and coho salmon are two species with both economic and conservation interests in the Columbia River basin. These species were largely extirpated from the inland portion of the basin by overharvest, habitat destruction and the construction of dams hindering upstream migration (Gustafson et al. 2007). Upstream populations of the obligatorily anadromous coho salmon were exhausted completely, while some successful passage of the earlier running sockeye salmon persisted and some fish may have found refuge in reservoirs as resident forms of Oncorhynchus nerka commonly called kokanee (Taylor et al. 1996). Efforts to re-establish naturally spawning upriver coho salmon using lower Columbia River broodstock have been ongoing since the mid 1990s in the Yakima and Wenatchee rivers (Bosch et al. 2007). Genetic differentiation using microsatellite data has shown weak structure in coho salmon collections but

relatively stronger structure in sockeye salmon collections within the Columbia River (Beacham et al. 2006; Van Doornik et al. 2007).
In this study, 106 primer sets based on Genbank and TIGR sequences were designed and tested for amplification of sockeye and coho salmon DNA. Primer sets that amplified a clean PCR product were used to amplify and sequence DNA from an ascertainment panel of 32 individuals from across each species’ natural range. Our samples were chosen to include much of the genetic diversity existing within each species so as to avoid ascertainment bias (e.g. Morin et al. 2004). Validated assays from this study were evaluated by minor allele frequency, genetic differentiation (GST), Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), statistically significant linkage disequilibrium and the quality of the genotyping plots. These assays along with 133 other available SNP markers (coho = 30; sockeye = 103) were subsequently used to genotype multiple collections of each species from the Columbia River basin to evaluate their ability to distinguish populations in this region.
Methods
DNA sequences from O. mykiss and O. tshawytscha were collected from online database entries in TIGR and NCBI for primer design. Primers were designed using either the embedded primer design tool on NCBI’s database or the Primer3 program (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/) to amplify a PCR product of 400–800 bp in length. All primer pairs (N = 106) were tested for amplification of a PCR product suitable for sequencing using 2 uL of extract DNA from two individuals per species. PCR conditions for testing amplification were 1· Qiagen multiplex master mix, 250 nM primers and 1–2 uL of extract DNA in a 10-uL reaction. PCR amplification was conducted in 96-well PCR plates, and thermal cycling conditions were [95 °C for 15 min; (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, repeated 40 cycles); 4 °C hold]. Amplified products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with Sybr-green (Invitrogen). Products were visualized using a UV light source, and images were captured on a CCD camera. Primer pairs that produced a suitable product were used to amplify DNA from an ascertainment panel of 32 individuals per species. Individuals chosen for the ascertainment panel were from across each species’ range but with the greatest representation within the Columbia River drainage (Table 1).
For amplification of the ascertainment samples, primers were multiplexed such that each reaction produced four products. PCR and cycling conditions remained the same as in the initial amplification test. PCR products were cleaned by treatment with exonuclease 1 and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) to
Molecular Ecology Resources (2011) 11 (Suppl. 1), 20–30 Ó 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd
remove unincorporated dNTPs and primers. Sequencing reactions were performed in one direction using the Big Dye v.1.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and MJ research and Applied Biosystems thermal cyclers using 2 uL of each product. The reactions were cleaned up by ethanol–EDTA–NaAcetate precipitation prior to separation by capillary electrophoresis using a 3730 instrument (Applied Biosystems). Chromatogram data were analysed with Sequencing Analysis v.5.4 (Applied Biosystems), and Sequencher v.4.7 (Gene Codes) was used to align and edit the data. Observed SNPs and small indels were recorded and minor allele frequencies calculated for each. Primer sets that produced sequence data were submitted to Genbank along with the resulting sequence data (GenBank numbers GF109770–GF109881). SNP sites and small indels were submitted to dbSNP. Sequence alignment files are available at the Dryad data repository (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8029).
Suitable SNP sites were used to design TaqmanÔ assays by submitting to Applied Biosystems via their FILE BUILDER program. Once received, the assays were used for genotyping using the Fluidigm EP-1 96.96 system using the manufacturer’s suggested protocol, but modified slightly by including a sample preamplification step and increasing the PCR cycles to 50. The assays were validated by comparison with genotyping data to sequencing data in the ascertainment samples. Validated assays are shown in Table 2.
Evaluation of newly developed SNP assays along with all other available assays (N = 126 for O. nerka; N = 61 for Oncorhynchus kisutch) was conducted by genotyping five collections of O. nerka and four collections of O. kisutch within the Columbia River drainage to examine allele frequencies, deviations from HWE expectations and statistically significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) using the program GENEPOP (Raymond & Rousset 1995) (Table 3). Genotype data were loaded to the Dryad data repository (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8029). Assays that produced poor-quality assay plots or were significant in tests of HWE or LD were removed from further testing. The program GENETIX (Belkhir et al. 2004) was used to calculate GST and evaluate genetic differentiation by factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) (Fig. 1). The program ONCOR (http://www.montana.edu/ kalinowski/Software/ONCOR.htm) was used to simulate 200 individual genotypes based on observed allele frequencies and assign them to a collection (100 iterations) to determine the percentage of correct assignment (Table 4).
Results
For the O. nerka ascertainment panel, 80 loci were amplified and sequenced, of which 57 produced usable

 sequence alignments totalling 21 647 unique bases with an average contig length of 380 bases. Ninety-three total SNP sites were identified in 41 sequence alignments with 17 sequence alignments showing no polymorphisms within the ascertainment sequences. Twenty-nine SNP sites were chosen for assay design based on minor allele frequency and distribution within the ascertainment panel. Twenty-three of the assays were validated by comparison with the ascertainment sample genotypes with sequencing data (Table 2). These 23 assays were then evaluated further along with 103 other available assays for O. nerka (Table 3). A single assay showed significant heterozygote deficiency across populations (One_ UCA-24; P = 0.0024). Eight assays showed significant heterozygote excess across populations (One_fn-297; P = 0.0000); (One_HGFA-49; P = 0.0000); (One_NNT; P = 0.0000); (One_spf30-207; P = 0.0000); (One_timp2-63; P = 0.0000); (One_U1021-57; P = 0.0000); (One_U301-92; P = 0.0000) and (One_ing4-57; P = 0.0024). Eleven of the
assays showed fixed genotypes across all collections from the Columbia River. Strong signals of linkage disequilibrium (P £ 0.002) were observed between seven pairs of loci (One_aldB-152 and One_ALDOB-135; P = 0.00000); (One_Cytb-17 and One_Cytb-26; P = 0.000000); (One_ GPH-414 and One_GTHa; P = 0.00000); (One_MHC2-190 and One_pax7-248; P = 0.00000); (One_ODC1-196 and One_U508-533 P = 0.00000); (One_U1201-492 and One_ zP3b; P = 0.00081); and (One_hsc71-220 and One_U1201492; P = 0.00174). Two of these linked pairs were known to be from the same genes (aldolase B, cytochrome b), and the two markers within the major histocompatibility complex 2 gene cluster (One_MHC2-190 and One_MHC2-251) showed statistically weaker linkage disequilibrium (P = 0.00244). Average minor allele frequency across collections and GST are reported in Table 3. Each assay was also rated for quality of genotyping plots based on separation of the three possible clusters in three separate amplifications. The average plot

quality score was scaled from 0 to 1, with ratings of 0.0– 0.5 being poor, 0.51–0.7 intermediate and 0.71–1.0 good.
For the coho salmon SNP discovery effort, 83 loci were amplified and sequenced producing 53 sequence alignments totalling 20 784 unique consensus bases with an average contig length of approximately 392 bp. A total of 149 SNP sites were identified in 45 sequence alignments with eight alignments revealing no variation within the ascertainment sequences. SNP sites were chosen for assay design based on minor allele frequency and distribution of genotypes within the ascertainment panel. Of the 149 SNP sites, 35 were selected and submitted to Applied Biosystems for assay design. These assays were used to genotype the ascertainment panel and were validated by comparison with genotype and sequence data.

(Table 3). Five assays showed fixed genotypes across all collections from the Columbia River. One assay showed a heterozygote excess (Oki_afp4-10; P = 0.0075), and two assays showed heterozygote deficits (Oki_serpin-130; P = 0.0016 and Oki_TniUPP-230; P = 0.0322). Significant linkage disequilibrium was detected between three pairs of assays (Oki_U202-258 and Oki_U202-290 P = 0.00009); (Oki_ins-167 and Oki_ins-323; P = 0.00000) and (Oki_hsc713-56; Oki_hsc71p-313 P = 0.00336). All three of the linked assays were from the same gene, but alleles were only in complete phase between the two U202 markers. Similarly, there were several loci that were known to be physically linked but were not significant in tests for genotypic linkage disequilibrium. Table 3 shows the average minor allele frequency across collections and GST. The average plot quality score, described previously, is also reported for each assay.
Genotype data from 32 individuals from five Columbia River populations of O. nerka and four of O. kisutch were used to assess the ability of each set of SNP markers to differentiate collections. Thirteen SNP loci were removed from the data set for O. nerka and five for O. kisutch prior to this evaluation because of violations of HWE and statistically significant linkage disequilibrium. This resulted in genotype data for 113 and 56 SNP loci, respectively, for further analyses. The program ONCOR was used to simulate 200 individuals per collection from baseline allele frequencies and determine proportions based on 100% parametric values. Simulated individuals were assigned to a collection 100 times, and the percentage of correct assignments was recorded (Table 4). The program GENETIX was used to create XY scatter plots using relative chi-square distances from FCA for each individual of the two species. These data points were used to create the FCA plots in Fig. 1a (O.nerka) and 1b (O. kisutch). Using this set of 113 SNP loci, the collections of O. nerka were strongly differentiated as evidenced by high percentages of correct assignment and the well-defined FCA plot. Conversely, the collections of coho salmon were not well differentiated using the set of 56 SNP loci. However, there were less than half the number of SNP markers describing the differentiation in O. kisutch as in O. nerka, and only 41 markers in O. kisutch had minor allele frequencies over 10%.
Discussion
This SNP discovery effort used traditional Sanger sequencing of specific PCR products from target loci. This method has been used successfully by many Pacific salmonid researchers for SNP discovery to date (e.g., Smith et al. 2005a; Campbell et al. 2009). However, nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) methods such as pyrosequencing are beginning to be used more widely for SNP

discovery in salmonids. A recent such effort in O. mykiss (Sanchez et al. 2009) produced approximately 130K contigs with an average size of 259 bp and discovered about 22K putative SNP sites. However, the conversion of putative SNP sites to functional assays was very low (48%) compared to the conversion rate from this study (84%) because of the inability of NGS to differentiate true SNP sites from paralogous sequence variants and sequencing errors. Also, the sequences produced are largely from unknown regions of the genome (98%), whereas a targeted gene approach of ESTs using Sanger sequencing can capitalize on previous studies that often provide functional roles for certain genes. Sequencing of transcript DNA using NGS (i.e. Seeb et al. in press) yields only sequences from expressed genes within a given tissue type, but the data have an overrepresentation of highly expressed genes, and intron sequences are absent. However, exon enrichment techniques (Hodges et al. 2007) and whole genome assemblies for salmonids would remedy these drawbacks and make NGS a more attractive option for future SNP discovery projects.
Discovery of SNP sites suitable for assay design in these two species was more difficult than in similar discovery efforts with O. mykiss and O. tshawytscha (Campbell & Narum 2008; Campbell et al. 2009). The number of sequences with no observed polymorphisms was 29% in the O. nerka discovery panel and 17% in the O. kisutch panel. Comparatively, these percentages for O. mykiss and O. tshawytscha using largely the same sequenced loci were 3% and 7%, respectively, and higher densities of SNPs were discovered. Although this could simply be an effect of ascertainment bias, this seems unlikely as each ascertainment panel contained samples covering much of the species’ natural range. Therefore, it seems that there is simply less variation within these two species than O. mykiss and O. tshawytscha, and a greater number of sequenced loci will be required to deliver the same number of suitable SNP sites versus a species such as O. mykiss. These results corroborate previous studies describing the genetic diversity of salmonids using allozyme (Utter et al. 1973; Allendorf & Utter 1979) and microsatellite markers (Beacham et al. 2006; Van Doornik et al. 2007).
Several of the SNP markers tested showed strong statistical linkage disequilibrium with one another, while some that were known to be physically linked did not show statistically significant linkage disequilibrium when tested. Loci that are known to be physically linked but do not occur in phase with one another can be phased into a single locus using a program such as PHASE (Stephens & Donnelly 2003) or Arlequin (Excoffier et al. 2005) potentially creating a more highly informative locus with more than two alleles. Alternatively, Habicht etal. (2010) describe the use of linked markers

(One_MHC2-190 and One_MHC2-251) to create composite phenotypes, and mitochondrial markers (One_cytb-17 and One_cytb-26) were combined into composite haplotypes. Methods such as these can utilize the information in the genotypes of linked SNPs without overrepresenting a single locus in the genome. However, in cases where two or more markers are in complete phase with one another, it may be best to simply drop one of the markers for further analyses. Also, there were several loci that showed no variation within the collections tested (O. nerka = 11 fixed loci; O. kisutch = 5 fixed loci). These assays could be either dropped from further studies within the Columbia River drainage or utilized as diagnostic marker(s) for detection of strays from other regions where the alternate allele is more prevalent.
Using this set of 113 SNP markers, all five collections of O. nerka were well differentiated from one another genetically. The overall observed heterozygosity was comparable between all collections except the Redfish Lake andromous population (sockeye salmon), which had much lower diversity. This could be attributed to a genetic bottleneck with this particular collection as sockeye salmon have returned in extremely small numbers in the recent past (Winans et al. 1996) with modest increases in recent years because of a captive broodstock programme (Peterson et al. 2008). In contrast to O. nerka, weak genetic structure was observed between the four collections of Columbia River coho salmon that were tested in this evaluation. However, the observed heterozygosity across all loci was comparable between all the collections, suggesting that much of the variation from the lower Columbia River founder stock has been maintained. Also, the low GST values reported for most of the loci suggested that the collections were not strongly differentiated, but the 90% correct assignment to the Cowlitz Hatchery collection indicates that genetic structure may be evolving in the system as stocks begin to reproduce naturally, and natural origin returns are used as broodstock in upriver hatcheries. Overall, this study provides a total of 54 new SNP assays for O. nerka and O. kisutch, an evaluation of SNP marker informativeness for these two species in the Columbia River basin and a preliminary indication of their use for more broad population genetics studies.
