Ex situ conservation management remains an important tool in the face of continued habitat loss and global environmental change. Here, we use microsatellite marker variation to evaluate conventional assumptions of pedigree-based ex situ population management and directly inform a captive lowland tapir breeding program within a range country. We found relatively high levels of genetic variation (Ntotal 5 41; mean HE 5 0.67 across 10 variable loci) and little evidence for relatedness among founder individuals (Nfounders 5 10; mean relatedness 5 􏰀0.05). Seven of 29 putative parent–offspring relationships were excluded by parentage analysis based on allele sharing, and we identified 2 individuals of high genetic value to the population (mk 􏰌 0.007) that would otherwise have been excluded from the breeding program. Traditional assumptions of founders being unrelated and individuals of unknown origin being highly related led to overestimates of mean kinship and inbreeding, and underestimates of gene diversity, when compared with values found when genetic
 markers were used to inform kinship. We discuss our results utility of neutral molecular markers for ex situ conservation.
Key words: genetic variation, mean kinship, pedigree, relatedness,
As long as wild populations continue to experience severe declines due to habitat degradation, invasive species, and disease (Vie ́ et al. 2009), ex situ conservation through careful breeding of captive individuals will continue to be a useful tool for conservation (Russello and Amato 2007; Bowkett 2009). The goal of ex situ conservation is to establish a selfsustaining population that minimizes the loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding, and adaptation to the captive environment (Foose 1983; Frankham et al. 1986; Frankham 2008). This goal is driven by the tenet that captive populations should be representative of wild populations in order to maximize their utility in reintroduction and population augmentation programs (Robert et al. 2007).
To achieve the goals of ex situ conservation, breeding decisions must be directed scientifically (reviewed in Ballou and Lacy 1995). Evidence from computer simulations and empirical studies suggests that pairing individuals so as to

minimize mean kinship (mk, Ballou 1983) is the best strategy in order to maximize gene diversity (Ballou and Lacy 1995). However, because mk is a function of ancestry, a complete and accurate pedigree of the captive individuals is critical (Ballou and Lacy 1995; Rudnick and Lacy 2008), as is knowledge about the relatedness among the original captive individuals or founders (Ballou 1983). Incomplete or absent pedigree information may lead to genetically unique animals being excluded from breeding (Ogden et al. 2007) or to assumptions about ancestry that increase levels of inbreeding (Ballou and Lacy 1995) and loss of gene diversity (Willis 1993).
Specifically, 2 assumptions are made about individuals with uncertain pedigree that allows for the calculation of mk values. Wild-born individuals are assigned as founders and referred to in the studbook as having ‘‘WILD’’ ancestry. These individuals are assumed to be unrelated (mk 5 0) and have an inbreeding coefficient of 0 (F 5 0). Individuals not

known to have been captured in the wild or of unknown or uncertain ancestry within the pedigree are referred to in the studbook as having ‘‘UNK’’ ancestry and are assumed to have a high level of relatedness (mk 5 0.5), precluding them from breeding. However, the costs and benefits of these assumptions remain unclear. Simulation studies suggest that unless there are high levels of relatedness among founders, incorrectly assuming founders to be unrelated does not lead to significant losses of genetic variation over time as long as accurate pedigrees are maintained (Rudnick and Lacy 2008), a conclusion that has been corroborated by empirical evidence (Ivy et al. 2009). Assuming that individuals of uncertain ancestry have high mk, on the other hand, could represent significant losses in captive genetic diversity (Willis 1993, 2001) through the exclusion of genetically important individuals from breeding (Ogden et al. 2007).
The assumptions regarding ancestry of a captive population become even more relevant in light of recent European and American Associations of Zoos and Aquariums (EAZA and AZA, respectively) institutions reprioritization of conservation goals (WAZA 2005), leading to the phase out of many populations in favor of promoting within-range country conservation (Greene et al. 2003; Rodr ́ıguez-Clark and Sa ́nchez-Mercado 2006). Within range country ex situ conservation is important for a number of reasons. From the captive management perspective, it is theoretically more straightforward to augment the population with wild individuals and in principal easier to simulate natural conditions in enclosures (Rodr ́ıguez-Clark and Sa ́nchezMercado 2006). From an educational perspective, species’ conservation risks are brought to the attention of local stakeholders whose actions are most likely to be effective in reducing threat (Westley and Miller 2003). However, the transport of captive-bred individuals housed in nonrange countries may pose a number of problems to captive populations within range countries, such as increased overall inbreeding, dilution of unique genetic lineages, and mixing founder lineages of unknown origins, all of which conflict with the goals of a successful captive management program (Rodr ́ıguez-Clark and Sa ́nchez-Mercado 2006). Furthermore, many of the captive populations in range countries were not established with a captive breeding program in mind (e.g., Quse 2006), thus increasing the uncertainty about how separate captive populations are related. This uncertainty reduces the accuracy of breeding recommendations (Ballou and Lacy 1995) and likely increases the number of genetically valuable animals not considered for breeding (Ogden et al. 2007).
Molecular markers can assist in resolving these issues (Ivy et al. 2009). Variation at microsatellite loci can be used to reconstruct pedigrees (Blouin et al. 1996), assess founder relationships (Gautschi et al. 2003), identify genetically important individuals (Russello and Amato 2004; Ogden et al. 2007), and compare wild and captive populations (Norton and Ashley 2004; Henry et al. 2009) as well as other captive populations (Norton and Ashley 2004). In this study, we explore the use of variation at microsatellite markers for informing breeding strategies in a captive population of lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) in a range country (Argentina).
As in other South American captive populations, there has been no systematic studbook keeping until relatively recently. In 2006, a consortium of Argentinean zoos, with the support of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission’s (IUCN/SSC) Tapir Specialist Group and the AZA Tapir Taxonomic Advisory Group, initiated the development of a population studbook based on past records and staff surveys (Quse 2006). To assist in this effort, we 1) tested the assumption of unrelatedness among founders, 2) examined the genetic importance of animals of unknown origin based on relatedness and mean kinship values, 3) tested the putative pedigree relationships proposed by the studbook, and 4) compared breeding recommendations based on 4 different scenarios using a combination of management assumptions, pedigree information and genetic data to quantify the ability of different approaches to minimize mk and inbreeding, and maximize gene diversity. In doing so, we aim to contribute to a broader understanding of the utility of molecular-based tools for informing ex situ conservation.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection, DNA Isolation, and Genetic Data
Blood samples were collected from 41 captive lowland tapirs across 10 institutions in Argentina. Our sample included 10 individuals of WILD ancestry, 3 of UNK ancestry, and 28 captive-born individuals, representing 72% of the Argentinean captive population (N 5 57; Quse and Shoemaker 2008). For each sample, 250 ll of whole blood was applied to a Whatmann FTA Mini Card (Whatmann, Inc.) and allowed to air-dry for 1 h before being stored at room temperature until transport to the laboratory. We used the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Inc.) to isolate total DNA from two 1/8$ circles cut from each blot using a one-hole punch (Staples). The hole punch was flame sterilized between samples. Subsamples were mixed with 290 ll of ATL buffer plus 20 ll of Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and allowed to incubate horizontally at room temperature on a rocking table rotating at 120 rpm for 1 h. During this hour, samples were vigorously vortexed for 10 s every 10 min.

 Subsequently, 200 ll of the mixture was transferred to a new tube, and the protocol recommended by the manufacturer was followed with a final elution of 200 ll in EB buffer.
We genotyped samples at 13 microsatellite loci following the protocol described by Gonxcalves da Silva et al. (2009) (Table 1). Fragments were separated on an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and scored using GeneMapper v4.0 software (Applied Biosystems).
Data Analysis
We tested loci for null alleles using MICRO-CHECKER (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004) and removed those that tested positive from subsequent analyses. We then quantified genetic variation in the captive population by measuring allelic richness and expected heterozygosity at each locus using GENALEX 6 (Peakall and Smouse 2006). Tests for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium between loci were calculated using GENEPOP (Raymond and Rousset 1995). Significance tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using the sequential Bonferroni procedure (Rice 1989).
We compared the relatedness indices of Queller and Goodnight (1989) and Lynch and Ritland (1999) in terms of power to distinguish between unrelated and first-order pairs using the methods described by Van de Casteele et al. (2001) and implemented in iRel (Gonxcalves da Silva and Russello 2009) based on the population allele frequency distribution of 10 putative founder individuals. In total, we simulated 1000 dyads in each of 4 relatedness categories (unrelated, half sibs, full sibs, and parent–offspring) and selected the index for which the overlap in the empirical distribution of unrelated and first-order relatives’ relatedness values was minimized, thereby minimizing type I and II errors. We then examined the average relatedness among putative founders and across the whole sample. We tested the assumption that founders have an average relatedness of 0 by examining the 95% confidence interval (CI), and we identified all founder dyads that had a 􏰌0.05 chance of being unrelated based on the empirical distribution of relatedness values derived from simulated unrelated dyads. We determined the average level of relationship within the population by examining the 95% CI with expected values for unrelated, half sibs, and firstorder relatives (Blouin 2003). Finally, we examined the importance of the 3 individuals of unknown origin or parentage by calculating the average relatedness to all other individuals in the population and identifying pairs that had 􏰌0.05 chance of being unrelated.
We tested pedigree relationships by manually inspecting all putative parent–offspring pairs to ascertain that they shared at least one allele at every locus (Milligan 2003). If a putative parent–offspring failed to share at least one allele at all loci, we searched the studbook for a most likely parent within our sample based on location, age, sex, time within the institution, and genotypic profiles.
Finally, mean kinship (mk) values were calculated to identify genetically important individuals (Montgomery et al. 1997). We used Population Management 2000 (PM2000)
software (Pollak et al. 2002) to calculate mk, inbreeding (F), and gene diversity (GD) across 4 alternative scenarios comprising different levels of molecular data use: 1) the studbook data; 2) the studbook data supplemented with an empirically derived founder kinship matrix based on the genotypic data calculated using SPAGeDi (Hardy and Vekemans 2002); 3) the studbook data updated to reflect the relatedness of individuals of unknown ancestry (e.g., 2 UNK individuals recoded as WILD, see below); 4) the studbook data updated to reflect the relatedness of individuals of unknown ancestry (as in scenario 3) and supplemented with an empirically derived founder kinship matrix based on the genotypic data calculated using SPAGeDi (Hardy and Vekemans 2002).
Results
One of the 13 loci examined was monomorphic (TtGT053) and 2 tested positive for null alleles (Tte01 and Tba23) across the 10 wild-caught individuals. In the remaining 10 loci, we found a mean of 5.0 alleles per locus, 0.67 mean expected heterozygosity, and 0.015 mean inbreeding coefficient (Table 1). We did not detect any significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg or linkage equilibriums.
Comparison of the relatedness indices of Queller and Goodnight (1989) and Lynch and Ritland (1999) suggested that the latter performed better at discriminating between unrelated and first-order individuals, with fewer unrelated dyads being misclassified as first-order dyads following the criteria described by Blouin et al. (1996) (Table 2). All further analyses were therefore based on the index of Lynch and Ritland (1999) . The distribution of observed relatedness values was lognormal with a peak around zero (Figure 1). Using the empirical distribution derived from 1000 simulated unrelated dyads, we determined that a relatedness value of 􏰍0.2445 had a 􏰌0.05 probability of being unrelated (Figure 1). Among the 465 pairwise comparisons of captive-bred individuals, 63 had relatedness values 􏰍0.2445 (13.55%). Among the 45 pairwise comparisons of wild-caught individuals, only 2 yielded values .0.2445 (4.45%; studbook #s 6/54 and 48/57). Among the latter, we found a mean relatedness of 􏰀0.05 (±0.04 95% CI). Of the 3 individuals marked with UNK ancestry in the studbook, one has since

 Figure 1.
However, independent information on the captive lowland tapir population suggests that there is little possibility that the founder individuals would be closely related as they were captured in different regions of the country at different times. This was further confirmed by our relatedness analysis, where none of the pairwise comparisons among the putative founders had relatedness values above the empirically determined cutoff value. Therefore, we are confident that the low-kinship coefficients in the matrix are representative of the expected relationships among the founders.
Discussion
Genetic Variation within the Captive Population
Ultimately, the success and utility of a captive breeding program is measured by the ability of reintroduced individuals to establish a self-sustaining population (Dylan 2008). The reintroduced individuals should be representative of the evolutionary lineage in the region of reintroduction and should have sufficient genetic variation to ensure high fitness of all individuals, and therefore, a higher chance of attaining a self-sustaining population (Kraaijeveld-Smit et al. 2006). In this study, we used variation at microsatellite markers to inform a captive breeding program of lowland tapirs within a range country (Argentina).
The Argentinean captive lowland tapir population has relatively high levels of genetic diversity among individuals considered founders (Table 1). Compared with the Central American (CA) and North American (NA) captive populations of Baird’s tapir (T. bardii ) reported in Norton and Ashley (2004), the population investigated here had higher mean number of alleles (5.0 ± 1.24 95%CI vs. 3.1 ± 0.60 95%CI than the NA population) and higher expected heterozygosity (0.67 ± 0.07 95%CI vs. 0.49 ± 0.014 and 0.47 ± 0.04 95%CI, respectively, for CA and NA populations), albeit across different sets of markers. When compared with captive populations of others species, the Argentinean lowland tapir captive population presents levels of genetic diversity comparable, for instance, to levels observed in Parma wallabies (Macropus parma, Ivy et al. 2009) and much higher to those observed in the captive population of Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica, Henry et al. 2009). These relatively high levels of genetic diversity could be taken as indicators of a genetically healthy population.
Furthermore, our results indicate only moderate levels of relatedness across the population (Figure 1). This is reflected in the relatively low values of estimated F and mk and relatively high levels of GD (Table 5). This is likely a reflection of the young age of the captive population and the fact that many of the founder individuals are still alive, capable of reproducing, and comprise a large percentage of the population. However, due to the previous isolation of zoos, it is already possible to observe several individuals born from the same breeding pair within some institutions (up to 5 in one institution), which is shown here by the long right hand tail in the distribution of observed relatedness values (Figure 1). If a breeding plan is not implemented

died and was removed from further analyses; the remaining 2 (females, studbook # 21 and 68) had a mean relatedness of 􏰀0.09 (±0.02 95% CI) and 􏰀0.03 (±0.04 95% CI), respectively. Individual 21 did not have any pairwise relatedness values 􏰍0.2445, whereas individual 68 had 3 pairwise relatedness values 􏰍0.2445, the highest being 0.283. The 3 individuals (studbook # 28, 33, and 34) with high pairwise relatedness are not housed at the same institution as 68 nor have they been transferred to or from that institution, and 68 is listed as a donation from a circus. Finally, neither 21 nor 68 are listed as having bred in the past.
Allele-sharing analysis supported 22 of 29 parent– offspring relationships. One individual mismatched at one locus with both parents, all others mismatched at 􏰍2 loci. There was no bias toward mismatches occurring between putative male or putative female parents (data not shown). We were unable to identify putative parents with consistent genotypic transmission patterns for any of the 7 mismatches among the current sample.
The prioritization of genetically important individuals based on mean kinships differed across the 4 examined scenarios (Table 3). Two females (studbook # 21 and 68) previously assigned as UNK, and therefore traditionally assumed to have mk 5 0.5, were reassigned to WILD ancestry in scenarios 3 and 4 based on results presented above. This changed their ranks from 16 and 17 in scenarios 1and2toranks1and2,and3and4inscenarios3and4, respectively (Table 4). Across all 4 scenarios, there was a trend of decreasing F and mk and increasing retained population GD values with the addition of genotypic data (scenarios 2 and 4) and the proper assignment of individuals 21 and 68 as founders (scenarios 3 and 4; Tables 4 and 5). Specifically, we observed mk decreasing from 0.0607 in scenario 1 to 0.0498 in scenario 4 (Table 5).
A cautionary note should be made in relation to the use of the founder kinship matrix, as it is just as likely to overestimate as to underestimate kinship (Ivy et al. 2009).

Relatedness within the Captive Population
Molecular marker–based analyses allowed us to empirically reconstruct pedigree relationships and test hypotheses of relatedness among individuals within a captive population of uncertain history. We used allele-sharing patterns to specifically test putative parent–offspring pairs originally identified from incomplete and poorly documented breeding records. Using a criterion of ‘‘sharing at least one allele at every locus,’’ we confirmed 75% of the putative parent–offspring pairs in the population and challenged 7 others. This criterion can be very powerful for confirming putative parent–offspring relationships, however, it should be used with caution as loci with extreme biases in allele frequencies or data sets with small numbers of loci may significantly increase the probability that 2 individuals share an allele at every locus by chance alone (Christie 2010). For example, when simulating 5 loci with 10 alleles of equal frequency, Christie (2010) found that, in moderate sample sizes (N 5 200) of unrelated adults plus juveniles, roughly 1000 pairs shared at least one allele at every
locus by chance alone. By increasing the number of loci to 10 with the same number of alleles, the false-positive rate dropped to approximately 100 pairs. In this regard, our data set of 10 loci averaging 5 alleles per locus in combination with corroborating evidence regarding institutional location of individuals provided a high degree of confidence in the confirmed parent–offspring relationships.
We also specifically tested hypotheses of relatedness of 2 individuals that were of unknown origin to the rest of the captive population. We empirically derived the expected distribution of relatedness values for unrelated individuals by simulating 1000 unrelated dyads using a population allele frequency distribution estimated from the 10 original founder individuals (Van de Casteele et al. 2001; Russello and Amato 2004). This approach allowed us to assign a probability of being unrelated to each dyad given the observed relatedness value and to specify an empirically determined relatedness cutoff value (􏰍0.2445) for which a dyad had 􏰌0.05 chance of being unrelated. Because of the typically high uncertainty surrounding individual pairwise estimates of relatedness, this approach provides an empirical measure of confidence in the assignment of a dyad to a specific relatedness category given the data (Queller and Goodnight 1989; Lynch and Ritland 1999). The combined results of the paternity and relatedness analyses were

Genetic Importance of Individuals
Appropriate breeding strategies are required to achieve the goal of maximizing the retention of genetic diversity. A number of indices to identify genetically important individuals have been evaluated and minimizing mean

kinship seems to be the most appropriate as it favors the breeding of individuals that carry genetic variation that is underrepresented in the captive population (Ballou and Lacy 1995). In general, individuals are ranked according to their mk calculated from the studbook pedigree data, with the population mk providing a maximum cutoff value for inclusion into the breeding pool. Two assumptions are generally made when estimating population mk values: 1) founder individuals are considered to be unrelated among each other and 2) individuals of unknown ancestry in the studbook are assumed to have high kinship in the population and are given an mk 5 0.5. These assumptions may introduce bias in the estimate of population mk and exclude genetically important individuals from breeding, as shown here (Table 5) and by others (e.g., Russello and Amato 2004), that can be corrected for with judicious use of genetic information (Russello and Amato 2004, 2007; Ivy et al. 2009). In particular, we saw a general trend of increasing gene diversity retained and decreasing estimates of F and mk from just using conventional assumptions (scenario 1; Table 5) to incorporating genetic data to assign ancestry to individuals of unknown ancestry and specify kinship coefficients among founder individuals (scenario 4; Table 5). Thus, assuming that founders are unrelated and that individuals of unknown origin have high kinship caused F and mk to be overestimated for the tapir population under study. Our results also identified 2 individuals that are among the most genetically valuable to the captive population (i.e., have low mk), yet would not have been

 included in the breeding program in the absence of empirical genetic data (Table 3).
The Use of Molecular Markers in Captive Breeding
A number of studies have examined the utility of using molecular markers in captive breeding programs (Russello and Amato 2004; Rudnick and Lacy 2008; Ivy et al. 2009). Although there seems to be agreement that the use of molecular markers is valuable in cases of unknown ancestry or parentage of captive-bred individuals (Russello and Amato 2004; Ivy et al. 2009), their utility is still questioned in relation to determining the relationships among founders (Rudnick and Lacy 2008; Ivy et al. 2009). Two problems are particularly apparent in this regard: 1) there is a high degree of uncertainty in determining accurate relationships among individuals because of the small number of markers evaluated and lack of knowledge about the true distribution of allele frequencies (Queller and Goodnight 1989; Russello and Amato 2004; Ivy et al. 2009) and 2) assuming that founders are unrelated when in fact they are not has little effect on the maintenance of genetic diversity within the captive population if accurate pedigrees are maintained (Rudnick and Lacy 2008).
In this study, the use of molecular markers was able to confirm 75% of the putative parent–offspring relationships, identify uncertainties in parent–offspring assignments, and pinpoint 2 genetically valuable individuals that would have been otherwise excluded from breeding. In this lowland tapir population, the GD loss due to the exclusion of 2 genetically important individuals of previously unknown ancestry from breeding was not substantial (GD 5 0.939 in scenario 1 and GD 5 0.95 in scenario 4; Table 5). Yet, in captive populations of highly threatened species such as the Amur tiger (Henry et al. 2009), all individuals are potentially valuable, and excluding individuals from breeding based solely on unknown ancestry would be unacceptable when methods are available to test the assumptions. Therefore, our results are in agreement with what has been reported in other studies (Russello and Amato 2004; Ivy et al. 2009), corroborate theoretical expectations about the genetic costs to a captive breeding program of overestimating relatedness (Willis 2001), and highlight how genetic data can be used to make specific breeding recommendations to maximize the retention of genetic diversity based on hypothesis testing rather than on potentially erroneous assumptions (Appendix A).
The utility of marker-based estimates of relatedness or kinship for improving on the founder assumption remains an open question. Here, we calculated a kinship matrix based on genotypic data to specifically assign founder mk values in lieu of the assumption of unrelated founders. The results supported the background information that founding individuals were unlikely to be related due to the geographical locations from which they were captured. The use of the kinship matrix did lead to a general decrease in population mk (Table 5), suggesting that the assumption of mk 5 0 was causing the population mk to be overestimated. Nevertheless, in this population, the changes were not
substantial and this assumption did not directly affect the individuals that would be selected for breeding (compare scenarios 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 in Table 5). Thus, our results corroborate those of Ivy et al. (2009) and Rudnick and Lacy (2008) suggesting that the assumption of mk 5 0 for founders does not have a substantial effect on breeding decisions and consequently, on the maintenance of genetic diversity under a variety of conditions. Yet, because our empirical results were consistent with the founder assumption, we are not able to gauge the extent to which a high degree of founder relatedness would bias downstream measures of mk, F, and GD and hence examine how such an assumption would detrimentally impact the viability of a captive population. As a consequence, the costs of deviations from this assumption still need to be empirically determined.
Finally, although the use of molecular markers might not improve the maintenance of genetic diversity if an accurate pedigree is maintained (Rudnick and Lacy 2008), it provides a baseline for comparisons between captive and wild populations (Norton and Ashley 2004; Henry et al. 2009). Such comparisons allow for the quantification of the degree to which genetic variation of the wild population is represented in captivity, providing critical information toward achieving this fundamental goal of ex situ conservation. In addition, genetic approaches permit comparisons between captive populations (Norton and Ashley 2004), allowing targeted exchanges to avoid issues of mixing lineages of unknown origins and diluting rare lineages (Rodr ́ıguez-Clark and Sa ́nchez-Mercado 2006; Russello et al. 2007). In this regard, our study represents the first for lowland tapir, providing an important baseline for the captive management program within a range country. Future studies focusing on the extent and distribution of genetic variation within wild populations in Argentina will enable the evaluation of genetic representativeness of the captive population. In addition, this study provides a baseline for zoos attempting to identify suitable lowland tapir individuals to move from North American or European zoos to Argentina.
Overall, genetic approaches to ex situ management continue to be important tools for meeting conservation goals (Russello and Amato 2007; Bowkett 2009). Rapidly diminishing costs associated with data collection render moot financial arguments against using genetic approaches for collecting valuable historical and genealogical information that can inform breeding programs. Moreover, our ability to supplement the important insights gained from neutral genetic variation with detection and quantification of adaptive variation continues to increase with the emerging field of population genomics as well as with the number of whole-genome sequencing projects that genome enable many nonmodel organisms of conservation interest (Haussler et al. 2009). The direct or indirect assay of adaptive genetic variation will build on early work focused on the major histocompatiblity complex (Gilpin and Wills 1991; Hughes 1991; Miller and Hedrick 1991) and will be sure to reinvigorate debate associated with current paradigms related to the genetic management of ex situ populations.

Appendix A: implications and recommendations for Argentinean lowland tapir ex situ conservation
Recommendation 1: Seven putative parent–offspring relationships were not confirmed and should be amended in the studbook
The reconstruction of the pedigree based on zoo records and staff surveys (Quse and Shoemaker 2008) proved to be remarkably accurate with approximately 75% of the putative parent–offspring relationships confirmed by allele-sharing analysis. At least 4 hypotheses could explain the unconfirmed putative parent–offsprings: 1) genotyping errors in the form of allelic dropout or null alleles would cause mismatches in putative parent–offspring genotypes; 2) group herding within institutions can preclude the correct assignment of parentage; 3) female parents allow other calves besides their own to nurse; and 4) incomplete or incorrect record keeping would cause calf parentage to be incorrectly assigned.
Separating these 4 hypotheses is difficult, as they are not mutually exclusive, and all could be occurring simultaneously throughout the pedigree. Nevertheless, genotyping errors seem unlikely, as 1) we removed loci with evidence for null alleles and 2) the majority of the 7 identified putative parent–offspring pairs that did not share at least one allele at every locus had 􏰍2 mismatches (Christie 2010). Incorrect assignment of parentage as a result of group herding is also unlikely because tapirs are not usually kept as herds (Shoemaker A, personal observation), and there are no known records of calves nursing on females other than their mother—although observations suggest that in the absence of their mother, tapir calves will seek protection from other adults within an enclosure (Pukazhenthi B, personal communication). Finally, record keeping in South American institutions has not been systematic mostly because the captive populations were not setup with conservation breeding in mind (Rodr ́ıguez-Clark and Sa ́nchez-Mercado 2006). Yet, considering the financial and human resource challenges faced by most South American institutions, it
should be noted that 75% accuracy in parentage assignment is significant and indicates a good starting point for a breeding program. Further examination of the studbook did not allow for the identification of the missing parents from our current sample.
Recommendation 2: Individuals 21 and 68 should be treated as founders
The studbook (Quse and Shoemaker 2008) classified 3 individuals as having uncertain ancestry (UNK, studbook # 21, 52, and 68). Individual 52 died before the conclusion of this study and was therefore removed from further analyses. There are no records pertaining to individual 21 being born in captivity or having been caught in the wild. Individual 68, on the other hand, is recorded as a donation from a circus. Here, we used the relatedness index of Lynch and Ritland (1999) to evaluate the degree of relatedness of individuals 21 and 68 to the rest of the captive population and examined the probability that these individuals were unrelated to all individuals in the population (Van de Casteele et al. 2001; Russello and Amato 2004). This approach allowed us to assign a probability of being unrelated to each dyad given the observed relatedness value and to specify a relatedness cutoff value (􏰍0.2445) for which a dyad had 􏰌0.05 chance of being unrelated. Pairwise comparisons of individuals 21 and 68 to all other individuals in the sample yielded 3 comparisons above the cutoff value for individual 68 and none for individual 21. Of the 3 comparisons that yielded values above the cutoff, the highest was ;0.28, whereas the other 2 values were ;0.25. In addition, examination of the studbook suggests that these 3 individuals (studbook # 28, 33, and 34) would have had little chance of being related to individual 68. As such, it is very likely that the relatively high observed relatedness values between individual 68 and these 3 individuals is due to chance alone.
Recommendation 3: Use both the kinship matrix to specify the degree of relatedness among founding individuals and the genetic data to inform the ranking of individuals for captive breeding
There are 4 potential scenarios for estimating the genetic importance of individuals with distinct assumptions of ancestry and use of independent genetic data including: 1) the studbook data only; 2) the studbook data supplemented with an empirically derived founder kinship matrix based on the genotypic data; 3) the studbook data updated to reflect the relatedness of individuals of unknown ancestry (e.g., 2 UNK individuals recoded as WILD, see below); and 4) the studbook data updated to reflect the relatedness of individuals of unknown ancestry (as in scenario 3) and supplemented with an empirically derived founder kinship matrix based on the genotypic data. Based on our results, we recommend using the updated studbook data in combination with marker-based estimates of founder kinship as scenario 4 maximized GD and minimized F and mk relative to the other approaches. However, it remains important to stay cognizant of the caveats to this approach as discussed in the text.
