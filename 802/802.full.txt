The use of MSR (Minimum Sample Richness) for sample assemblage comparisons
Kenny J. Travouillon, Gilles Escarguel, Serge Legendre, Michael Archer, and Suzanne J. Hand
Abstract.—Minimum Sample Richness (MSR) is defined as the smallest number of taxa that must be recorded in a sample to achieve a given level of inter-assemblage classification accuracy. MSR is calculated from known or estimated richness and taxonomic similarity. Here we test MSR for strengths and weaknesses by using 167 published mammalian local faunas from the Paleogene and early Neogene of the Quercy and Limagne area (Massif Central, southwestern France), and then apply MSR to 84 Oligo-Miocene faunas from Riversleigh, northwestern Queensland, Australia. In many cases, MSR is able to detect the assemblages in the data set that are potentially too incomplete to be used in a similarity-based comparative taxonomic analysis. The results show that the use of MSR significantly improves the quality of the clustering of fossil assemblages. We conclude that this method can screen sample assemblages that are not representative of their underlying original living communities. Ultimately, it can be used to identify which assemblages require further sampling before being included in a comparative analysis.

Introduction
Taxonomic comparisons of sample assemblages are often used to distinguish different communities in time, space, and habitat types. In the specific context of paleobiological studies, the incomplete nature of the fossil record is a major problem in those comparisons, potentially resulting in incorrect interpretation of patterns of similarities. Travouillon et al. (2006) identified such problems in their comparison of the Riversleigh Local Faunas (Oligo-Miocene assemblages from northwestern Queensland, Australia), which are fossil assemblages with mammal species richness varying from 1 to 43 taxa. There are a number of methods to estimate the completeness of a sample assemblage (e.g., species accumulation curves, nonparametric species richness estimators, completeness index). Ultimately, there is no need for a complete or near complete data set (which is often impossible to achieve from paleontological data) if the available data contain enough information to confidently reflect ‘‘true’’ taxonomical similarities between assemblages due
to environmental and/or chronological identities (Andrews 2006; Go ́mez Cano et al. 2006).
The Minimum Sample Richness (MSR) has been developed for such purpose (Travouillon et al. 2007). MSR is defined as the average minimum number of taxa that must be identified in a sample assemblage to achieve a given (95% in this work) level of classification accuracy using taxonomical similarity-based multivariate analyses. MSR distributions are known for four classical indices based on presence/absence data: Dice (5Sørensen), Jaccard, Simpson, and Raup-Crick. Although Travouillon et al. (2007) introduced and discussed the potential of MSR, the aim of this paper is to further explore the applicability and power of this new tool.
MSR is calculated from estimates of absolute species richness and similarity for each compared community (or life assemblage). Once absolute species richness and similarity are estimated for each community, then MSR is calculated and can be used to identify which sample assemblages are species-rich enough to give a statistically accurate representation of

their community. This is one strength of the MSR method—to eliminate from a comparative analysis all sample assemblages possibly corrupting, if not disrupting, any meaningful similarity pattern.
Here, the aim is to explore the efficiency of the MSR method. For this purpose, we consider in succession two distinct mammalian case studies, focusing on chronological clustering, although this approach could also be used for other purposes (e.g., environmental or biogeographical clustering). First, we apply this twofold methodology to a data set of 167 sample assemblages from the Mammal Paleogene (MP; Aguillar et al. 1997) and Mammal Neogene (MN; Mein 1999) biochronological scales of the Quercy and Limagne area (Massif Central, southwestern France). This data set is well suited to testing this methodology because (1) the biochronological framework underlying this data set is fairly well established (Remy et al. 1987; Legendre and Bachelet 1993; Aguillar et al. 1997; Escarguel et al. 1997), (2) the mammalian evolutionary history is well resolved at the local and regional levels (Legendre 1986, 1989; Legendre et al. 1997a, 2006; Escarguel and Legendre 2006; Escarguel et al. 2008), and (3) the species richness of the studied assemblages ranges widely from 1 to 51 taxa. Second, the method is applied to a data set of 84 sample assemblages from the OligoMiocene Riversleigh fossil assemblages (northwestern Queensland, Australia; Archer et al. 2006; Travouillon et al. 2006). In this biochronologically less constrained and evolutionarily less resolved case, we use MSR to detect and eliminate species-poor assemblages. Although we test the MSR method here on biochronological data, the technique may also be used for other types of data, notably environmental and biogeographical data (Louys et al. 2009).
Material and Methods
Data Sets.—The first case study is based on the data collected for more than 20 years by Legendre for Cenozoic mammal communities of the Quercy and Limagne area (Massif Central, southwestern France; see Legendre 1986, 1987a,b,c,d, 1989; Legendre et al. 1991, 1997b, 2006; Legendre and Hartenberger 1992; Legendre and Bachelet 1993; Escarguel et al.
1997; Legendre and Girard 1999; Escarguel and Legendre 2006). The incidence data set is composed of the observed occurrences of 350 mammalian (excluding bats) phyletic lineages within 167 local faunas. Each local fauna is assigned to one of the 17 successive biochronological units identified for the studied time interval, including 15 Paleogene reference levels (MP16 to MP30, excluding MP27) and two Neogene zones (MN01 and MN02a) (see Legendre and Bachelet 1993; Aguilar et al. 1997; Escarguel et al. 1997). For the purpose of this study and in order to be able to test the methodology, we assumed that each local fauna is correctly assigned to its proper biochronological unit. Names and biochronological units of each local fauna are listed in supplemental Appendix Table 1 (online at Dryad, doi:10.5061/dryad.p1b6b).
For the second case study, we use published mammal occurrence lists for the Riversleigh species assemblages (see Archer et al. 2006), following Travouillon et al. (2006) with a few modifications (see supplemental Appendix Table 3 for modifications). Of the 75 sites studied by Travouillon et al. (2006), all are used except the four youngest: Rackham’s Roost Site (Pliocene), Terrace Site (Pleistocene), Carrington’s Cave and Message Stick Cave (Recent). We excluded these sites because here we are focusing on Oligo-Miocene deposits only. Thirteen new mammal-bearing sites are then included: Micro Site, Baker’s Delight Site, Angela’s Sinkhole Site, Crusty Meat Pie Site, Group Site, Golden Steph Site, Panorama Site, Phil’s Phenomenal Fissure Fill Site, Jeanette’s Birthday Site, Black Coffee 2 Site, Neville’s Pancake Site, Steph’s Small Reward Site, and Rick’s Sausage Site. Species occurrences in these sites are listed in Appendix Table 3, including corrections, additions, and updates to the original lists given by Archer et al. (2006). Only taxa with unambiguous identification were included. Site names are listed in supplemental Appendix Table 2. Biochronological nomenclature follows Arena (2004) and Travouillon et al. (2006).
Cluster Analysis.—We performed a preliminary clustering on both case study data sets to determine the quality of the clustering before applying the MSR methodology. The

neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei 1987) as implemented in the PAST software (Hammer et al. 2001) was used to cluster assemblages using presence/absence of mammalian taxa. The neighbor-joining method is more suitable for chronological data because it minimizes the total sum of branch lengths (producing a phenogram) rather than producing an ultrametric tree (or dendrogram) as per the more usual hierarchical techniques (e.g., Single and Complete linkage, UPGMA, and UPGMC) in which branch lengths are constrained so that the distance from the root to each tip is the same (Escarguel 2005). Bootstrap values were also calculated for each node of the phenogram, from 1000 replicates.
In all cases, we submitted the resulting neighbor-joining-tree (NJ-tree) to a ‘‘quality analysis’’ (Gue ́noche and Garreta 2001). We selected six overall quality criteria, among them three metrics (the variance accounted for [Vaf], Pearson’s correlation [R], and Kruskal’s stress [St]), and three topological indices (the arboricity coefficient, the rate of well-designed quadruples, and the rate of elementary quadruples)(seeGue ́nocheandGarreta2001for details). On the one hand, the metric criteria are based on direct quantitative comparison between the observed distance matrix D and the patristic distance matrix T associated with the NJ-tree. They measure the overall fit between the observed and patristic distance matrices: the closer Vaf and R to 1, and the closer St to 0, the more similar D and T. On the other hand, the topological criteria are based on the qualitative comparison of the topology of the quadruples (i.e., trees made of only four sample assemblages) implied by the observed distance matrix D and by the NJ-tree T. The arboricity coefficient (Arb) is the percentage of quadruples of D for which the median sum involved by Buneman’s quadruplet inequality is closer to the largest one than to the smallest one; the overall rate of well-designed quadruples (Rq) is the percentage of quadruples having the same topology according to D and T; the overall rate of elementary quadruples (Re) is the percentage of elementary quadruples of D that support an internal edge of T. These criteria estimate the overall topological congruence of T and D: the
higher topological congruence, the more T actually reflects the structural information contained in D.
In addition to these overall criteria, we computed the ‘‘individual’’ percentage of welldesigned quadruples (IRq) for each sample assemblage, as well as the ‘‘individual’’ rate of elementary quadruples (IRe) of D supporting a given internal edge of T. IRq allows us to identifying assemblages that are potentially illplaced within T (low IRq values), whereas IRe values are reliability estimates, based on D, of the bipartitions induced by each internal edge of T. On the single basis of the available information as synthesized in D, these ‘‘individual’’ indices provide insights into the confidence associated with the edges of T: a low IRq value indicates that its associated sample assemblage is positioned in T with difficulty; IRe provides similar interpretation for an internal edge separating two sets of assemblages. In other words, low IRq and IRe values indicate that the corresponding internal and external nodes are not supported by the available data, because of either a lack of information or contradictory evidence.
MSR Calculations.—For each biochronological unit of each analyzed data set, MSR was calculated using Travouillon et al.’s (2007) equation:
ceil􏰒􏰇􏰀:{5 􏰋2􏰈 MSR~floor 7 10 |A |S
z􏰇􏰀3:10{3|A􏰋|S􏰈􏰓if Sƒ0:5, if Sw0:5
where A is the estimated absolute total species richness and S is the largest similarity value between the sample assemblages recorded in the considered biochronological unit, estimated using the Dice index of similarity (Dice 1945). A was computed using the Chao-2 nonparametric estimator of total species richness for incidence data (Chao et al. 2006), as available in the SPADE software (Chao and Shen 2003).
For each biochronological unit, two distinct estimation strategies of A and S were adopted:
1. A first estimate was obtained by taking into account all the available local faunas correlated to the biochronological unit (‘‘all sites’’ results, given in Fig. 2).

2. Because estimation of the Chao-2 index requires a minimum of two sample assemblages, a second estimate of A and S was obtained by considering only the two local faunas with the highest sampled species richness within the biochronological unit (‘‘two sites’’ results, given in Fig. 3).
In both cases the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval associated with A were also calculated.
Given that the computation of the Chao-2 estimator is based only on the number of unique and duplicate species (i.e., species found in only one or two sites, respectively), estimates of A based on the two richest sample assemblages are expected to be lower than those based on all available assemblages. Nevertheless, using all local faunas may not necessarily give a better estimate because it may overestimate the unique/duplicate ratio, and thus A, as a consequence of the general incompleteness of the fossil record. However, the same problem also applies when considering only two sample assemblages if the species lists have very few species in common, as a consequence of ‘‘false’’ absences.
For each biochronological unit and computation strategy, we then calculated MSR from estimated values of A and S. For each estimation strategy, we actually calculated three MSR estimates: a ‘‘mean MSR,’’ an ‘‘upper MSR,’’ and a ‘‘lower MSR,’’ using the mean Chao-2 estimate (A) and the upper and lower limits of its associated 95% confidence interval, respectively. Note that we ran all analyses in both case studies with all three estimations of A because we wanted to identify as part of the methodology which estimation was the best, and to identify the risks of using the other estimations.
Finally, once MSR estimates were calculated for each biochronological unit, we used these MSR values to construct reduced data sets including only those sample assemblages with species richness greater than or equal to their associated MSR. These reduced data sets were then analyzed using the two-step procedure (similarity matrix computation and additive cluster analysis) described in the previous section. A total of nine cluster analyses were made: for the Quercy and
Limagne data set, three using two sites per biochronological unit and three using all sites, and for the Riversleigh data set, three using two sites per biochronological unit.
Results and Discussion
Preliminary Cluster Analysis.—We performed a preliminary clustering on both case study data sets to determine the quality of the clustering before applying the MSR methodology. The preliminary neighbor-joining trees are shown in Figure 1 (A, Quercy and Limagne, and B, Riversleigh). Both preliminary clusters show that the data set is ideal for testing the MSR methodology because several chronologically similar sites cluster away from each other, suggesting that most sites have too few taxa to correctly cluster with their own group. For both data sets, results of the ordinary bootstrap and the quality analysis are notably different, with bootstrap supports in most branches very low (,50) but quality values generally quite high (.70%). This is probably the consequence of very low presence/absence ratios in both cases, leading to excessively conservative bootstrap support values.
Case Study 1: Quercy and Limagne area.— Species richness, similarity and MSR values were calculated and are shown in Table 1. Table 1A shows the results calculated by using all sites whereas Table 1B shows the results of using only two sites. Although one might expect the use of all sites to give better estimates than using two sites, the methodology would be circular if all sites were used to calculate an MSR for all sites. This is because the estimated similarity used to calculate MSR is dependent on the faunas included within each biochronological unit, and so it is preferable to use two sites from the same biochronological unit (MP/MN) to calculate a MSR value, and to determine the minimum number of species required to represent the biochronological unit.
With the exception of MP20 and MP30, the Chao2 estimates of species richness are much larger when all sites are used (Table 1A) than when only two sites are used (Table 1B). Using all sites may also overestimate the species richness owing to a high number of single occurrences contributed by less-sampled sites.

The opposite can be expected from using two sites—having fewer single occurrences (more shared occurrences) would result in an underestimate of species richness. Hence one would expect that the lower Chao2 would be the more accurate estimate for all sites, whereas the upper Chao2 would be the more accurate estimate for two sites. In terms of similarity,
the Dice similarity index gave fairly comparable similarity values, ranging from about 30% to 70% similarity, whether all or just two sites were used. The resulting MSR values calculated from the Chao2 estimates and from the similarity values are much higher when using all sites rather than just two sites (Table 1). Both of these values were then used to select sites

 (see site list in supplemental Appendix Table 1) that would be used for cluster analysis.
We selected sites with species richness above the MSR value. Sites selected using the ‘‘all sites’’ upper MSR are shown in Figure 2A, ‘‘all sites’’ mean MSR in Figure 2B, and ‘‘all sites’’ lower MSR in Figure 2C. Only five sites (3%) had species richness higher than the upper MSR (Fig. 2A): two from MP16, 1 from MP19, and 2 from MP28. The five sites cluster as expected, and the bootstrap supports and quality values are very high. Arboricity and the mean percentage for well-designed quadruples (WDQ) are both at 100%, demonstrating that this tree, based on the analyzed data, is of the highest possible quality. In Figure 2B, 19 sites (11.4%) had a species richness higher than the mean MSR
value. Again, sites cluster as expected and bootstrap supports and quality values are high. Overall, the tree is of far better quality than the preliminary cluster (Fig. 1A), having an arboricity of 80% and mean WDQ of 87.9%. Using the lower MSR (Fig. 2C), we selected 30 sites (18%). Here, the first few incongruous clusters are identified, such as MP19_11 (Rosie` res 2) clustering with MP20_4 (Tabarly) instead of MP19_4 (Escamps), MP28_1 (Cournon) clustering with MP30_2 (Coderet C3) instead of MP28_3 (pech Desse) and MP28_4 (Pech du Fraysse), and MN02a_1 (Chavroches) clustering with MN01_6 (Peublanc) instead of MN02a_5 (Montaigu). Note that in each of these cases, these sites cluster with the only representative site of a biochronological unit (e.g., MP20_4 Tabarly is the

only representative of MP20 in this cluster). Bootstrap supports and quality values are generally lower for these clusters than for expected clusters. Also, the arboricity and mean WDQ are very similar to the mean MSR tree.
Figure 3 shows the clusters based on the ‘‘2 sites’’ upper MSR (Fig. 3A), mean MSR (Fig. 3B), and lower MSR (Fig. 3C). The upper MSR, mean MSR, and lower MSR selected 25 (15%), 48 (28.7%), and 54 (32.3%) sites, respectively. The ‘‘2 sites’’ upper MSR cluster (Fig. 3A) contains only two unexpected clusters, with MP28_1 (Cournon) distant from other MP28 sites and MN02a_1 (Chavroches) clustering with MN01_6 (Saulcet) instead of MN02a_5 (Montaigu). The biochronological units have very strong bootstrap supports and quality values compared to the preliminary cluster (Fig. 1A), showing the robustness of these units. Nodes connecting these units, however, are much weaker, but the cluster is not expected to correctly order each unit chronologically. Compared to the ‘‘all sites’’ trees, this tree is of lower quality than the upper MSR tree, but higher quality than the mean MSR and the lower MSR trees. The ‘‘2 sites’’ mean MSR cluster (Fig. 3B) and lower MSR cluster (Fig. 3C) are very similar, having the same unexpected clusters for MP18 to MP24 and MP28 to MP30, and having lower bootstrap supports and quality values. The upper MSR would therefore be a better value to use because it minimizes the number of incorrect groupings due to low species richness.
In terms of methodology, the MSR values should be calculated using the minimum number of sites (2) to avoid circular reasoning. Nevertheless, the results show that when two sites are used to calculate the MSR value, species richness may be underestimated, and therefore the MSR value may also be underestimated. For this reason, we recommend using the upper MSR rather than the mean MSR or lower MSR for clustering. Mean MSR and lower MSR can still be used carefully. However, it can become very difficult to differentiate incorrect groups caused by an underestimation of MSR or falling within the 5% type I error rate of the MSR method. Mean MSR and lower MSR have very similar tree
quality (arboricity and WDQ), which may favor lower MSR over mean MSR because it allows the inclusion of more sites for the same quality as the mean MSR tree.
Single representatives of biochronological units (e.g., MN01_6 [Saulcet]) also may result in incorrect clustering because they lack a similar site with which to cluster. Additionally, incorrect clustering is potentially caused by the presence of many long-range species (common to more than one biochronological unit, as opposed to short-range or biochronologically unique species). Some species survive longer than others; some species are more common than others. If the index taxa of a specific biochronological unit are not present in the sample, the sample itself might incorrectly cluster with another biochronological unit that has the same long-range taxa. This may be a weakness of MSR because it does not identify samples containing too few index taxa.
Cross-Comparison of Preliminary Analysis versus MSR-based Results with Quality Analysis Results.—To test the effectiveness of the MSR method in detecting samples that potentially introduce spurious similarity structures in a comparative analysis, we plotted sample richness of each site against the percentage of well-designed quadruples (%WDQ), representing the quality of the achieved clustering in each analysis. Figures 4 and 5 show that in the preliminary analyses, sites with the largest sample sizes do not have significantly higher %WDQ values than sites with low sample sizes, but instead show some of the lowest %WDQ values in both data sets. This clearly illustrates that including sites with very low sample richness decreases the average quality of clustering of all sites, including those with high sample richness. When the MSR method is applied, the overall quality of the resulting clusters markedly increases, and sites with the highest sample richness tend to have the largest %WDQ values, as expected. The upper MSR clearly gives the best quality results in all cases, with a mean %WDQ well over the mean of other analyses, whereas results using mean MSR and lower MSR are similar, with very close mean %WDQ values. The p-values associated with the regression lines of Figure 4 show weak

Case Study 2: Riversleigh.—Riversleigh’s biochronological units, Faunal Zones A, B, C, and D (Travouillon et al. 2006), are quite different from Western Europe MP and MN units in terms of time scale. Riversleigh’s faunal zones are much less precise and, because of the uncertain age of the included sites, therefore potentially span a much longer period of time. To calculate the MSR values of each faunal zone, we selected two sites from each faunal zone with the highest species richness. These sites are FZA_D (D Site) and FZA_WH (White Hunter Site) for Faunal Zone A, FZB_CS (Camel Sputum Site) and FZB_U (Upper Site) for Faunal Zone B, and FZC_Gag (Gag Site) and FZC_HH (Henk’s Hollow Site) for Faunal Zone C. The results are shown in Table 2. The upper Chao2 estimates of species richness were particularly high for Faunal Zone A, despite the fact that the two sites used for the estimate have much lower species richness values than the sites used for Faunal Zones B and C. This unrealistic estimate is mainly caused by the large numbers of single occurrences in the two sites, which have quite different faunas perhaps representing two distinct time periods within Faunal Zone A. The estimated species richness of the other two faunal zones seems more realistic and is similar to species richness estimates for the Quercy and Limagne area. In terms of similarity, Riversleigh’s faunal zones are much more dissimilar to each other, with values ranging from 0.27 to 0.4, than the MP and MN assemblages of the Quercy and Limagne area, where
values ranged from 0.3 to 0.7. Overall, the MSR estimates are lower for Riversleigh’s faunal zones than for the Quercy and Limagne area. Riversleigh sites with species richness higher than the lower MSR, mean MSR, and upper MSR values for each faunal zone were selected for cluster analysis. FZD_En (Encore Site), being the only Faunal Zone D site, was also selected in all three cluster analyses.
The upper MSR, mean MSR, and lower MSR clusters are shown in Figure 6A, 6B, and 6C respectively. Ten sites were selected using the upper MSR, 18 sites using mean MSR, and 23 sites using the lower MSR. In contrast to the clusters produced for Quercy and Limagne area, which are unrooted trees (no particular site was used as an ‘‘outgroup’’), the clusters presented in Figure 6 are rooted, with FZD_ En as an ‘‘outgroup’’ because it contains the most-derived fauna from Riversleigh’s OligoMiocene deposits. The methodology developed using the Quercy and Limagne area data set suggests that the upper MSR cluster will be the most trustworthy and should contain the fewest incorrect clusters, if any.
In this study, we estimated the MSR of each of the three major Riversleigh biochronological units, Faunal Zones A, B, and C. Of the 84 Riversleigh sites examined in this study, only ten sites can be confidently used as representative of the faunal zones, having sufficient taxa in their faunal lists and not showing any taxonomic biases. These sites are FZA_WH, FZB_WW, FZB_DT, FZB_NG, FZB_U, FZB_CS, FZC_Gag, FZC_HH, FZC_COA (Cleft of Ages site), and FZD_En. Inclusion of other Riversleigh sites not selected by the MSR method is likely to introduce noise and generate misleading results.
Recommendations for the Use of MSR.—MSR should be used to cluster unknown sites on the basis of their taxonomic composition only with

sites of known relationship. This means that the MSR method does not test the original relationship of the known sites but instead identifies which unknown sites have a complete enough taxonomic composition to be correctly grouped within the known groups.
The inclusion in future studies of more sites from the mean MSR or lower MSR list should be done with caution because these may lower the confidence of interpretations. We recommend using only results obtained with the upper MSR.
Conclusions
In this study, MSR methodology was tested on two real cases corresponding to very different taxonomical, ecological and biogeographical contexts. This technique seeks to eliminate from a given data set all fossil sites that could potentially be too incomplete to use in a cluster analysis. The method was demonstrated to be robust and to provide high confidence in the clustering of fossils sites. This method requires inclusion of at least two sites per biochronological unit, which are used to calculate a species richness estimate for the biochronological unit, as well as an estimate of the similarity between the units compared in the analysis. From the estimates
of species richness and similarity, MSR is calculated, giving the minimum number of taxa required for a site to correctly cluster as a representative of the biochronological unit. It is established that the weakness of the MSR method is the assumption that all species are equal from the point of view of locality and sample making. The presence of many common species and few rare species in the faunal list of a site may lead to incorrect clustering of those sites. Despite the fact that this weakness cannot be eliminated, this method is able to identify assemblages that are poorly sampled, and significantly improve clustering of them based on their taxonomic composition. Consequently, we recommend using sites that are selected by the MSR method and discarding those that are poorly sampled.
