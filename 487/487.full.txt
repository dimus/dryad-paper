Abstract.—The main goals of this study were to provide a robust phylogeny for the families of the superfamily Curculionoidea, to discover relationships and major natural groups within the family Curculionidae, and to clarify the evolution of larval habits and host-plant associations in weevils to analyze their role in weevil diversi􏱍cation. Phylogenetic relationships among the weevils (Curculionoidea) were inferred from analysis of nucleotide sequences of 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA; »2,000 bases) and 115 morphological characters of larval and adult stages. A worldwide sample of 100 species was compiled to maximize representation of weevil morphological and ecological diversity. All families and the main subfamilies of Curculionoidea were represented. The family Curculionidae sensu lato was represented by about 80 species in 30 “subfamilies” of traditional classi􏱍cations. Phylogenetic reconstruction was accomplished by parsimony analysis of separate and combined molecular and morphological data matrices and Bayesian analysis of the molecular data; tree topology support was evaluated. Results of the combined analysis of 18S rDNA and morphological data indicate that monophyly of and relationships among each of the weevil families are well supported with the topology ((Nemonychidae, Anthribidae) (Belidae (Attelabidae (Caridae (Brentidae, Curculionidae))))). Within the clade Curculionidae sensu lato, the basal positions are occupied by mostly monocot-associated taxa with the primitive type of male genitalia followed by the Curculionidae sensu stricto, which is made up of groups with the derived type of male genitalia. High support values were found for the monophyly of some distinct curculionid groups such as Dryophthorinae (several tribes represented) and Platypodinae (Tesserocerini plus Platypodini), among others. However, the subfamilial relationships in Curculionidae are unresolved or weakly supported. The phylogeny estimate based on combined 18S rDNA and morphological data suggests that diversi􏱍cation in weevils was accompanied by niche shifts in host-plant associations and larval habits. Pronounced conservatism is evident in larval feeding habits, particularly in the host tissue consumed. Multiple shifts to use of angiosperms in Curculionoidea were identi􏱍ed, each time associated with increases in weevil diversity and subsequent shifts back to gymnosperms, particularly in the Curculionidae.

Adaptive radiation explains two related phenomena: taxonomic groups that represent a proliferation of related species marked by distinctive use of a particular resource (or some other dimension of the environment) and related species in such a group that usually differ from one another in small ways, reducing their ecological overlap. Adaptive radiations are thus usually characterized by major shifts in ecological traits, often associated with morphological features that seem to provide entry into such a different set of ecological niches (Futuyma, 1998). Those shifts are also often postulated to explain differences in diversity among lineages (Mitter et al., 1988; Farrell, 1998a). Characterization of the details of such radiations is necessary

for study of the potential role of natural selection in diversi􏱍cation, which would inform models of speciation. Here, we report characterization of the rates of evolution of several dimensions of host use by the plant-feeding beetles known as weevils.
Weevils represent one of the most stunning radiations of animals and thus 􏱍gure prominently among the phenomena to be explained (Mayr, 1963). Collectively, weevils use every plant part and nearly every plant taxon (Anderson, 1995), and yet related species are often similar in host use. Weevils constituting various taxonomic groups feed on plant roots, stems, leaves, 􏱎owers, fruits, or seeds. They may be among the 􏱍rst enemies to consume healthy plants or may be specialists on decaying tissues or the dead remains of plants felled by other causes (Farrell et al., 2001; Lanteri et al., 2002). Taxonomic groups of weevils are also often restricted to particular host groups,

 specializing on conifers, cycads, dicots, or monocots or on subsets of these plant taxa, although there are many exceptionally polyphagous species. Because weevils and other herbivores have shifted niches among plant parts and plant taxa innumerable times, studies of the rate and direction of change in these different aspects of host use may reveal repeated patterns. These patterns would suggest further lines of inquiry into the possible ecological and genetic bases that could eventually permit synthesis of evolutionary processes among and within species.
Weevils are classi􏱍ed as the superfamily Curculionoidea, which contains about 60,000 species and 6,000 described genera (Thompson, 1992; Kuschel, 1995). With its sister group Chrysomeloidea, the weevils constitute a radiation of phytophagous insects rivaled in species diversity only by the Lepidoptera (Farrell, 1998a, 1998b). The Curculionoidea is one of the richest groups in terms of potential for insights into the evolution of diversity and remains one of the more challenging taxonomic groups in terms of stability of classi􏱍cation.
To date there have been three cladistic analyses of weevil morphology for the purpose of establishing higher relationships within Curculionoidea (Kuschel, 1995; Marvaldi, 1997; Marvaldi and Morrone, 2000). Kuschel (1995) published a cladogram for families and subfamilies of Curculionoidea, resulting from the analysis of 24 terminals (subfamily groups) plus an outgroup “Chrysomeloidea” and 138 characters from adults (113) and larvae (25). The monophyly of these terminal units was assumed a priori. This phylogeny estimate shows six weevil families: Nemonychidae, Anthribidae (including Urodontinae), Belidae (including Oxycoryninae and Aglycyderinae), Attelabidae (including Rhynchitinae), Brentidae (including Apioninae, Carinae, and Cyladinae), and Curculionidae (this large family classi􏱍ed with only six subfamilies, each resulting from amalgamation of several traditional ones). Marvaldi (1997) assessed higher relationships within the Curculionidae sensu lato based mainly on larval characters, with the main aim of testing monophyly of Kuschel’s subfamily Brachycerinae. Marvaldi (1997) analyzed 19 terminals (subfamily groups, of which 13 are smaller units of Brachycerinae) plus an outgroup “Brentidae” and 49 characters from larvae (41), pupae (3),
and adults (5). Larvae of »120 representative species were examined to score the states for each summarized terminal. Results of the cladistic analysis refute the hypothesis of monophyly of Brachycerinae, this being an assemblage of different groups of broad-nosed weevils. In addition, larval and pupal characters support a close relationship between Dryophthorinae and Platypodinae. Marvaldi and Morrone (2000) reviewed larval and adult morphological information and constructed a new data matrix for Curculionoidea. New characters included were those for the larvae of Caridae (May, 1994) and Ocladiinae (Marvaldi, 2000) that were unavailable when Kuschel (1995:19) and Marvaldi (1997) undertook their respective analyses. That family level cladistic analysis of Curculionoidea was based on 100 characters (72 from adults and 28 from larvae), using 13 terminal taxa, previously de􏱍ned, corresponding to seven families of Curculionoidea of which the largest, Curculionidae, was represented by seven smaller units. The chrysomeloid Palophaginae was used as the outgroup. Although results of the cladistic analysis at the family level were in some respect similar to those of Kuschel (1995), there were some important differences such as the sister group relationship of Nemonychidae and Anthribidae and the Caridae as a distinct family and sister to the clade Brentidae Curculionidae. However, the relationships within Curculionidae sensu stricto (a single terminal) were not assessed.
An earlier (Farrell, 1998a) quantitative phylogenetic analysis of the Phytophaga (Curculionoidea C Chrysomeloidea) was based on 115 nearly complete sequences from the nuclear 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene, analyzed together with a morphological matrix compiled from the data of Kuschel (1995) and Reid (1995). The weevil families were represented by 45 species in Farrell’s study. Here, we expand the taxonomic sampling for both 18S rDNA and morphology to 100 species, including the families Anthribidae and Caridae (formerly not represented) and more representatives for Nemonychidae and particularly for Curculionidae.
The main goals of this study were to provide a robust phylogeny for the families of Curculionoidea, to discover relationships and major natural groups within the

 family Curculionidae, and to clarify the evolutionary sequence of shifts in larval habits and host-plant associations for study of their potential role in weevil diversi􏱍cation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens Examined
We obtained samples of 100 species of weevils, selected to maximize morphological and ecological diversity. Weevil taxa used in this study, collecting areas, and GenBank accession numbers are in Table 1. A great proportion of the species sequenced were collected and identi􏱍ed by C. W. O’Brien. Voucher specimens (preserved in ethanol) were deposited in the Farrell laboratory at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University. All extant families of Curculionoidea and the main subfamilies are represented: Nemonychidae (Rhinorhynchinae, Cimberidinae), Anthribidae or fungus weevils (Anthribinae), Belidae (Belinae, Oxycoryninae), Attelabidae or leaf-roller weevils (Attelabinae, Rhynchitinae), Caridae (Carinae), Brentidae (Eurhynchinae, Antliarhininae, Apioninae, Cyladinae, Ithycerinae), and Curculionidae sensu lato. The Curculionidae is represented by about 80 species in 30 “subfamilies” in traditional classi􏱍cations (e.g., Dryophthorinae, Erirhininae, Entiminae or broad-nosed weevils, Curculioninae, Molytinae, Cossoninae, Scolytinae or bark beetles, Platypodinae or ambrosia beetles, etc.; Thompson, 1992). Three outgroup species from the Chrysomeloidea (Palophagoides vargasorum, Prionus laticollis, and Dendrobius sp.) were included. The 􏱍rst two were chosen because they represent two basalmost chrysomeloid families and subfamilies, Megalopodidae (Palophaginae) and Cerambycidae (Prioninae), according to Farrell (1998a). The third, Dendrobius sp. (Cerambycinae), was simply selected at random among several possible outgroups.
Molecular Data
Ampli􏱍cation and sequencing of rDNA.—
Total genomic DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved weevil adults (or if necessary larvae) following an adapted version of the “salting out” protocol of Sunnucks and Hales (1996) as modi􏱍ed in Normark (1999). Double-stranded template suitable for sequencing was prepared for 18S rDNA via
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampli􏱍cation using conserved primer pairs (e–r1138 and f1094–Q) from Sequeira et al. (2000), which ampli􏱍ed two regions with a 100-bp overlap. The temperature pro􏱍le was 40 cycles of 95±C for 30 sec, 47±C for 60 sec, and 72±C for 90 sec. The PCR products were puri􏱍ed using the QIAquick spin-column puri􏱍cation kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). Puri􏱍ed samples were run on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide to assay the intensity of the product and to check for possible secondary ampli􏱍cation products. The puri􏱍ed PCR product was used as the template for double-stranded sequencing, using the primers used for PCR ampli􏱍cation plus six internal primers (f420, r803, f1403, and r1626) (Sequeira et al., 2000) and primers f876 (CGCGGTGCTCTTCATTGAGTG) and r1439 (CGCTCCACCAACTAAGAAC) designed in Farrell’s laboratory by B. Normark (numbers correspond to the position of the 30 end in the Tenebrio molitor sequence for 18S rDNA (GenBank accession X07810). Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle-sequencing kits were used to prepare the sequencing reactions. Both strands of the 18S rDNA fragments were sequenced following the ABI protocol for automated sequencing, using an ABI Prism 370A sequencer (Perkin Elmer Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Alignment of ribosomal sequences.—Sequences were edited and aligned by visual inspection using the Sequencher 3.0 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) sequence editor. “Conserved” regions of the alignment could be aligned unambiguously by hand, but we could not align 10 small regions to our satisfaction, and these positions (239–245, 251–282, 753–756, 788–881, 1570– 1573, 1602–1684, 1689–1692, 1699–1701, 1712–1719, 1722–1725) were excluded from phylogenetic analyses. However, each of these regions were replaced by a single coded character, added to the end of the alignment. The regions are nucleotide sequences of variable length for individual taxa that have no corresponding sequence in the outgroups and in several weevil taxa.
As an additional criterion for exclusion of hypervariable regions, we constructed computer alignments using different alignment parameters in CLUSTAL X (Thompson et al., 1997). Three different gap insertion/extension cost combinations were used: 15/6.6 (default), 10/2, and 10/1.

2002 MARVALDI ET AL.—PHYLOGENETICS OF WEEVILS 767
 Saturation levels for the more conserved and hypervariable regions due to multiple substitutions were identi􏱍ed by plotting transition/transversion (ts/tv) ratios versus the overall distance and by comparing these ratios with the ts/tv expected values based on the base composition as described by Holmquist (1983) (not shown). Hypervariable regions (in all alignments) present a pattern of asymptotic divergence that suggests saturation due to multiple sustitutions in these sites; therefore, the exclusion from the analysis is also backed by this result. The two extremes of the gene (positions 1–50 and 2055–2153) were excluded to avoid excessive missing data for several taxa.
Gap treatment.—The recommendations of Lutzoni et al. (2000) and Kjer et al. (2001) were helpful in dealing with regions containing gaps. Length heterogeneous regions containing insertions and/or deletions were evaluated separately (Kjer et al., 2001:786). Ten regions (positions 239– 245, 251–282, 753–756, 788–881, 1570–1573, 1602–1684, 1689–1692, 1699–1701, 1712–1719, 1722–1725) that were of equivocal alignment were categorized as indels. Indel regions of variable length apparently were phylogenetically informative in some lineages. Therefore, we eliminated the nucleotide characters from the analysis but coded each unique combination of nucleotides in these variable regions with a different symbol. The implementation of this coding method was not problematic when using PAUP¤ because we identi􏱍ed up to 25 states, not exceeding the maximum of 32 states per character allowed by the program.
A molecular data matrix (2,153 positions after alignment) for 100 species of Curculionoidea plus 3 outgroup chrysomeloid species was constructed (for GenBank accession numbers, see Table 1). In this study, 55 of the weevil sequences are new and were added to the 45 available from Farrell (1998a). Outgroup sequences for the chrysomeloids also came from Farrell (1998a) and are in GenBank under accession numbers AF267418 (Palophagoides), AF267413 (Prionus), and AF267403 (Dendrobius). The 􏱍nal alignment of 1,761 included positions (1,771 positions considering indel characters) yielded 312 potentially informative characters. The data matrix with the alignment (including the character sets for data removal) is available on the TREEBASE web-
site (www.herbaria.harvard.edu/treebase/), submission number S764.
Morphological Data
In previous cladistic analyses the terminal units were families or subfamily groups. In the present study, the terminal units are 100 representative species. We compiled a new and enlarged morphological data set and scored the states for most species, using specimens from the samples sequenced. In some cases (e.g., if the larva was not described), we assumed the state found in a closely related, often congeneric, species (see Appendix 1). For the sake of clarity the morphological data are grouped into larval and adult characters and described brie􏱎y in Appendix 1. The morphological data matrix of 115 characters (37 from larvae and 78 from adults) is shown in Table 2 (http://systematicbiology.org).
Biological Data
The variation in host associations and larval habits embraced by the sampling of species and lineages is summarized and coded in Table 3. The phylogeny estimate was used to trace the evolution of these features. Optimization of these traits (which were not part of the phylogenetic analyses, to avoid circularity) was performed using PAUP¤ 40b.4a (Swofford, 1998).
Phylogenetic Analyses
Although we believed that the best estimate in this study would most likely be obtained from the combined analysis, separate phylogenetic analyses of the data sets (molecular and morphology) were also performed for comparative purposes. Separate and combined analyses were conducted under the maximum-parsimony optimality criterium. The molecular data set was also analyzed using model-based Bayesian inferences.
Molecular data analysis using Bayesian inference.—Modeltest 3.06 (Posada, 2001) was used to select the most likely model for the 18S rDNA data set. All searches were performed with Mr. Bayes 2.01 (Huelsenbeck, 2001). Bayesian searches were run with four simultaneous chains for 400,000 generations, sampling every 100 generations and applying temperatures of 1, 0.5, and 0.3, which in􏱎uence the rate of switching between chains.

 TABLE 3. Biological data. Character list and data matrix. Information on the host plants and larval habits was gathered from the literature and/or the collection data of the specimens studied. The term “dicots” is herein applied to the major clade of 􏱎owering plants (true dicotyledons) that together with the monocots constitute the clade euangiosperms (see Qiu et al., 1999, and references therein). The latter is distinct from earliest angiosperm lineages such as the water lilies, herein referred as basal angiosperms. The four characters were scored as follows: (1) major host taxon used: 0 D Pteridophyta; 1 D conifers; 2 D cycads; 3 D basal angiosperms (i.e., Nymphaceae); 4 D monocots; 5 D Dicots. (2) Larval habit inside or outside of host: 0 D endophagous or internal feeding; 1 D external feeding concealed (i.e., in soil or mud); 2 D external feeding exposed (i.e., on aerial plant parts); 3 D combined internal/external concealed; 4 D combined internal/external exposed. (3) Tissue consumed by larvae: 0 D stem, twig, trunk; 1 D leaf; 2 D root; 3 D fruit or 􏱎ower bud; 4 D seed; 5 D male strobili, pollen sacs; 6 D female strobili, ovules, or seeds; 7 D male strobili, vegetative tissues; 8 D female strobili, vegetative tissues; 9 D fungi. (4) State of host plant tissue at moment of consumption: 0 D living, healthy; 1 D dying, decaying.

 The burning or stationarity generation was determined by plotting generations versus log likelihoods (Ln L); all trees below that stationarity level were discarded. The selected model was the general time reversible model (GTR) (Rodriguez et al., 1990), estimating the proportion of invariable sites and the shape of the gamma parameter.
Characteristics of the molecular data set.—The model that best describes the substitution types for the 18S rDNA data set is a simpli􏱍cation of the GTR model. The proportion of invariant sites was 0.3919, and the estimated shape of the gamma parameter was 0.4295. The ts/tv ratio was 1.4. The substitution rate calculated for the data set excluding hypervariable regions (1,761 included positions) was 0.4272 (SD-0.0163). The proportion of parsimony informative sites in the ingroup was 17.14%. A smaller proportion was found for another beetle group, the Chrysomeloidea (10.67%), from Farrell’s (1998a) data matrix expanded.
Molecular, morphological, and combined data analyses using parsimony.—The 18S molecular data matrix and the mophological matrix were analyzed separately and together. The phylogenetic analyses were parsimony based using PAUP¤ 4.0b4a for Macintosh (Swofford, 1998). The molecular matrix was also analyzed with NONA 2.0 (Goloboff, 1998). The program WINCLADA 0.9 (Nixon, 1999b) was used to convert the matrix in nona format and also to visualize trees and character optimization. The program MacClade 3.0 (Maddison and Maddison, 1992) was used for combining data matrices. Separate and combined analyses were performed with all characters equally weighted and treated as unordered; gaps were treated as explained above.
The molecular data matrix (1,771 included characters, 1,761 positions plus 10 indel characters) was analyzed using the ratchet method (Nixon, 1999a) as implemented in PAUP¤, by means of 15 pct (default proportion of weighted characters in the search). The molecular data matrix excluding the indel characters (1,761 positions) was also analyzed using the ratchet method with NONA, with the commands “hold/1; nixwts 180 50;”. Analysis of the morphological data matrix (115 characters) was carried out using a heuristic search: 1,000 random addition sequence (RAS) replicates, two trees held at each step during stepwise addition, tree
bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping, and no upper limit of MaxTrees. Analysis of the combined data matrix (1,886 characters) was performed using a heuristic search: 5,000 RAS replicates, two trees held at each step during stepwise addition, TBR branch swapping, and no upper limit of MaxTrees.
Support to tree topology was evaluated by means of bootstrap values (also jackknife for the combined) as measured by PAUP¤ using the “faststep” option.

Separate Analyses of the 18S rDNA Data Set under Bayesian and Parsimony Optimality Criteria
Bayesian inference of phylogenetic relationships.—The Bayesian topology obtained (Fig. 1) shows >50% estimated posterior probability for the monophyly of the superfamily Curculionoidea and for several family groups within it: Nemonychidae (excluding Doydirhynchus) C Anthribidae, Belidae, Attelabidae (excluding Auletobius), and a clade comprising Caridae, Brentidae, and Curculionidae. Within this latter clade there is support for a partial grouping within Brentidae and for several subfamilies of Curculionidae (e.g., Bagoinae, Ceutorhynchinae, Baridinae, Gonipterinae, and Dryophthorinae excluding Stromboscerini). Other groups supported by Bayesian estimation are partial groupings within Cossoninae, Derelominae, Entiminae, Scolytinae, and Platypodinae. Figure 1 shows 31 nodes with >50% probability that are recovered in the combined tree, although there are also some “unexpected” relationships with high probability (i.e., Caenominurus C Stenopelmus, Cylas C Pachylobius). Relationships between subfamilies in the speciose subfamily Curculionidae were not resolved by the molecular data, neither by the Bayesian (Fig. 1) nor the parsimony (Fig. 2) estimation.

 resulted in 29 most-parsimonious trees (MPTs) (2,119 steps, consistency index [CI] excluding uninformative characters D 0.35, retention index [RI] D 0.43), the strict consensus of which is presented in Figure 2. Other search strategies performed (as for the combined analysis below) resulted in trees that are one to two steps longer than the MPTs obtained with the parsimony ratchet method.
The analysis of the molecular data matrix excluding the indel characters (1,761 positions) resulted in 49 MPTs of 2,008 steps, the strict consensus of which (not shown) show the same well-supported (bootstrap >50%) nodes as the ones resulting from the analysis of the matrix of 1,771 characters. Some but not all of these MPTs agree with results from morphology in the close relationship between Nemonychidae and Anthribidae and Caridae as sister group to Brentidae C Curculionidae. There was a spurious attraction between two attelabines and some curculionid divergent sequences that was recti􏱍ed when indel characters were included (Fig. 2).
The 21 nodes that are well supported (>50%) in the 18S parsimony cladogram (Fig. 2) are in agreement with the relationships proposed by morphology (Fig. 3) and in the combined tree (Fig. 4). In total, the 18S parsimony tree (Fig. 2) has 31 nodes that were also recovered in the combined tree (Fig. 4). Although the 18S data (Fig. 2) also propose relationships that differ from the morphological cladogram (Fig. 3), none of these (“unexpected”) nodes are highly supported (values <50%), thus resulting in weakly supported topological incongruence.
Analysis of the morphological data set.—Parsimony analysis of the morphological data matrix (115 characters) was carried out using a heuristic search with PAUP¤: 1,000 RAS replicates, two trees held at each step during stepwise addition, TBR branch swapping, and no upper limit of MaxTrees. The search resulted in 984 MPTs (230 steps, CI excluding uninformative characters D 0.59, RI D 0.93), the strict consensus of which is presented in Figure 3.
The morphological tree (Fig. 3) has 32 nodes (24 with support >50%) that were also recovered in the combined tree (Fig. 4).
Combined analysis of 18S rDNA and morphology data.—Heuristic searches retained four MPTs (2,456 steps, CI excluding uninformative characters D 0.36, RI D 0.60), the strict
consensus of which is depicted in Figure 4, showing bootstrap and jackknife values. One of the MPTs is presented in Figure 5, and the morphological apomorphies de􏱍ning each node are listed in Appendix 2.
The combined 18S C morphology tree (Fig. 4) shows an improvement in resolution with respect to those trees from separate analyses, with a larger number of well-supported clades (42 nodes with bootstrap and jackknife values >50% plus 4 nodes with at least one of those values >50%). Not all clades found in the combined tree (Fig. 4) were present in the ones from the individual 18S (Fig. 2) and morphological (Fig. 3) data sets. This result suggests the existence of phylogenetic signal (hidden by homoplasy in results of separate analyses) that emerged after combining the data partitions.
Weevil Relationships
Results of the combined analysis show that monophyly of weevil families and their interrelationships are in general well supported (Fig. 4); only the taxon Brentidae is supported by values of <50%. The combined analysis of 18S rDNA plus morphology data resolved groups at higher levels, but most relationships within the Curculionidae are relatively weakly supported, as indicated by bootstrap/jackknife values (Fig. 4) and will require further study.
The combined cladogram shows a close relationship of Anthribidae and Nemonychidae, as also suggested by results of the morphological analysis and in some but not all trees from the 18S separate analysis. These two weevil groups share similar oviposition structures (Thompson, 1992: 􏱍gs. 170–172; Howden, 1995) and setiferous patches (Oberprieler, 1999). Although fossil Nemonychidae are known from Jurassic beds (Kuschel, 1983; Zherikhin and Gratshev, 1995), fossils attributable to Anthribidae are known only from the Middle Cretaceous (Fig. 5; Zherikhin, 1993), consistent with their use of angiosperms and angiospermdependent ascomycetes and basidiomycetes but implying the possible paraphyly of Nemonychidae. More extensive sampling of these two families may resolve the history of host use. Results of both separate (Figs. 1–3) and combined (Fig. 4) analyses support an enlarged concept of the Belidae including Belinae and Oxycoryninae.

 The basal position of the Belidae suggested (weakly) by the separate 18S rDNA parsimony analysis is refuted when morphological characters are added or under Bayesian inference but remains as an interesting hypothesis to be tested with the use of additional genes. The fossil evidence (Fig. 5) shows that Belidae were present in the Jurassic (Zherikhin and Gratshev, 1995), which is in accordance with the basal dichotomy of Curculionoidea (Fig. 4) leading to Nemonychidae C Anthribidae and Belidae C remaining families.
A monophyletic Attelabidae was recovered in the combined analysis (Fig. 4), but the placement of Auletobius is ambiguous in results of molecular data alone (18S). The oldest fossils (Fig. 5) attributable to Attelabidae are from late Lower Cretaceous (Gratshev, 1998) to Middle Cretaceous (Kuschel et al., 1994), but the phylogenetic placement of the family would predict that older fossils may be found.
The phylogenetic position of Car and its allies (Caridae) has been enigmatic for a long time. Different authors have included Car and related taxa in different families, e.g., Attelabidae (Crowson, 1955), Apionidae (Wibmer and O’Brien, 1986), Belidae (Thompson, 1992; Zherikhin and Gratshev, 1995), Curculionidae (Kuschel et al., 1994), and Brentidae (Kuschel, 1995), whereas others considered them to be a distinct family (e.g., Zimmerman, 1994a). Results of the combined cladistic analysis (Fig. 4) support placement of Caridae (here represented by Caenominurus topali) as sister taxon of the clade Brentidae C Curculionidae. This placement is also present in the morphology tree (Fig. 3) and was recovered in some but not all 18S rDNA parsimony trees. The Caridae (Fig. 5) are known from Late Jurassic deposits (Arnoldi, 1977; Gratshev and Zherikhin, 1999) and were abundant in the Lower Cretaceous (Kuschel et al., 1994). The original concept of Brentidae was widened by several authors (Morimoto, 1976; Kuschel, 1990, 1995; Thompson, 1992) to include Eurhynchinae, Antliarhininae, Cyladinae, Apioninae, and Nanophyinae (and also Carinae; Kuschel, 1995). Exclusion of Carinae is supported by the present study.
The combined analysis (Fig. 4) places the monotypic (and enigmatic) genus Ithycerus in the Brentidae, in accordance with Oberprieler (2000), but independent analyses of
morphology and molecules do not support this grouping. This 􏱍nding can be regarded as a possible example of phylogenetic signal that emerges when the data are combined. The oldest described fossil of a brentid is an eurhynchine from Middle to Upper Cretaceous (Kuschel et al., 1994), but several middle Lower Cretaceous brentid fossils (Fig. 5), attributable to eurhynchines and nanophyines, were described by V. Zherikhin (R. Oberprieler, 2000 in litt.).
The limits and de􏱍nition of a monophyletic family Curculionidae have always been problematic. Changes in the suprageneric taxa included in this family have resulted because of taxa of ambiguous or equivocal placement (such as Ithycerus) and more importantly because of the more or less inclusive concept of Curculionidae adopted by various authors (see references in Marvaldi and Morrone, 2000).
The results of the present study (Fig. 4) clearly establish the family Curculionidae as the sister group to the Brentidae and permit identi􏱍cation of Curculionidae as a monophyletic group (see Fig. 5 and Appendix 2 for larval and adult apomorphies de􏱍ning the Curculionidae). The oldest described fossil of a curculionid (Fig. 5) is Cretulio nucula from late Lower Cretaceous deposits (Zherikhin, 1993). Its tentative placement in Erirhininae is consistent with the placement of erirhinines among the most basal curculionids in our cladogram (Fig. 4). Thus, the Curculionidae and their sister group Brentidae date to the Lower Cretaceous, near the origin of angiosperms.
Curculionids classi􏱍ed in Ocladiinae, Erirhininae and Dryophthorinae, which retain the primitive orthocerous type of male genitalia (Morimoto, 1962a; Kuschel, 1971; Thompson, 1992), occupy basal positions in the phylogeny estimate (Fig. 4). Although sequences were not available for representatives of two small groups with orthoceroustype genitalia (Brachycerinae and Cryptolarynginae), the morphological characters suggest they are among the basal members of the Curculionidae. Evidence for a close relationship between Brachycerinae sensu stricto and Ocladiinae is provided by both adult (Thompson, 1992) and larval (Marvaldi, 2000) morphology. Larvae of the Cryptolarynginae remain unknown, but adult morphology suggests a close relationship to Ocladiinae or Erirhininae (Marvaldi

 and Morrone, 2000; R. Oberprieler, 2000 in litt.). The Erirhininae in the strict sense of Kuschel (1971; see also Alonso-Zarazaga and Lyal, 1999) are dif􏱍cult to delimit. According to our study, there are no clear larval or adult synapomorphies to justify their monophyly, and when molecular data are added, they appear to be paraphyletic (Fig. 4). However, monophyly of the Dryophthorinae is strongly supported, and they probably represent an independent offshoot sister to the remaining Curculionidae.
Curculionidae sensu stricto, with the derived gonatocerous type of male genitalia (node 190 in Fig. 5; see Appendix 2 for apomorphies de􏱍ning this clade), is the largest group of weevils, in agreement (except for the inclusion of Platypodinae) with the restricted concept of Curculionidae proposed by Thompson (1992) and Zimmerman (1993, 1994a, 1994b). Some of the curculionid “subfamilies” were recovered in the combined cladogram (Fig. 4), with high support values found for their monophyly (e.g., Bagoinae, Entiminae, Baridinae, Ceutorhynchinae, Platypodinae). Other “subfamilies” appear to be polyphyletic (e.g., Molytinae, Derelominae) or paraphyletic (e.g., Cossoninae, Scolytinae) in the combined analysis, but these determinations are weakly supported and further evidence is required.
Support for the monophyly of Platypodinae is present in both separate and combined parsimony analyses, and their inclusion in Curculionidae is clear (Figs. 2–4). The exact position of the platypodines within that family, however, remains enigmatic. The Platypodinae have been considered by several authors as a distinct family, mainly because unique adult morphological characters (e.g., Calder, 1989, 1990; Thompson, 1992; Lyal and King, 1996) were interpreted as providing none or equivocal evidence of relationship to any other group of weevils. However, the larval characters naturally place them within Curculionidae (May, 1993) and suggest a close relationship of Platypodinae with Dryophthorinae (Marvaldi, 1997). The combined molecular and morphological analysis (Fig. 4) indicates that the Platypodinae are best included in the Curculionidae as proposed by Crowson (1955) and Kuschel (1995), but their condition as apomophic derivatives of the Scolytinae (Kuschel et al., 2000; Farrell et al., 2001) is only weakly supported by the present analysis and mainly determined by
adult morphology, without any clear larval synapomorphy (Figs. 3–5).
Biological Data and Phylogeny
We used a delayed (deltran, slow) optimization on one of the MPTs from the combined analysis (Fig. 5) to analyze the evolution of host-plant associations and larval habits. The accelerated (acctran, fast) optimization was not preferred because it proposes an origin of association with dicot angiosperms in the ancestor of Curculionoidea (with reversals to gymnosperm feeding in Nemonychidae, Belidae, and Caridae), which the fossil record indicates to have existed in the Jurassic, before the origin of euangiosperms.
DISCUSSION
Collectively, weevils have colonized virtually every plant group and every plant part, but particular lineages often show strong conservatism in the evolution of host use. Weevil lineages that are classi􏱍ed at ranks from subfamilies to groups of genera are primarily associated with one of the major vascular plant groups: cycads, conifers, monocots, or dicots. The earliest weevils, represented today by the depauperate families Nemonychidae, Belidae, and Caridae (see Fig. 5), continue associations with gymnosperms (i.e., conifers) formed in the Mesozoic, dating back at least to the late Jurassic. The phylogenetic evidence that these three weevil families are older than angiosperms is corroborated by their occurrence as Jurassic fossils and their disjunct relictual distributions, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. Thus phylogenetic, fossil, and biogeographic evidence suggest that the association of Nemonychidae and Belidae with strobili of conifers has been conserved for  ̧200 million years (Farrell, 1998a).
The present study provides continued support for the association of increased diversity with shifts from gymnosperms to angiosperm hosts (Fig. 5; Farrell, 1998a). The phylogeny estimate (Fig. 5) permits identi􏱍cation of multiple origins of associations with monocots and dicots and several further shifts to conifers and cycads. Thus, although some weevils are among the original conifer feeders, other weevil groups associated with these plants (particularly within

778 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 51
 Curculionidae) seem nested well within clades of angiosperm feeders, representing shifts back to gymnosperms.
Monocot Use
Several major weevil lineages (herein represented by species in the Ocladiinae, Erirhininae, and Dryophthorinae) that appear primarily associated with monocots have a basal phylogenetic position in the clade Curculionidae (Fig. 5). The early association with monocots, plants otherwise little used by weevils outside the family Curculionidae, characterizes some 2,300 species and suggests an early role played by the monocots in the diversi􏱍cation of the Curculionidae, as suggested by Reid (2000) for its sister group the Chrysomeloidea (Table 4). The proximity of these lineages on the phylogeny estimate suggests a common origin of monocot feeding that is comparable to that characterizing the common ancestor of the subfamilies Criocerinae, Hispinae, Bruchinae, and Donaciinae of the Chrysomelidae (Farrell, 1998a; Reid, 2000; Farrell and Sequeira, in prep.). Like the weevils, these chrysomelid subfamilies each specialize on different monocot groups. The Brachycerinae and Criocerinae are mainly associated with Liliaceae; the Ocladiinae, Dryophthorinae, and Hispinae are mostly associated with the grasses, palms, and gingers; and the Erirhininae and Donaciinae largely use the aquatic monocot families (Kuschel, 1971, 1995; Farrell, 1998a; Reid, 2000; Farrell and Sequeira, in prep.).
The phylogeny estimate for the curculionids, together with evidence from weevil fossils, suggests that these weevils may approach the early Cretaceous age of the monocots. The monocots constitute an early offshoot from relatively basal angiosperms, according to recent molecular and phylogenetic studies (Qiu et al., 1999, and references therein), with oldest known fossils dating from the Middle to Upper Cretaceous
(Gandolfo et al., 1998), an age coincident with that of the Curculionidae (Fig. 5) and with the monocot—associated chrysomelid subfamilies (Wilf et al., 2000). Monocot diversi􏱍cation thus may have facilitated the early diversi􏱍cation of curculionids and chrysomelids, although the greatest diversity of each beetle group is associated with dicots.

The larvae of Curculionoidea are primitively endophagous, feeding inside host tissues. Like the endophagous longhorn beetle family Cerambycidae, weevil larvae have lost the development of legs (Crowson, 1955; Stehr, 1991; Marvaldi, 1997; Farrell, 1998a). Larval endophagy is obviously associated with adult rostrum development and oviposition behavior. Most weevils use the rostrum to place eggs inside larval substrates, but the adults of Scolytinae and Platypodinae tunnel deep inside tree trunks and branches for adult feeding and oviposition. Adults of broad-nosed weevils, such as those in the large subfamily Entiminae, do not use the rostrum for oviposition and resemble the chrysomelid subfamily Eumolpinae in that the larvae feed on roots from adjacent positions in the soil. Although relationships among broad-nosed weevils are still weakly resolved, the larval habit of Amycterinae may be transitional between the primitive endophagous habit of most weevils and burrowing in soil for root feeding in the Entiminae. Newly hatched larvae of Amycterinae are internal root feeders, whereas older larvae feed from an external position protected by an earthen cell open to the root (Howden, 1987). Construction of earthen cells for feeding has also been reported for other broadnosed weevils in Thecesterninae (McClay and Anderson, 1985), in some Rhytirrhininae (Scott and Way, 1989), and in Lixinae (O’Brien and Marshall, 1987). Thus, even the external root feeders are still endophagous in the sense that they live concealed inside the

 substratum (Marvaldi, 1997). Being totally legless, larvae of Curculionidae are mostly endophagous feeders, although some instances of larval ectophagy have evolved, e.g., as exposed external feeders on leaves in Gonipterinae (Gonipterus and Oxyops), Rhytirrhininae (Listroderes), or Hyperinae (Hypera). This development is in sharp contrast with the habit of larvae in the comparably diverse family Chrysomelidae, which have retained legs and where ectophagy (external leaf feeding) is predominant. Predicted consequences of leaf feeding are higher overall rates of parasitism (Hawkins, 1994), and external feeding insects show fewer instances of interspeci􏱍c competition than do internal feeders (Denno et al., 1995). Contrasts of sister groups that differ in larval feeding mode should provide insights into the possible macroevolutionary consequences of the presumably different selective regimes to which these larvae are subject.
Feeding inside coniferous tissues, probably branches and trunks, appear to be the ancestral larval habit in Curculionoidea. Pollen feeding in male strobili of conifers, as it occurrs in Nemonychidae, is also the larval habit of basal chrysomeloids (Palophaginae) and of the basal lineages of the Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera (Kuschel and May, 1990, 1996; Farrell, 1998a, 1998b), which suggests that these relatively protein-rich resources were instrumental in fostering the origins of herbivory in these three holometabolous orders (Farrell, 1998b).
Although most curculionoids feed on tissues of vascular plants, dependence on fungi, fungus-modi􏱍ed host tissues, or fungusriddled wood has evolved in the Anthribidae, Attelabidae, in some Brentidae, and in Scolytinae and Platypodinae, typically enabling use of a broad array of host-plant groups (Holloway, 1982; Beaver, 1989; May, 1993; Oberprieler, 1999; Farrell et al., 2001).
Compared to specialists on conifer and cycads, the angiosperm feeding weevils occupy a larger array of larval niches (Fig. 5), including stem/trunk boring, root feeding, folivory, leaf mining, and seed and fruit feeding, although it is not clear whether these differences re􏱎ect greater average disparity (i.e., given the greater numbers of both hosts and weevils). Larval feeding habits clearly are highly conservative; species with similar habits (strobilus feeders, root feeders, leaf miners, aerial leaf eaters, seed feeders)
usually appear grouped together or in close proximity (Fig. 5). Some of these feeding habits are apparently irreversible (e.g., feeding on leaves or seeds), whereas stem and trunk boring frequently give rise to use of other tissues.
Larvae in several groups of weevils develop on host tissues that are not living, raising the issue of whether such associations should be expected to evolve as associations with obviously living, and thus defended, plant parts (Anderson, 1995). Our phylogeny estimate (Fig. 5) shows that development in dying tissues characterizes most basal weevils except Nemonychidae (i.e., Anthribidae, Belidae, Attelabidae). This 􏱍nding suggests that angiosperm colonization by these weevils is coupled with breeding in decaying tissues, whereas consumption of living tissues of angiosperms occurrs remarkably in the brentid–curculionid clade.
CONCLUSIONS
An important aspect of this study is the compilation of a comprehensive body of evidence on weevil relationships by including DNA sequences and morphology of both larva and adult stages for exemplars from every weevil extant family, with multiple representatives from the major subclades. Combination of the molecular data with morphology provides resolution not achieved by separate analyses. The estimate of curculionoid relationships allows a more stable higher classi􏱍cation of the superfamily. Also, the limits of the largest family, Curculionidae, now are de􏱍ned more clearly and the Curculionidae is shown con􏱍dently to be monophyletic. Perhaps because the curculionid clade went through an explosive radiation, further resolution of their phylogenetic relationships requires a much more extensive sampling of characters (more genes and new morphological data) and taxa.
Several aspects of host use are highly conservative, and groups with similar life histories emerged in the combined analysis. Association with conifers is ancestral and likely formed in the Jurassic or earlier, and multiple shifts to angiosperms, coupled with shifts in larval feeding habits, are associated with increases in diversity. The present study shows that niche shifts in host-plant associations and in larval feeding habits accompany diversi􏱍cation of weevils, today numbering
