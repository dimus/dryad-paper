Abstract
Taxanes are defensive metabolites produced by Taxus species (yews) and used in anticancer therapies. Despite their medical interest, patterns of natural diversity in taxane-related genes are unknown. We examined variation at five main genes of Taxus baccata in the Iberian Peninsula, a region where unique yew genetic resources are endangered. We looked at several gene features and applied complementary neutrality tests, including diversity ⁄ divergence tests, tests solely based on site frequency spectrum (SFS) and Zeng’s compound tests. To account for specific demography, microsatellite data were used to infer historical changes in population size based on an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach. Polymorphism-divergence tests pointed to positive selection for genes TBT and TAT and balancing selection for DBAT. In addition, neutrality tests based on SFS found that while a recent reduction in population size may explain most statistics’ values, selection may still be in action in genes TBT and DBAT, at least in some populations. Molecular signatures on taxol genes suggest the action of frequent selective waves with different direction or intensity, possibly related to varying adaptive pressures produced by the host–enemy co-evolution on defence-related genes. Such natural selection processes may have produced taxane variants still undiscovered.

Introduction
Terpenes, including taxanes, constitute one of the most important groups of plant chemicals, with wide implications in primary and secondary metabolism (Gershenzon & Dudareva 2007). In conifers, they are known to play an essential role in the constitutive and induced defence responses against herbivores and pathogens (Keeling & Bohlmann 2006). For instance, in taxane-rich yew, a low presence of insect fauna and only few fun-

gal diseases have been observed comparatively with other tree species (Thomas & Polwart 2003); moreover, several taxane compounds have demonstrated antifeedant (Daniewski et al. 1998) and antibiotic activity (Young et al. 1992; Elmer et al. 1994).
Aside from their ecological function, many terpenes have great commercial significance because of their multiple applications in human alimentation, agriculture and medicine (Roberts 2007). Among those with pharmaceutical applications, taxanes, and specifically paclitaxel⁄taxol, represent one of the world’s leading anticancer agents. Paclitaxel and relatives are produced in the wild almost exclusively by Taxus species, but their extraction from natural populations is neither sustainable nor reliable (Croteau et al. 2006).

less, most of the pharmaceutical supply still depends on plant sources, that is, cell culture or chemical conversion of precursor molecules isolated from needles of widely distributed species such as Taxus baccata (Frense 2006).
Genetic defence mechanisms are known to evolve rapidly and have wide geographical variation because of strong and geographically variable selective pressure (de Meaux & Mitchell-Olds 2003). Thus, high (and spatially structured) variability is expected for candidate genes underlying defence mechanisms. In spite of their medical relevance, the genetic variation of taxane production is poorly known. Yew species are among those trees with widest natural ranges (see Thomas & Polwart 2003 for distribution maps), so that novel products and more productive populations might still be found in some locations. Indeed, a considerable variation in yield of taxol-related products has been found among species, populations and genotypes (e.g. Hook et al. 1999; Dempsey & Hook 2000; van Rozendaal et al. 2000; Parc et al. 2002), although geographical variation has not been fully explored yet. Moreover, the intraspecific genetic diversity and adaptive role of major candidate genes related to taxol production have never been investigated at the population and regional scale.
European yew (T. baccata L.) is a dioecious, slowgrowing, long-lived gymnosperm. Natural of Eurasian temperate and Mediterranean forests (spanning from North Africa to Scandinavia, up to 63°N, and from the Iberian peninsula to the Caspian Sea), yew grows under a wide range of environmental conditions. In spite of its ecological breadth and apparent stress tolerance, this species is thought to be declining all over its distribution range. Current threats include overgrazing, habitat degradation and progressively drier climatic conditions (Thomas & Polwart 2003; Sanz et al. 2009). Weak regional differentiation but high values of population divergence at small spatial scale seem to characterize the species diversity at neutral molecular markers. These patterns have been interpreted as the result of either long-term metapopulation dynamics (Hilfiker et al. 2004) or fragmentation of a formerly continuous distribution (Dubreuil et al. 2010; Gonza ́lez-Mart ́ınez et al. 2010). Especially, Mediterranean yew populations show extreme isolation and genetic signature of inbreeding and genetic drift (Gonza ́lez-Mart ́ınez et al. 2010). As the threat of population extinction is high in many locations that may contain unique genotypes, it would be thus timely to study the patterns of variation at potentially exploitable genes (including those involved in taxane biosynthesis). This will help understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the species and directing efforts to preserve or manage the more valuable populations. However, addressing genome variation in European
yew is challenging. Specific molecular markers are scarce (Dubreuil et al. 2008), no common garden tests are available, and genome-wide tools are yet to be developed.
A generally difficult task in research aiming at identifying gene variation underlying functional traits is to distinguish the different evolutionary forces responsible for the observed patterns of diversity and differentiation, that is, historical demography vs. natural selection. This can be achieved using statistical approaches relatively robust to demography (Nielsen 2005) or incorporating demographic models into neutrality tests (e.g. Akey et al. 2004). The rationale of the latter approach is to build the neutral distribution of statistics on the basis of the specific demographic history of the population ⁄ species (ideally inferred with independent and neutral markers). Among coalescent-based methods, the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is being increasingly used because of its power and flexibility to explore complex ad hoc demographic scenarios with relatively low demands in terms of computation effort (Beaumont 2010). By considering explicit demographic scenarios, a wide range of patterns of polymorphism at candidate genes has been explained by purely historical changes in effective population size (e.g. for conifers, Heuertz et al. 2006; Pyha ̈ ja ̈ rvi et al. 2007; Holliday et al. 2010). On the other hand, the occasional finding of significant departure from these specific demographic frameworks hints at the functional importance of the target locus. Following this approach, examples of both positive and balancing selection in response to environmental drivers, such us drought or cold, have been documented in conifers (e.g. Eckert et al. 2010; Grivet et al. 2011), although proof of selection signatures in genes underlying defence mechanisms remains scarce (but see Ersoz et al. 2010).
In this study, we examine potentially functional variation at five genes involved in the biosynthesis of taxol in natural populations of T. baccata from the Iberian Peninsula. Our sample is a good representation of natural variation found in the western gene pool of the species (M. Mayol, unpublished data). Our main aims are (i) to describe the level and distribution of gene diversity and (ii) to find out which factors (demographic or adaptive) might be responsible for the observed nucleotide polymorphisms. We sampled populations under highly contrasted environmental conditions and geographically far off from each other within the Iberian Peninsula, a major hotspot of plant biodiversity (http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org). Applying different types of neutrality tests and accounting for population-specific demographic trends as inferred from neutral molecular markers using an ABC framework, we tested for evolutionary processes leading to the

Materials and methods
Plant material and DNA extraction
Five natural populations were chosen within the Iberian Peninsula to cover contrasting environmental conditions, in terms of altitude, soil, precipitations and temperature (e.g. from 556 to 1591 mm rainfall and 900–1700 m a.s.l. altitude; Fig. 2 and Table S1, Supporting information). Trees were georeferenced and marked using permanent labels. We collected needles from 28 to 48 individuals per population (n = 175) for nuclear microsatellite genotyping and about 10–20 seeds from each of eight female trees per population for candidate gene sequencing. A sample from a Japanese yew species (Taxus cuspidata) was used as outgroup. Genomic DNA was isolated from needles (diploid) and megagametophyte (haploid) tissues using
bases: TXS, T5aH, TAT, TBT and DBAT (Table 1). Primers were designed using PRIMERSELECT v.7 (DNASTAR Lasergene) on reference yew sequences from the NCBI GenBank. When sequences from T. baccata were not available (T5aH, TAT and TBT), the consensus from different Taxus species was used instead. Primer sequences and amplification conditions are reported in Table S2 (Supporting information). PCR products were purified with the ExoSAP purification kit (GE Healthcare), and sequencing was performed on ABI 3730 DNA Analyzers at an external service (Secugen, Madrid). Sequences were assembled, aligned and manually edited using SEQMAN v.7 (DNASTAR Lasergene) and BIOEDIT (http:// www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/page2.html). All sequence data have been deposited within the EMBL ⁄ GenBank Data Libraries under accession numbers JQ611228– JQ611268 and JQ618850–JQ618996. The use of haploid megagametophyte tissue for sequencing helps to rule out paralog coamplification, a common concern in species, such as the conifers, with large genomes (10 807 Mbp; Plant DNA C-values Database, release 5.0, June 2011, http://data.kew.org/cvalues/). Locus T5aH, however, exhibited double peaks in the chromatograms of some individuals and no segregating polymorphisms overall. Thus, to avoid the risk of including data from coamplified paralogs, we considered T5aH as effectively monomorphic in T. baccata and only fixed differences with the outgroup were used for further data analyses.
Seven specific nuclear microsatellites markers (Tax86, Tax23, Tax26, Tax31, Tax36, Tax60 and Tax92bis; Dubreuil et al. 2008) were genotyped in all populations, to

describe the geographical distribution of neutral diversity and to infer the demographic history of each yew population under the assumption of no selection. PCR amplification and electrophoresis protocols are described in Dubreuil et al. (2008). Genotyping was performed using a 96-capillary MEGABACE 1000 (GE Healthcare) automatic sequencer. Allele sizes were assessed according to the ET400-R size standards (GE Healthcare) using MEGABACE FRAGMENT PROFILER version 1.2 (GE Healthcare).
Protein functionality
We used the Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT algorithm, Ng & Henikoff 2001) to infer whether substitu-
tions in our sequences may be deleterious and hence potentially impair protein function. This algorithm compares a given amino acid sequence with a set of homologous protein sequences used as reference, assuming that important amino acids would be conserved in a protein family and taking into account their physical– chemical properties. For TAT and TBT, all possible homologous proteins from conifers were obtained from online databases (SWISS-PROT 56.6, TREMBL 39.6 and NCBI’s nonredundant 2008 protein database) and were used as reference proteins. TXS was tested against diterpene synthases identified in Table 1 in Keeling & Bohlmann (2006) and taxadiene synthases from Table 1 in Hao et al. (2008). Deacetylbaccatin transferases from Table 1 in Hao et al. (2008) were used as reference for DBAT

Gene polymorphism and divergence
To describe the level and distribution of polymorphism for each gene, the number of segregating sites (S), nucleotide diversity (p), between-species divergence (K), the ratios pa ⁄ ps (nonsynonymous-to-synonymous diversity) and Ka ⁄ Ks (nonsynonymous-to-synonymous divergence), as well as the effective number of codons (ENC; Wright 1990), were computed using DNASP v. 5.10 (Librado & Rozas 2009).
Patterns of within-species polymorphism and between-species divergence were compared within and among genes, to search for genes showing significant deviations from the neutral ratio of polymorphism to divergence and to identify specific regions where selection would have acted within genes. The Bayesian approach implemented in OMEGAMAP v. 0.5 (Wilson & McVean 2006) was used to explore the variation of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dn ⁄ ds = x) along each gene (codon values of x higher than 1 are considered to be driven by positive selection). We used a block-like model and uninformative priors following guidelines by the authors (Table S3, Support-
ing information). Two independent runs of 500 000 iterations were used to assure convergence. Parameter estimates were obtained from the two runs combined after discarding the first 10 000 steps as burn-in.
The McDonald–Kreitman (MK) test (McDonald & Kreitman 1991) was computed using the web-based Standard and Generalized MK-test software (Egea et al. 2008), assuming synonymous sites as effectively neutral. The test was performed separately within coding regions (i.e. nonsynonymous vs. synonymous sites) and between coding and noncoding regions (i.e. noncoding vs. synonymous sites) of each gene. Significance was assessed by a G-test. In addition, the proportion of gene divergence attributable to adaptive evolution, a, and its confidence interval was estimated with the maximum likelihood method of Bierne & Eyre-Walker (2004) implemented in the software DoFE v. 3.0 (using default settings). The Hudson–Kreitman–Aguade ́ (HKA) test (Hudson et al. 1987) was performed separately for different kinds of sites using the HKA program (distributed by Jody Hey, http://genfaculty.rutgers.edu/hey/software). We ran the test for all genes together and for all combinations of four out of five loci (i.e. removing a locus at a time) to show the relative contribution of each gene to the multilocus results. Neutral expectations and significance of the v2 statistic were assessed by 1000 coalescent simulations.

Population structure and demography
The geographical distribution of genetic diversity was examined in functional candidate genes and (putatively neutral) microsatellites. For each gene, amongpopulation differentiation (including InDels) was estimated by analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) on haplotype frequencies (FST) and on haplotype pairwise distances (FST) using ARLEQUIN v. 3.5.1.2 (Excoffier & Lischer 2010). For comparison, the value of differentiation for microsatellites (RST) was estimated with the same method. Significance was obtained by 1000 permutations. Neutral (i.e. based on nuclear microsatellites) population genetic structure was studied using the Bayesian clustering method implemented in the program STRUCTURE v. 2.2 (Pritchard et al. 2000). The admixture model with correlated frequencies was chosen, and the number of clusters was set from one to ten, to explore the possibility of substructure beyond the population level (as has been shown in other Iberian yew populations; Dubreuil et al. 2010). Five repetitions of 500 000 iterations with 10 000 burn-in were performed for each value of K and were averaged using CLUMPP (Jakobsson & Rosenberg 2007). The optimum number of clusters, K, was determined following guidelines by the authors (see user manual) and the simulation study by Evanno et al. (2005).
Microsatellite data were also used to infer the demographic history at regional and population scale via the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework implemented in DIYABC v. 1.0.4.36 (Cornuet et al. 2010). Briefly, this ABC implementation consists of three main steps. First, one million simulated data sets were produced under the given demographic model, with parameter values drawn from prior distributions. Each simulation is summarized by a number of summary statistics. In our study, we used all four summary statistics available for the one sample analysis in DIYABC: mean number of alleles, mean genic diversity, mean size variance and mean Garza–Williamson’s M (i.e. the ratio of the number of alleles to the range in allele size, a measure sensitive to population size reduction; Garza & Williamson 2001). Second, the 1% of simulations whose summary statistics were closest to the observed values of the same statistics were retained (rejection step). Third, retained simulations were used to infer posterior probability of parameters (by local linear regression). Then, a thousand posterior predictive simulations (generated under the model) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the demographic scenario, by comparing the observed values of summary statistics with their posterior distribution (i.e. to be sure that data are plausible under the inferred demographic history; Cornuet et al. 2010). In our study, a demo-
graphic model consisting of three periods of constant population size was used: N1, the population size at present, which changes (backwards) at time t to N2, the population size of the second period, which changes at time t + d to N3, the population size at the third period. This model allows simulating a variety of scenarios from expanding demography to population bottleneck with recent recovery. Prior distributions for parameters (Table S6, Supporting information) were chosen to allow a temporal interval spanning the two last glaciations (assuming a generational time of 50–100 years) and a wide range of population sizes. This choice is justified by the biological characteristics of the species (maturity age at 20–70 years, long life-span, pollen dispersal by wind) and its current and past distribution (known by pollen records and fossils, see Thomas & Polwart 2003; Gonza ́lez-Mart ́ınez et al. 2010). Indeed, based on historical records, it is plausible to hypothesize a reduction in population size during the last glaciations (12 000–110 000 and 300 000–450 000 BP). More recently, either population recovery because of restoration of favourable climatic conditions or further reduction because of human forest exploitation is possible. A generalized stepwise mutation model was assumed and default values were used for all prior mutation parameters except the mean mutation rate, for which a loguniform distribution was chosen (minimum 1.00E-4 and maximum 1.00E-3 mutations per generation). The ABC procedure was applied to each population separately to avoid confounding effects because of spatial genetic structure (see Results). In addition, analyses based on pooled population data (which are relatively common in the literature) are also given for comparative purposes.
Neutrality tests based on site frequency spectrum under inferred demography
For each gene, different statistics describing the site frequency spectrum (SFS), Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989) and standardized Fay and Wu’s Hn (Zeng et al. 2006), and the haplotype-based statistic Ewen–Watterson’s EW (Watterson 1978; Zeng et al. 2007b) were calculated per population and at the regional scale. Departure of these statistics from their expected value under a neutral scenario (that accounts for demography) can be interpreted as a signal of selection. Each of these statistics is sensitive in a different way to demographic processes and to background selection (Zeng et al. 2006). Therefore, to take advantage of their complementary features, we looked also at the compound tests DH (Zeng et al. 2006), HEW and DHEW (Zeng et al. 2007b), which have been shown to be more specific to detect positive selection and less affected by other

evolutionary forces. Significance levels were obtained for each gene and population using coalescent simulations that incorporate the demographic uncertainty (see above) to generate the simple and joint null distribution of D, Hn and EW. P-values of the compound tests were estimated as the proportion of simulations for which tests statistics D, Hn are lower and EW is higher than D*, Hn* and EW*, respectively, being D*, Hn* and EW* the values that correspond to the same significance level (a) for the single statistic test. This a level is chosen as the highest P-value among the single statistic tests. For instance, if P-values for D, Hn and EW tests were, respectively, 0.045, 0.001 and 0.001, the chosen value of a for the compound tests would be 0.045. D* would be the value that defines the 0.045 percentile in the set of D statistic values obtained by simulation of the neutral model (which would correspond to the observed experimental value of D), and Hn* and EW* would be values that defines the 0.045 percentile in the sets of Hn and EW values from the simulations (which would not correspond to the observed experimental values of Hn and EW). The approach taken in this work differs from the original implementation of the compound test, where a is fixed a priori (usually to 0.05) independently of the observed statistic values, and no P-value is reported.
For each population, the neutral scenario simulated to conduct neutrality tests was defined by the demographic history estimated by the ABC inference. For each coalescent simulation, parameter values (N1, N2, N3, t and d) were drawn from their joint posterior probability distribution and were rescaled to 4N1. Ten thousand replicates were simulated conditional to the number of segregating sites, S, and reproducing respective population sample sizes and sequenced gene lengths. Three values of recombination were assumed (q = 0 ⁄ 1 ⁄ 4), where q = 0 corresponds to a conservative scenario of no recombination, q = 1 to the minimum recombination value estimated in our data set (using LDHAT v. 2.1; McVean et al. 2002) and q = 4 to the maximum value reported for conifers in Jaramillo-Correa et al. (2010). Misorientation of the ancestral vs. derived status of alleles at polymorphic sites may affect the statistics based on the unfolded frequency spectrum (i.e. Hn). The probability of misorientations was estimated for each locus as in Baudry & Depaulis (2003), and their correction was incorporated in simulated data before calculating P-values. Simulated sequences were generated by ‘ms’ software (Hudson 2002). The whole SFSbased neutrality test analysis was performed in R (R Development Core Team, 2009) with custom scripts by the authors (available from C. Burgarella upon request) and using some functions from package ‘pegas’ (Paradis 2010).
Results
Gene polymorphism and divergence
Taxol-related candidate genes showed high overall nucleotide diversity (p), with one segregating site every 56 bp in the studied populations of T. baccata. Differences in polymorphism levels among genes were up to tenfold, TAT and TBT being the most and the least diverse polymorphic genes, respectively (Table 2). Very weak codon usage bias was found, with small differences among genes. In fact, the ENC was 54.33–57.86 (Table 2), within a potential range of 20–61 (maximum to no codon bias). As expected, overall nonsynonymous ⁄ synonymous diversity ratios, pa ⁄ ps, were lower than one (average of 0.18; Table 2), suggesting that nonsynonymous regions are under purifying selection in all genes, although some coding region could have relaxed constraint or be under other type of selective forces (e.g. TAT exon 1, with S = 7, exhibited a ratio very close to one; Table S5, Supporting information). Nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence, Ka ⁄ Ks, extended the polymorphism picture to the interspecific level, with an average Ka ⁄ Ks ratio lower than one (0.48) indicating a substantial number of amino acid-changing mutations subjected to negative selection. One gene, TBT, stood out from this general pattern with Ka ⁄ Ks > 1, a potential signature of adaptive divergence.
Interestingly, we found a large variation in the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratio x (dn ⁄ ds) along the functional regions of each gene. Although most codons had values of x lower than 1, some regions stood out with values of x higher than 1 in TXS, TAT and TBT, a clear signal of diversifying selection (Fig. 3).
In all genes, Ka ⁄ Ks was greater than pa ⁄ ps (i.e. there were more fixed replacement differences between species than expected), being up to twice higher for TAT and TBT. The MK test was significant for TAT (P-value = 0.033; Table 2), suggesting that nonsynonymous sites could be under positive selection in this gene. When applied to noncoding regions, the test was highly significant for TAT and TBT, pointing to a potential effect of positive selection on noncoding positions too. The MK test is based on the assumption that synonymous sites evolve under neutrality. To better understand the effect of this assumption, we repeated the test for TAT using only fourfold degenerated sites as neutral reference. The test was not significant anymore for noncoding regions (not shown). This suggests that weak purifying selection at twofold sites could have led to an overestimation of selection in other site categories in this gene (Akashi 1999; Wright & Andolfatto 2008). However, this result has to be considered with caution because it is based on a small number of fourfold sites. The mean value of a

Fig. 3 Variation of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dn ⁄ ds = x) along four taxol-related genes, estimated with the Bayesian approach of OMEGAMAP. Average block length was 20 codons for TXS (a), TAT (b) and DBAT (d) and 10 codons for TBT (c). The median (black line) and 95% credibility interval (grey-shaded area) of two combined runs of 500 000 iterations each are shown. The reference value x = 1 is represented with a dotted line (higher values of x hint at divergent selection). Note that the y axis is in log scale.
across genes (a = 0.68, CI 0.13–0.89) was broadly similar to those found for other plant species that are suggested to evolve under strong adaptive divergence (e.g. 􏰁75% in sunflowers, Strasburg et al. 2009; 􏰁40% in Capsella, Slotte et al. 2010). The multilocus HKA test showed significant departure from neutrality when all and noncoding sites were considered (P-values of 0.003 and 0.002, respectively) and was marginally significant for nonsynonymous sites (P-value = 0.090; Table S4, Supporting information). Two genes seemed to have uncoupled patterns of polymorphism and divergence, with opposite trends: for TBT, the higher than expected divergence suggested positive selection; for DBAT, the lower than expected divergence and the excess of polymorphism indicated the effect of balancing selection (Table S4, Supporting information). Conservative Bonferroni corrections for multiple testing rendered MK tests for coding regions nonsignificant but did not affect significance for noncoding regions or HKA tests.
For all genes, coding sequences may be considered to translate into fully functional proteins, as no potentially deleterious changes in amino acids were detected by SIFT.
Population structure and demography
Estimates of FST and FST indicated a moderate spatial genetic structure for taxol-related genes (mean FST = 0.18 and mean FST = 0.143), with a larger range in FST (from 0.11 to 0.29) than in FST (from 0.11 to 0.19),
suggesting that a spatial segregation of haplotypes may exist, particularly for TAT and TBT (Table 2). A similar value was obtained for genetic differentiation with neutral markers, RST = 0.141. Bayesian analysis at seven nuclear microsatellites showed that the finest level of genetic structure corresponded with the five sampled populations (Figs S1 and S2, Supporting information), as would be expected in consideration of the spatial pattern of neutral diversity described for the species at the wide range (Gonza ́lez-Mart ́ınez et al. 2010). In contrast with the Catalonian Mountain populations analysed by Dubreuil et al. (2010), no further population substructure was detected.
Demographic inferences using ABC were highly congruent across populations and for the species as a whole. Microsatellite data supported a scenario of strong reduction in effective population size (to 􏰁1%) for all populations, starting some 2000–3000 generations ago (i.e. c. 100 000–300 000 BP, assuming a generation time of 50–100 years) and continuing up to the present (Table S6, Supporting information). Figure 4 shows the posterior density distribution for the effective population sizes in function of time (‘skyline plot’) for single populations and all population data pooled.

purely demographic parameters itself; thus, populations were treated separately for neutrality tests based on the SFS that incorporate the demographic uncertainty as inferred by ABC. Results for demographic-explicit Tajima’s D, Fay and Wu’s Hn, DH, HEW and DHEW neutrality tests per locus and population are shown in Table 3. P-values estimated by coalescent simulations express the probability of rejection of neutrality under population-specific bottleneck scenarios. As expected, the increase in intragenic recombination made the tests less conservative (but more realistic), as it generally narrowed the simulated statistic distribution (see Tables 3 and S7, Supporting information). The estimated relative contribution of recombination to diversity (q ⁄ h) was low and similar for all genes (range 0–0.265, Table 2). Estimated probability of misorientation was zero for all genes but TXS (with a very low probability of 0.011), so that effects of misorientation on Hn statistics were considered negligible (not shown). A number of significant departures from neutral expectations were observed at single population tests, although the interpretation of such departures is not straightforward. For q = 0, only one locus-population combination (DBAT in Pineta, a high-altitude population in the Pyrenees) rejected the neutral scenario for all statistics, in most cases with marginal significance (Table S7, Supporting information). Looking at the compound tests, more powerful for the detection of positive selection (Zeng et al. 2006, 2007a,b), TBT in Agres (a Mediterranean population from eastern Spain) and DBAT in Pineta, would be consistent with an ongoing or recently completed selective
sweep, regardless of the level of recombination considered. However, applying conservative Bonferroni corrections to account for multiple tests, no test remained significant (not shown). At the species level (i.e. pooling data from all populations, as it is common practice in less structured species), despite significant population structure, significant departures from neutrality were not observed. In summary, observed nucleotide diversity patterns seem to be satisfactorily explained by the inferred recent bottlenecks, although adaptive divergence of some gene-population combinations cannot be fully discarded.
Discussion
We report on the natural genetic diversity and population differentiation of five main genes involved in the biosynthesis of taxol, a constitutive defensive metabolite of Taxus species with wide applications in anticancer therapies (Croteau et al. 2006). The European yew (T. baccata L.) naturally occurs in the Iberian Peninsula under much contrasted environmental conditions (see Fig. 2 and Table S1, Supporting information), and it is likely that local adaptation exists, as it has been well documented for other widespread temperate and Mediterranean conifers (e.g. Savolainen et al. 2007; Grivet et al. 2011) and, more in general, for plant species (see meta-analysis in Leimu & Fischer 2008). Unfortunately, an inestimable part of yew natural resources might get lost before it can be exhaustively investigated. In fact, our ABC analysis shows a clear trend of demographic

decline in the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 4), confirming previous warnings based on a number of ecological and silvicultural reports (reviewed in Thomas & Polwart 2003). Hence, our study responded to the necessity of examining extant patterns of natural gene diversity, to eventually identify genes and populations potentially worth of more thorough characterization. By looking at several gene features and using complementary approaches that are sensitive to evolutionary events at various time scales, marked differences among and within genes became evident, and we found diverse lines of evidence pointing to demographic and selective processes shaping genetic variation of Iberian yew populations.
Purifying selection appeared to be important in four of five taxol genes, as suggested by the higher diversity ⁄ divergence at synonymous relative to nonsynonymous sites (pa ⁄ ps £ 0.27, Ka ⁄ Ks £ 0.60). A general predominance of genome-wide purifying selection is normally observed for functionally important regions (see Wright & Andolfatto 2008 for a review; Palme ́ et al. 2009 for a conifer example). The prevalence of negative selection was already reported in TXS and DBAT by
Hao et al. (2008) using a phylogenetic approach. Here, we extended this observation to more recent time scales and to two other main genes of the taxol biosynthetic pathway, which allows some generalization of the findings. However, besides the interpretation in terms of negative selection, dn ⁄ ds and Ka ⁄ Ks lower than one can entangle more complex scenarios. In fact, values of x vary greatly along each gene, evidencing a few small regions likely under diversifying selection whereas most of the other codons seem under functional constraints (Fig. 3). In this context, Palme ́ et al. (2008) found in Pinus species that relatively low values of Ka ⁄ Ks (􏰁0.2 to 0.5) may correspond actually to molecular signatures of positive selection. In fact, positive, balancing or relaxed negative selection likely act on only few sites, so that their effect on divergence ratio may be masked by the effect of purifying selection that prevails on most sites.
Selective constraints varied substantially across taxol genes, and TXS appeared to be the most conserved one (Table 2). Genome-based analysis of protein evolution in Arabidopsis (Wright et al. 2004) and other eukaryotes (Wright & Andolfatto 2008) showed that the extent of
Ó 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

selective constraints can be related with the level of gene expression. Accordingly, the most expressed gene would be the taxadiene synthase (TXS). In agreement with this suggestion, relatively high levels of expression have been observed for this gene in comparison with the others (Jennewein et al. 2004), probably due to the fact that the taxadiene synthase is the upstream-specific enzyme responsible for the early formation of the taxane skeleton (Ramsay et al. 2009), which is common to all taxoids (Croteau et al. 2006). Despite TXS behaving neutrally overall, some domains of the protein (i.e. the glycosyl hydrolase-like domain and exons 10–13 active site) were found under strong purifying selection, suggesting that they could be essential for the enzyme function. This idea is also supported by the fact that these parts of the protein are highly conserved in terpene evolution (Trapp & Croteau 2001). In contrast, selective constraints seem to be relaxed in the diterpene sequence domain (CDIS, exons 2–4), which may not be required for function albeit possibly being involved in structural diversification of synthases (Trapp & Croteau 2001). For that part of the protein, evidence of positive selection and parallel evolution on some amino acids has been reported within the phylogeny of the genus by Hao et al. (2008). Strong selective constraints also affect exons 1 and 3 of T5aH (Table S5, Supporting information), the gene which is thought to promote the first of many possible oxygenation reactions on taxadiene (Croteau et al. 2006). Different levels of gene expression may affect codon usage bias and, consequently, the proportion of synonymous changes (see review in Hershberg & Petrov 2008). However, as we found very weak codon bias and very little difference among genes (Table 2), we consider that our estimates of polymorphism and divergence were not significantly affected.
Three genes (TBT, TAT and DBAT) exhibited patterns departing from neutrality and being consistent with selective pressures other than purifying selection in at least one of the analyses performed. As MK and HKA tests are more sensitive to old and repetitive events (Zhai et al. 2009), the detected signatures might reflect selective processes (directional for TBT and TAT, balancing for DBAT) acting at the time scale of divergence between T. baccata and T. cuspidata (occurring around 3–4 Ma according to Li et al. 2001). At a more recent temporal scale, selection might still be in action in genes TBT and DBAT, as supported by demography-explicit neutrality tests based on the SFS, at least for two of the populations studied (Pineta, a high-altitude population in the Pyrenees, and Agres, an eastern population under harsh Mediterranean climate). It is conceivable that genes involved in pathways with major adaptive roles experience frequent selective waves, not necessar-
ily with the same direction or intensity than older ones, in relation to local environmental drivers.
By means of independent neutral molecular data (i.e. nuclear microsatellites) and a flexible ad hoc demographic model, this study casts light on the recent evolutionary history of T. baccata in the Iberian Peninsula, which appeared to be characterized by a strong reduction in effective population size (Fig. 4). While this particular demography was accounted for in SFS-based neutrality tests, it was not explicitly included in polymorphism and divergence tests. As bottlenecks are expected to make selection less effective (McDonald & Kreitman 1991), uncoupled polymorphism–divergence ratios because of demographic reasons cannot be ruled out (Fay & Wu 2001). However, our MK analysis is likely to be conservative, as it has been shown with simulations that adaptive substitutions can be underestimated if a recent population bottleneck occurred (Eyre-Walker & Keightley 2009). Another potential source of bias in MK and HKA tests could be population structure, which effects have not been fully investigated yet. However, the results of neutrality tests performed for each population separately are highly congruent with those for the whole species (not shown), and thus, we believe population structure effects to be negligible in our case. Finally, low divergence with the outgroup could be a reason for lack of power in MK and HKA tests (but see Zhai et al. 2009). Unluckily, this issue might be challenging to address in yew species. Because taxane biosynthesis is virtually exclusive of the Taxus genus, in outer taxa, similar genes may not be orthologous, while within the genus most of the taxolrelated genes are relatively similar at the molecular level (Croteau et al. 2006). Our attempts to sequence the same genes in a related taxon (genus Cephalotaxus) were unsuccessful.
The patterns that emerged for TAT, TBT and DBAT are compatible with the main scenarios foreseen for the evolution of defence genes. In fact, positive and balancing selection are the leading forces that shape coevolution of host and feeding ⁄ pathogen interactions (under the ‘arm-race’ and ‘trench warfare’ hypotheses, respectively; de Meaux & Mitchell-Olds 2003). Interestingly, also purifying selection or the combination of different modes of selection has been described for defence genes (Tiffin & Moeller 2006), including some tree species. For instance, Ersoz et al. (2010) found some genes under positive selection and others under strong negative selection among several disease candidate loci studied in Pinus taeda. Ingvarsson (2005) reported evidence for the coexistence of directional and divergent selection in the trypsin inhibitor TI1, a gene involved in the response to herbivore attacks in Populus tremula. However, the patterns of nucleotide polymorphism are shaped not

only by the type and strength of selective pressures but also by the way they are modified in time and space by several other abiotic and biotic factors external to the enemy–host relationship. Thus, high temporal and geographical heterogeneity is expected to characterize the molecular genetic configuration in hosts and enemies, producing patterns that may not differ from neutral expectations (de Meaux & Mitchell-Olds 2003), as those we found for TXS.
Notwithstanding, alternative scenarios of defence gene evolution not directly involving natural selection cannot be fully excluded. It has been shown that metapopulation dynamics and geographical structure may be the governing forces that produce and maintain high gene polymorphism in resistance genes (Thrall & Burdon 2002). On the other hand, it would be difficult to justify the significant metabolic cost (at the expense of reproduction and growth; Gershenzon 1994) required to produce the large number of naturally coexisting terpenes, which have high molecular weights, without invoking any adaptive significance. In the particular case of conifers, implication of terpenes in the response to pathogens has been extensively shown (Keeling & Bohlmann 2006), and upregulation of several conifer terpenoid genes has been found in transcriptional patterns following wounding by herbivores (e.g. Ralph et al. 2006).
Remarkably, more than 360 structurally diverse compounds can be naturally synthesized within the same universal taxane pathway. The majority are the result of multiple competing side-routes and dead-ends that diverge early in the route, presumably just after the hydroxylation promoted by the T5aH (i.e. involving hydroxylation and acylation steps parallel to those promoted by TAT, TBT and DBAT; Croteau et al. 2006). The extremely variable taxane composition and relative contents reported among species (e.g. Dempsey & Hook 2000; and van Rozendaal et al. 2000), populations (e.g. Hook et al. 1999) and genotypes (e.g. Parc et al. 2002) has not any clear systematic relation with phylogenetic, functional or ecological factors. It would certainly deserve further investigations to ascertain whether natural selection acting on TAT, TBT and DBAT is involved in the evolution of a differential taxane assortment among species or populations, and whether particular genotypes for these genes are responsible of specific diterpene products. Mutagenesis studies, limited to some terpene synthases up to now, have shown that single or multiple mutations throughout the enzyme can affect the diversity of products (e.g. Keeling et al. 2008 and references therein). Furthermore, significant association has been found between allelic variants of terpene genes and metabolite concentrations in leaves of Eucalyptus globulus (Ku ̈lheim et al. 2011). It is tanta-
lizing to ponder on the possibility that gene polymorphisms resulting from natural coevolutionary processes in European yew, a well-known element of Eurasian ecosystems, may have resulted in new variants of utility in biomedicine that remain undiscovered, given the high environmental variation covered by the species.
This is the first study that applies a population genetic approach to address the molecular diversity of main genes involved in the biosynthesis of taxol, a natural defence metabolite in yew species and worldleading anticancer agent. The knowledge about the patterns of genetic variation is the first step towards the identification of extant populations or genotypes worth of further study. In fact, allelic diversity is expected to be responsible of differences among populations and individuals in the amount of important metabolites or in the type of compounds (i.e. variants of the main molecules). We were able to identify three genes (TAT, TBT and DBAT) that may have experienced positive or balancing selection, as a probable result of coevolutionary processes with pests and feeders, and to evaluate the relative selective constraint among functional regions within each gene. Thanks to increasing genomic resources and high-throughput technology, even for nonmodel species (see review in Stapley et al. 2010), extending the sampling and screening to more genome regions (including other functional classes of defence genes) are envisaged to confirm and widen the current results and to reach a better comprehension of the genetic bases of taxane variation. With these objectives in mind, de novo transcriptome sequencing is in progress in European yew. Ecological analyses are also currently under way; they will help to understand if environmental components contribute to the spatial distribution of observed gene variation among populations and individuals. However, functional and biochemical analyses would also be necessary in the future to complete the picture on the evolution of taxane compounds, in particular for those amenable to biomedical applications.
