Abstract
One of the main questions in evolutionary and conservation biology is how geographical and environmental features of the landscape shape neutral and adaptive genetic variation in natural populations. The identification of genomic polymorphisms that account for adaptive variation can aid in finding candidate loci for local adaptation. Consequently, a comparison of spatial patterns in neutral markers and loci under selection may help disentangle the effects of gene flow, genetic drift and selection at the landscape scale. Many amphibians breed in wetlands, which differ in environmental conditions and in the degree of isolation, enhancing the potential for local adaptation. We used microsatellite markers to measure genetic differentiation among 17 local populations of Rana arvalis breeding in a network of wetlands. We found that locus RC08604 deviated from neutral expectations, suggesting that it is a good candidate for directional selection. We used a genetic network analysis to show that the allele distribution in this locus is correlated with habitat characteristics, whereas this was not the case at neutral markers that displayed a different allele distribution and population network in the study area. The graph approach illustrated the genomic heterogeneity (neutral loci vs. the candidate locus for directional selection) of gene exchange and genetic divergence among populations under directional selection. Limited gene flow between wetlands was only observed at the candidate genomic region under directional selection. RC08604 is partially located inside an up-regulated thyroid-hormone receptor (TRb) gene coordinating the expression of other genes during metamorphosis and appears to be linked with variation in larval life-history traits found among R. arvalis populations. We suggest that directional selection on genes coding larval life-history traits is strong enough to maintain the divergence in these genomic regions, reducing the effective recombination of locally adapted alleles but not in other regions of the genome. Integrating this knowledge into conservation plans at the landscape scale will improve the design of management strategies to preserve adaptive genetic diversity in wetland networks.

Introduction
Preservation of adaptive genetic variation and the capacity to generate novel variation are crucial measures for the successful long-term conservation of natural populations (Ferrie` re et al. 2004; Ho ̈ glund 2009). Although genetic variability is often less critical for population persistence than factors like habitat loss or fragmentation (Lande 1988), it can play a decisive role in the long term by enabling populations to adapt and persist in a changing environment. With decreasing genetic diversity, many species face higher vulnerability to extinction, given the increasing pace of anthropogenic impact on populations and their habitats (Frankham et al. 2002; Spielman et al. 2004).
Neutral genetic markers are currently the most common tool used to assess spatial population structure, gene flow and to identify conservation units (Hoffmann & Willi 2008) under the assumption that they accurately reflect adaptive variation (Kohn et al. 2006), but genetic variation in neutral markers can provide an incomplete picture of adaptive variation and the evolutionary potential of populations (e.g. Bekessy et al. 2003; Hoffmann et al. 2003). The lack of molecular divergence among populations at neutral loci is potentially uninformative as it cannot exclude variation in adaptive genetic traits and local adaptation processes (Lynch 1996; Va ̈li et al. 2008; Chapman et al. 2009). A growing body of studies on diverse taxa highlight phenotypic divergence among populations in the absence of neutral genetic divergence, suggesting that local adaptation between contrasting environments can evolve even in presence of gene flow when local selection is strong (e.g. Koskinen et al. 2002; Yeaman & Jarvis 2006).
In subdivided populations with gene flow, only genomic regions linked to locally adaptive traits diverge quickly under selection and become resistant to gene exchange during the first stage of ecological differentiation (Via & West 2008). At this stage of population differentiation, genomic regions not linked to phenotypic traits under selection may still be homogenized by ongoing gene flow (but see Rolshausen et al. 2009). The resulting heterogeneous genome (Via 2009) reduces the utility of neutral molecular markers among sympatric or closely located populations as they provide little insight into adaptive variation. Managing subdivided populations at a regional scale implies a compromise between the maintenance of the highest possible levels of genetic diversity for the whole set of populations, and the preservation of genetic differentiation or local adaptations among subpopulations (Ferna ́ ndez et al. 2008). While this requirement involves the design of subpopulation networks to allow genetic connections among populations (Crandall et al. 2000), the informa-
tion provided by neutral markers may not allow researchers to estimate the extent to which the populations’ adaptive potential will be reduced by the loss of habitats and genetic diversity.
Recent methodological advancements have made it possible to detect loci under selection in natural populations (e.g. Beaumont & Balding 2004; Riebler et al. 2008; Excoffier et al. 2009). Locus-specific estimates of FST may reveal genomic regions that have been under selection, assuming that all autosomal loci have experienced the same demographic history of expansions and contractions, similar mutation rates and comparable rates of migration among populations. Loci with unusually high levels of differentiation are likely to have been subjected to directional selection, whereas loci with low levels of differentiation have been constrained by stabilizing selection (Beaumont & Balding 2004; Holsinger & Weir 2009). Correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies can arise when the intensity of selection varies spatially (Fig. 1a, b; Novembre & Di Rienzo 2009). Consequently, by combining data from environmental variables, neutral genetic markers and adaptive loci, we can gain important insights into adaptation processes, which can aid the identification of conservation units. Using network methods (population graphs; Dyer & Nason 2004) for analysing how neutral and adaptive genetic variation is structured by geographical and environmental features may allow us to detect the strength of local selection against migrants or hybrids for selected phenotypic traits. Differences in population connectedness between the networks can demonstrate the effect of selection acting over different genomic regions. Tracking adaptive loci across environments can improve both our knowledge on adaptive diversity and the conservation guidelines that aim to preserve the long-term adaptive potential of populations at the landscape scale (Smith et al. 2005).
One of the primary causes of the global amphibian decline is habitat loss by destruction of breeding habitats and fragmentation of the surrounding terrestrial matrix (Gibbs 2000; Stuart et al. 2004). Management plans and wetland restoration projects often involve the creation of new ponds to maintain the metapopulation structure (Hecnar & M’Closkey 1996; Semlitsch 2002). Behavioural and genetic studies in natural or rural areas have demonstrated that movements between ponds occur at such high rates that local pond populations do not show significant demographic or genetic independence if breeding sites are not isolated by fragmentation (Petranka et al. 2004; Jehle et al. 2005). For this reason, groups of ponds and wetland networks are proposed as a more meaningful unit of management than individual wetlands (Fortuna et al. 2006; Petranka

 Fig. 1 The allele frequency dynamics (a non-neutral locus in grey, a neutral locus in black) in a population under directional selection (a, b) or stabilizing selection (c), and the relationship between FST for the locus under selection and differentiation along an environmental gradient. Environmental differentiation represents how different two localities are in abiotic or biotic variables. We consider a simple situation in which a fitness-related trait is governed by a locus, for which alternative alleles are favoured in different environments, with the allele frequency varying according to the selective pressure across the environments. Upper row shows the relative fitness of genotypes across the environments, the middle row the allele frequencies across the environments, and the bottom row the FST for the locus under selection in relation to environmental distances. In (a), the allele is fixed in the environment where it is favoured and absent where it is disadvantageous. In ecologically contrasted environments, selection eliminates alleles related with low local fitness, creating an abrupt transition between environments and generating a sigmoid curve between genetic distances and environmental difference. In (b), environmental difference among patches is gradual, and transition of the alleles between being advantageous or disadvantageous is also gradual. Genetic differentiation between populations increases linearly across the environmental gradient, in contrast with the abrupt change expected in case (a). (c) When local stabilizing selection is constant across environments, allele frequencies are constant across populations with low FST values. In the case of stabilizing selection, genetic differentiation is not correlated either with environmental variables or with environmental differences among populations.

& Holbrook 2006). On the other hand, amphibians often show strong adaptive differentiation in larval lifehistory traits among closely located wetlands with different environmental conditions (Skelly 2004; Van Buskirk & Arioli 2005; Meier 2007; Orizaola & Laurila 2009; Richter-Boix et al. 2010). This suggests that restoration projects should implement network designs that preserve habitat heterogeneity in order to preserve the genetic diversity (Petranka & Holbrook 2006).
In this study, we illustrate the utility of combining information from ecological data, neutral genetic markers and candidate loci for conservation purposes. We tested the neutrality of 15 microsatellite loci among 17 local populations (i.e. breeding sites) of moor frog Rana arvalis (Nilsson 1842). These breeding sites differ in hydroperiod, forest canopy, water temperature and predator abundance. Previous experimental studies
have demonstrated the adaptive value of local-scale genetic differentiation in amphibian larval life-history traits, like larval period or growth rate, in response to these environmental traits (Skelly 2004; Van Buskirk & Arioli 2005; Meier 2007; Orizaola & Laurila 2009; Richter-Boix et al. 2010). If directional selection among the environments is strong, regions of the genome with a functional importance should exhibit extreme levels of differentiation relative to neutral loci and can be identified by outlier detection approaches (Beaumont & Balding 2004). We predict that, at a fine-grained spatial scale with contrasted habitats, neutral and non-neutral loci will exhibit three different patterns: (i) Under directional selection and in an environment heterogeneous enough to maintain differentiation between populations in the presence of gene flow, we expect to find a positive correlation between the degree of genetic

differentiation and the level of environmental differentiation between breeding sites. With directional local selection, the spread of an advantageous allele, together with the selection against disadvantageous alleles, is expected to lead to a loss of genetic variation. The relationship between allele frequency and environmental differentiation will vary according to variation in selection intensity (Fig. 1a, b). (ii) Alternatively, stabilizing selection across environments can lead to constant allele frequencies over environments resulting in the absence of correlation between FST and environment (Fig. 1c). Finally, (iii) assuming that dispersal and related gene flow is a fixed parameter independent of the strength of divergent selection or the phenotypes of potential disperses (Lenormand 2002), neutral markers are predicted to show an Isolation By Distance pattern (IBD). In this case, genetic differentiation will increase as a function of geographical distance but not necessarily with increasing environmental difference. As a consequence of directional selection (i) and genetic drift (iii), we expect to find different patterns of network connections among populations depending on whether we use neutral or non-neutral markers. A population graph creates networks of genetic variation containing the smallest link set among localities that sufficiently explains the genetic covariance structure among sites (see Material and Methods for more details). Specifically, we expect to observe a higher number of connections among similar environments and fewer connections among different environments for loci under directional selection than for neutral markers, creating two sub-graphs with networks according to the habitats.
Material and methods
Genotype sampling and molecular analyses
We surveyed a 40 · 40 km area located within Uppsala and Enko ̈ping municipalities in Uppsala county, central Sweden. The area is flat terrain dominated by a mixture of forests, pastures and agricultural fields. Forests consist of mixed Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies stands of different ages, scattered with deciduous trees (mainly Betula, Populus, Alnus). In April 2008, we sampled R. arvalis embryos at 17 breeding ponds. Distances between the ponds ranged from 1.5 to 41 km (average distance between localities 􏰁19 km). Location coordinates were determined using a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit (Garmin etrex Legend HCX) (Fig. 2). In each pond we collected, when possible, 􏰁10 eggs from each of 30 freshly laid clutches (see Table 1 for sample size in each pond). The embryos were transported to the laboratory where they hatched and were then preserved in 70% ethanol and stored at 5 °C until DNA extraction. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 427 hatchlings (1 individual ⁄ clutch) using a high-salt precipitation protocol. Purity and concentration of DNA were determined with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and DNA integrity was verified by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Fifteen previously published microsatellite loci isolated for different Rana species were tested in this study. According to their respective bibliographic sources, some of these loci were obtained after standard enrichment procedures, whereas others were designed from microsatellite-containing sequences available from

the EMBL and GenBank databases (Garner & Tomio 2001; Rowe & Beebee 2001; Vos et al. 2001; Arens et al. 2007). Some of these loci are located near coding regions or primers anchor in coding areas (see Table 2 for further information), increasing the probability of these markers of being under selection.
Multiplexed PCR amplifications were performed in a final volume of 10 lL containing some 50 ng DNA template, 5 lL PCR mix (QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Kit), 1 lL 10· primer mix, and 3 lL RNAse-free water in an Applied Biosystems Gene Amp PCR Systems 2700 thermal cycler. PCR profiles consisted of 15 min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 30–38 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 °C, 90 s annealing at 50–55 °C and 90sextensionat72°Cwithafinalstepof7minat 72 °C. PCR products were genotyped on a MegaBACE 1000 automatic sequencer (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and scoring was performed using the software FRAGMENT PROFILER (Fragment Profiler 1.2, Amersham Biosciences, 2003).
Local environmental variation
We selected the wetlands included in this study based on three criteria: First, the geological and physical structure of the wetland, distinguishing between marshes and ponds. The second criterion was the amount of forest canopy; we selected wetlands with open or (partly) closed canopy cover. The third criterion was hydroperiod length during tadpole development. Water permanency was assessed visiting the locations twice, in mid-June and early July, and breeding sites were classified as temporary if they desiccated completely before tadpoles reached metamorphosis. Water depth was measured in the deepest part of the basin (with the exception of some deeper ponds, which were assigned a depth of >150 cm) during breeding season just after snowmelt. Surface water temperature data were automatically collected at 15-min intervals with temperature data loggers (HOBO Water Temp Pro v2 Data Logger) from the start of the breeding until mid-July. Forest canopy was estimated visually by the same person into 10% categories. The proportional coverage of emergent vegetation was estimated along five transects by line intercept. Macroinvertebrate predators and adult newts were sampled in mid-June and early July by conducting five dipnet sweeps in five sites in each wetland (a total of 25 dip-net samples at each wetland). Predator densities were determined on a volume basis, using the dimensions of the net frame (diameter 32 cm; mesh size: 0.08 cm) and the distance walked (3–5 m).
To avoid problems of multicollinearity among environmental variables during statistical analyses, the habitat variables were encapsulated into two principal
components. The standardized habitat variables were submitted to a component analysis technique for mixtures of quantitative and qualitative variables using ‘dudi.mix’ function in ADE4 package for R (Chessel et al. 2004). Standardization of environmental variables was performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by two standard deviations. Lentic systems range along a continuous gradient determined by abiotic and biotic factors (Wellborn et al. 1996), and we reduced this variability to two habitat categories. We partitioned the habitats into two clusters with the k-means clustering method on the first two component vectors obtained in the principal component analysis, using the ‘kmeans’ function in R Stats package for R. This method is an unsupervised learning algorithm that classifies the data set to a certain number of clusters (k = 2 in our case) by defining k centroids for each cluster. Centroids change their location step-by-step until no more changes are done, producing k different clusters and maximizing the difference between the clusters. These two habitat groups were used in the genetic network analyses.
Wetlands at adjacent geographical locations can resemble each other because of spatial autocorrelation, which can violate the assumption of independence of the values of the variables and confound the patterns of IBD and local adaptation. We therefore quantified the spatial pattern of habitat variation with a Moran’s I correlogram by plotting the Moran’s I coefficients against distance between localities. Absence of spatial autocorrelation can be identified when Moran’s I coefficients are close to zero. We estimated Moran’s I coefficient at particular lag distances chosen to keep a constant number of sample pairs within each class. The significance of Moran’s I was assessed using Monte Carlo randomization. As several coefficients were calculated in both correlograms, the coefficient was considered statistically significant after a Bonferroni-correction for multiple testing. These analyses were conducted using the SPDEP package in R with 2000 Monte Carlo randomization permutations.
Statistical analyses of population genetic data
Observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity were estimated using GENALEX 6.0 (Peakall & Smouse 2006) for each population-by-locus combination and then averaged over all loci to produce population estimates. Linkage disequilibrium between pairs of microsatellite loci and departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) within each sample and locus were evaluated with a Markov chain approximation (10 000 dememorizations, 1000 batches, and 10 000 iterations per batch) of the Fisher’s exact test performed in Genepop 4.0 (Raymond & Rousset 1995).

tested by using two alternative hypotheses, deficiency and excess of heterozygotes, for each locus and across all loci and populations using Fisher’s method. Associated probability values were corrected for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni adjustment for a significance level of 0.05. Potential genotyping errors such as presence of null alleles, stuttering and allelic dropouts were analysed using MICRO-CHECKER 2.2.3 (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004). When null alleles were detected, corrected allele frequencies for each locus and population containing null alleles were estimated using the Brookfield Estimator 2 under the assumption that the nonamplified samples represent null allele homozygotes. All estimates of population differentiation were carried out using both non-adjusted and adjusted data. As the results and biological interpretation were similar, we present the results on the original data, unless otherwise specified. The Bottleneck program (Cornuet & Luikart 1996) was used to determine if any signal of a past bottleneck could be detected. Bottlenecked populations are predicted to show an excess of heterozygosity, as the number of alleles is more severely affected by a decrease in population size than heterozygosity. Expected values were determined using the two-phase mutation model, because it is probably closer to the true mode of mutation in microsatellite loci than other mutation models (Piry et al. 1999). Model options were set to 80% single-step mutations, a variance among multiple steps of 20, and 3000 iterations. The probability of significant heterozygosity excess was determined using the Wilcoxon’s signed rank test as recommend by Piry et al. (1999).
Outlier detection
A growing number of statistical approaches are available to identify putative non-neutral loci (e.g. Joost et al. 2007). ‘Outlier’ loci that show deviating patterns from neutrality, thus possibly carrying the signature of natural selection, were detected using three different analyses to reduce the risk of detecting false positives as far as possible. First, we used two population genetic approaches: (i) the Beaumont & Nichols (1996) Fdist approach, implemented in LOSITAN (Antao et al. 2008) and (ii) the hierarchical Bayesian method described in Beaumont & Balding (2004) improved in the BAYESCAN software (Foll & Gaggiotti 2008). Both of them are based on the straightforward principle that genetic differentiation among populations in contrasting environments is expected to be different for loci under selection than for the rest of the genome. LOSITAN uses coalescent simulations to generate a null distribution of FST values based on an infinite island model for the populations and an infinite allele model or a stepwise mutation
model for polymorphism. Loci with an unusually high FST are putatively under directional selection, while loci with low FST value are considered to be potentially under stabilizing selection. In this study, we simulated the neutral distribution of FST with 100 000 iterations at a significance P value of 0.005 to avoid the risk of overestimation of the effects of selection. Runs were performed using the two possible mutation models: the stepwise mutation model, most commonly applied for microsatellite markers (Valde ́s et al. 1993), and the infinite allele model. BAYESCAN is based on a logistic regression model in which each logit value of genetic differentiation FST (i, j) for locus i in population j is decomposed as a linear combination of the coefficients of the logistic regression, ai and bj, corresponding, respectively, to a locus effect and to a population effect. The posterior probability of locus i being under selection is estimated by defining two alternative models, one that includes ai and another that excludes it. The respective posterior probabilities of these two models are estimated using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) approach. The posterior probability that a locus is subject to selection is then estimated from the RJMCMC output by counting the times that ai is included in the model. BAYESCAN was used on the 17 populations running 250 000 iterations.
The main difference between the two methods is that LOSITAN assumes that populations are at driftmigration equilibrium, which is unrealistic in most natural situations. The main advantage of BAYESCAN in this context is that it estimates population-specific FST coefficients, allowing for different demographic histories and different amounts of genetic drift between the populations. Both methods are Bayesian approaches that estimate the posterior probability of each locus being under selection, but whereas Fdist uses a cut-off value based on a user-defined false-positive rate (e.g. 1% of false positive with a threshold of 99%), BAYESCAN uses a cut-off based on the mode of the posterior distribution (Foll & Gaggiotti 2008). Outliers detected by both methods are likely to be good candidate regions, because the two approaches use different assumptions and algorithms (Paris et al. 2010; Pe ́ rez-Figueroa et al. 2010).
We complemented these analyses with a third method to further strengthen our analyses. We used the Spatial Analysis Method (SAM) described by Joost et al. (2007), based on an evaluation of the incidence of spatial or environmental coincidence. Unlike the previous two methods, SAM does not require defining of the populations and identifies alleles associated with environmental variables. However, it requires to be combined with the aforesaid methods to differentiate between directional or stabilizing selection. For the

analyses, we constructed a matrix where each row corresponds to an individual and the environmental information where it was sampled, whereas the columns contain a binary information (1 or 0) indicating the presence or absence of a given allele at the loci explored. We used two environmental variables per individual: the first component vector (CS1) extracted from the principal component analysis, and the two habitat categories obtained from the clustering analysis (forest marshes or open pond). SAM calculates logistic regressions between all possible marker-environmental pairs and determines whether a model including an environmental variable is more informative than a model including only the constant by comparing them. Statistical testing is based on the log-likelihood function in two different tests: G statistic and the Wald test (Jost 2008). We considered a model significant only if the two tests rejected the corresponding null hypothesis at the 95 and 99.999% confidence level after Bonferroni correction.
Relationship between genetic distances and geographical and environmental distances
We estimated three different FST matrices to assess the extent of genetic differentiation among breeding-ponds by computing pairwise Wright’s F-statistics using: (i) only the neutral loci, (ii) the locus under directional selection, and (iii) the loci under stabilizing selection detected in the previous analysis. Pairwise FST were estimated according to the method of Weir & Cockerham (1984), and significance was tested with 10 000 permutations using GENALEX (Peakall & Smouse 2006). In response to recent concerns raised about the reliability of FST in highly polymorphic systems (Jost 2008; Ryman & Leimar 2009), we also calculated Jost’s (2008) D for the neutral data subset, using Software for the Measurement of Genetic Diversity (SMOGD; Crawford 2010) with 1000 replicates in the bootstrapped parameters.
The relationships among genetic distance, local environmental conditions and geographical distances were examined using Mantel and Partial Mantel tests. To evaluate our hypothesis that IBD can explain the genetic patterns found in neutral markers, we tested for correlation between the pairwise genetic and geographical distances using a Mantel test. We transformed the F-statistics and D of neutral markers into FST ⁄ (1)FST), whereas logarithm of Euclidean distance between ponds was used for geographical distance following a two-dimensional model (Rousset 1997). To detect a signature of local adaptation, we correlated the genetic distance of non-neutral loci with environmental distance, using Mantel and Partial Mantel tests considering geographical distance as a third matrix. Environmental
distances were calculated as the Euclidean pairwise difference on the first two component vectors obtained in the principal component analysis of breeding site characteristics (Legendre & Legendre 1998; Me ́ ndez et al. 2010). All Mantel and partial Mantel tests were performed with 10 000 randomizations using the package ‘vegan’ implemented in R (Oksanen et al. 2009).
Population graph approach
We performed a network analysis to investigate network structure and genetic connectivity among breeding sites for the neutral loci and the loci under selection. Graph theory is an area of mathematics dealing with connectivity and flow in networks with applications ranging across many disciplines. Recently, it has become particularly useful in population genetics and landscape ecology (Dyer & Nason 2004; Garroway et al. 2008). A graph can represent a landscape of discrete habitat patches as a set of nodes (breeding sites) genetically interconnected by edges (gene flow) between them (Minor & Urban 2007). A Population Graph is a network modelled from the conditional genetic covariance structure among localities. Site pairs exchanging migrants will exhibit significant conditional covariance and will be connected in the network by edges, the length of which is inversely proportional to the genetic covariance between sites. Conversely, sites not directly exchanging migrants are likely to exhibit conditional independence and are not connected to each other in the network by edges, as the absence of direct gene flow allows them to proceed on evolutionary trajectories that are independent, given the set of intervening populations through which they exchange migrants (Dyer et al. 2010). We applied a multivariate population graphing approach (Dyer & Nason 2004; Garroway et al. 2008) to compare the genetic networks generated by neutral and non-neutral markers (considering the six neutral markers together or separately) and to determine which habitats constitute distinct genetic clusters. The networks were constructed using POPULATION GRAPHS V2 (http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu/software/) and the analyses were performed with Genetic Studio (Dyer 2009). For the graph construction, we retained the minimal edge set that sufficiently described the total amongpopulation covariance structure. Two sites will share an edge if there is significant genetic covariance between the sites after removing the covariance each population has with all the remaining populations in the network. Significance was evaluated using edge exclusion deviance, which identifies the most important edges for each node in terms of genetic covariance.

method for constructing graphs, see Dyer & Nason (2004) and references therein.
A binomial test for the existence of two subgraphs within the data set (Dyer & Nason 2004; Giordano et al. 2007) was used for each network to determine whether there was restricted gene flow between the two habitat categories determined by the clustering analysis. In partially reproductively isolated populations, we expect to find two subgraphs for the loci under directional selection but not for the neutral ones or for loci under stabilizing selection. As graphs generated by the non-neutral and neutral markers differed in the number of loci, we investigated the effect of the number of loci in the subgraph analyses by comparing results obtained when using the six neutral markers together or individually.
Across the entire Population Graph, conditional genetic distance (cGD) was estimated as the length of the shortest path connecting pairs of sites (nodes). Relative to the traditional measures of pairwise genetic distance, FST and D, cGD is more sensitive as it is calculated based upon the differences in genetic covariance associated with both direct and indirect gene flow among populations, rather than assuming a simple stepping stone framework and that gene flow is a homogeneous function of spatial distance, as in traditional IBD approaches (Dyer et al. 2010). These pairwise cGDs were regressed on geographical distance to test for isolation by distance, also called Isolation By Graph Distance (IBGD). This test allows us to detect the existence of genetic barriers to gene flow among populations. Assuming a homogeneous IBD process, cGD and spatial distances should be proportional, but the relationship between expected edge length and spatial distance may change if migration is heterogeneous. The relatively small cGD between spatially distant sites indicates long-distance migration (extended edges). Conversely, geographical or ecological barriers that impede migration relative to other localities with similar distance generate relatively higher cGD (compressed edges; Dyer et al. 2010). Correlations were determined using Mantel tests, while the detection of extended and compressed edges were calculated using Genetic Studio (Dyer 2009).
Results
Local environmental variation
The investigated wetlands were environmentally heterogeneous with 59% of the sites being classified as marshes and 41% as ponds a priori in the field. Approximately 90% of the marshes dried before midJuly, whereas 85% of the ponds retained water until July, demonstrating a strong relationship between wet-
land type and hydroperiod. The extraction of the two principal components explained 96% of the variance in habitat characters (Table S1, Supporting information). Both factors indicated differentiation from shallow forest marshes with abundant emergent vegetation, low water temperature and relatively few predators, to open ponds with little emergent vegetation, higher water temperature and many predators. The autocorrelation analysis for both habitat components showed that habitat variation was spatially heterogeneous without any clear pattern, with low Moran’s I coefficient values in both cases (Table S2, Supporting information). The k-clustering method determined seven sites in the first category (that we called forest marshes habitats) and 10 in the second one (open pond habitats).
Analyses of genetic variation
The loci RlatCa17, RlatCa18, RtCa9, RtCa25 and RNTYR2 were discarded as they either failed to amplify or produced ambiguously scored patterns, whereas locus RRD590 was excluded as it was monomorphic. Nine loci were retained for further analyses (Table S4, Supporting information): WRA1_22, WRA1_28, WRA1_160, WRA6_8, RC08604, RtCa11, RCIDII, Recalq and RlatCa41.
Observed heterozygosity ranged between 0.576 and 0.734, and expected heterozygosity from 0.598 to 0.697 (Table 1). Three populations (Deme4, Deme10 and Deme14) exhibited significant deviations towards excess homozygosity when testing for deviations from HWE (Table S3, Supporting information). Only one comparison between loci (WRA1_28 and WRA6_8) was significant for linkage disequilibrium when all the populations were pooled.
Micro-Checker suggested presence of null alleles for the locus Recalq in all populations, for RC08604 in eight of the 17 populations and in one population for the loci WRA1_28 and WRA6_8 (Table S4, Supporting information). However, these loci were retained for subsequent analyses after correcting allele frequencies using the Brookfield Estimator 2, assuming that the most common cause of microsatellite null alleles arises from point mutations in the sequence flanking the repeat region thus hampering or preventing primer annealing (Lehmann et al. 1996). The presence of null alleles can lead to the overestimation of FST in cases of significant population differentiation (Chapuis & Estoup 2007), which is not the case in our study (Table S7a, Supporting information). The results of the gene flow analysis remained similar when analysing the data set that included all neutral loci and when the null alleles were removed, or when using FreeNA (Chapuis & Estoup 2007), which uses the ENA correction method for the bias induced

by the presence of null alleles on FST estimation (results not shown). A low rate of null alleles can have a negligible impact on many type of analysis, only causing serious biases in genetic parentage assessments (Dakin & Avise 2004; Selkoe & Toonen 2006). Bottleneck analysis (Table S5, Supporting Information) did not reveal heterozygosity deficiency in any of the 17 populations.
Detection of loci under selection
Three of the nine loci were identified as outliers in 136 pairwise comparisons in FST analysis with LOSITAN at the 99% level (Fig. 3a). Two of the loci (RtCa11 and WRA1_160) were identified to be under stabilizing selection with low FST values, whereas the locus RC08604 was found to be under directional selection with a high FST value. We obtained the same results when the analysis was performed on data adjusted for possible null alleles (Fig. S1a, Supporting information). BAYESCAN identified only two markers possibly under selection: RC08604 (posterior probability = 1; log10 of Bayes Factor = 4.21) and WRA1_160 (pb = 0.9919; log10 BF = 2.09). Again, RC08604 showed higher FST values indicating directional selection, whereas WRA1_160 with low FST values was identified to be under stabilizing selection (Fig. S1b, Supporting information).
In the SAM method, we had a total of 95 alleles in the nine microsatellite loci tested. After calculating logistic regressions between all possible markerenvironmental pairs (a total of 190 models), and with a
(a)
significance threshold set to 95% (corresponding to P < 0.00026), SAM detected ten alleles at four loci associated with at least one environmental parameter. Two of these loci were also identified by LOSITAN (RC08604 and RtCa11; Fig. 3b). However, the locus WRA1_160 identified by LOSITAN and BAYESCAN was not detected by SAM. The ten alleles were associated with the habitat category environmental parameter, but only four of them were also associated with the environmental parameter CS1. With the significance threshold of 526.3E-09 (confidence level of 99.999%; Table S6, Supporting information), eight alleles in three loci remain associated with the habitat environmental parameter. Five of these alleles were in RC08604 and only one in RtCa11. The combination of these three different methods allows us to minimize the possibility that RC08604 is a false positive. That RC08604 was detected as an outlier locus using two different population genetic approaches and an environmental correlative approach strongly indicates that it is a good candidate locus for directional selection. We considered loci under stabilizing selection as the ones detected by at least two different approaches: WRA1_160 (LOSITAN and BAYESCAN) and RtCa11 (LOSITAN and SAM). It should be kept in mind that the outlier detection methods have several limitations. The most favourable situation for the detection of directional selection is that of low neutral FST (as in our case, with FST = 0.014). Under stabilizing selection, in contrast, a low neutral FST would reduce the efficiency of these methods (Pe ́rezFigueroa et al. 2010).

Population structure and correlation with habitat variation
Pairwise FST estimates based on the six neutral microsatellite loci and the three candidate loci under directional or stabilizing selection are shown in Tables S7 and S8 (Supporting information). The overall mean pairwise FST estimate for RC08604 (FST = 0.159; D = 0.319) was over tenfold higher than that estimated using the neutral markers (FST = 0.014; D = 0.020) or the loci under stabilizing selection (FST = 0.010; D = 0.014). After applying the Bonferroni adjustment for a significance level of 0.05 (P = 0.00036), none of the genetic distance estimates using the neutral markers was statistically significant (Table S7a, Supporting information), suggesting high levels of gene flow among breeding sites and weak population structure. However, the pairwise FST estimates with RC08604 were markedly higher showing significant differences between several breeding sites (Table S7b, Supporting information).
Mantel tests revealed no significant relationship between genotypic differentiation at neutral markers (FST or D parameters) and geographical distance; hence, there was no evidence of IBD among the demes (Table 3). Neither genotypic differentiation in RC08604 nor habitat variation (in accordance with Moran’s I correlogram results) were correlated with geographical distance. The relationship between genotypic differentiation at neutral markers and habitat variation was marginally significant (r = 0.14; P = 0.054) after controlling for geographical distances, suggesting a non-random pattern of gene flow between habitats. On the other hand, genetic differences in RC08604 under directional
selection correlated positively with habitat variation (r = 0.19; P = 0.044), and the positive relationship with habitat remained after controlling for geographical distances (Table 3). A Mantel test between the neutral FST and D showed a strong significant relationship between the differentiation parameters (r = 0.63; P = 0.001). However, the relationship between the genetic differentiation matrices estimated using the neutral loci and RC08604 was not significant (r = 0.16; P = 0.102).
Network properties
The network that fitted the neutral marker data best contained 32 edges connecting the 17 breeding sites, whereas the best network for RC08604 contained 37 edges, and the network constructed with the two candidate loci for stabilizing selection contained 43, indicating three different patterns of population connections (Figs 4 and S2, Supporting information). The higher number of connections resulting from the putatively stabilizing selection loci was expected because of the low genetic differentiation among localities measured when using these loci. The network obtained using RC08604 showed a higher number of connections than the neutral one, because genetic differences among sites with similar environmental conditions were lower, increasing the number of edges among sites considered as the same habitat (mean = 3 edges for RC08604, 1.87 for neutral markers). The Mantel test between cGD and geographical distance yielded a positive correlation using the neutral markers network (r = 0.14, P = 0.035), indicating IBGD. However, 31% of the edges were extended edges that connected populations that were

                       further apart than would be expected by the IBGD, whereas 53% were considered compressed edges connecting sites that were spatially closer than expected, given the genetics of the populations (Fig. 4). The presence of extended and compressed edges suggested that genetic distances are not proportional to the geographical distances, and that some other factors besides distance (e.g. strong local selection against migrants, habitat preference) might be shaping genetic covariance at this spatial scale. IBGD was not found for the networks with candidate loci, nor using RC08604 (r = )0.08, P = 0.742), nor for the candidate loci for stabilizing selection (r = )0.07, P = 0.178), indicating that in contrast to neutral markers, the spatial distribution of these loci were not defined by spatial distance.
When testing the possibility that population structure was constituted by distinct genetic groups according to the habitat type, the null hypothesis stated that the probability of obtaining an edge connecting both subgraphs in the graph was p = 0.514 (binomial test). Within the graph constructed with neutral markers or candidate loci for stabilizing selection, a non-significant deficiency of edges between ‘forest marshes’ and ‘open pond’ habitat sites was found (p(X £ Kbetween forest and open) = 0.146, and p(X £ Kbetween forest and open) = 0.764 respectively). However, the same analysis performed for RC08604 network detected a significant deficiency of edges (p(X £ Kbetween forest and open) = 0.033). This suggests that for the candidate locus under directional selection, local adaptation has acted as a source of spatial genetic structure between the two habitats resulting in two subgraphs within the network corresponding to the two
habitat types. However, this was not the case for the neutral markers. When the six neutral markers were run individually, the individual graphs differed in structure (number of edges) from the neutral set. But, in concordance with the six neutral marker set, no subgraphs related to the two habitat types were detected, only showing a subtle significance marker WRA1_22 [(p(X £ Kbetween forest and open) = 0.048); Table S9, Supporting information]. Note that two alleles from the WRA1_22 were detected as significantly associated with habitat by SAM (Fig. 3b), but the locus was not detected as an outlier using other approaches. A possible explanation for the marker–environment relationship could be that WRA1_22 is linked to a genomic region under selection, moderately increasing genetic divergence compared to neutrality. No correlations between genetic distance (FST) for WRA1_22 or any other neutral locus and habitat variation were detected (Table S10, Supporting information), confirming that the network of RC08604 and its genetic distance correlations are more determined by environmental differences than those of the putatively neutral markers.
Discussion
This study demonstrates the potential of combining information from neutral and candidate loci with environmental data to identify contrasting patterns of genetic variation related to different ecological environments. It has been argued that a comparison of spatial patterns of neutral markers and loci under selection would allow the disentanglement of the effects of gene

flow, genetic drift and selection (Ouborg et al. 2010). Although this is a promising approach, it has not been extensively used in the past (Luikart et al. 2008; Gebremedhin et al. 2009; Lowry 2010; Schwartz et al. 2010). In our study, spatial evidence for adaptation to the local environment was inferred by contrasting the correlations between environmental variables and a candidate locus under directional selection to those obtained with neutral markers.
We found contrasting results for six neutral loci, two candidate loci for stabilizing selection and one candidate locus for directional selection. Mantel tests and the graph approach demonstrated that while the environmental variation among the breeding sites influenced the genetic structure of locus RC08604, putatively a good candidate for directional selection, the pattern of population connectivity for the loci under stabilizing selection and neutral markers was qualitatively different, and their genetic distribution was not related to environmental variation (Fig. 1). The association between RC08604 and local environmental factors suggests habitat-mediated adaptation with a spatial signature of selection across localities (Novembre & Di Rienzo 2009). Higher FST values at RC08604 illustrate that selection may maintain higher levels of population differentiation at this locus than at the other loci, despite the absence of gene-flow barriers or isolation by distance in this system. The graph approach detected two sub-graphs within the network that were related with habitat traits in the candidate locus under directional selection but not in the neutral loci, suggesting genomic heterogeneity of gene exchange and divergent selection among the populations. As allele frequencies tend to approach equilibrium much faster in loci under selection than in neutral loci (Hemmer-Hansen et al. 2007), we conclude that the two different networks indicate that the higher differentiation at RC08604 between contrasting environments is maintained by contemporary selection, despite high gene flow among localities.
The existence of different graph patterns is in concordance with the idea of genetic mosaic at the early stages of ecological speciation with gene flow (Via 2009). At this stage, limited gene flow is only observable between different habitats at genomic regions under directional selection, as is the case with RC08604. Directional selection on fitness traits is strong enough to maintain divergence in this genomic region by reducing the effective recombination in a gene affecting local adaptation, but does not reduce recombination in other genomic regions. Stabilizing selection leads to constant allele frequencies over space, following a pattern similar to neutral markers (Mantel’s r = 0.29 between neutral markers and loci under stabilizing selection, P = 0.013, Table 3). Previous studies have found a relationship between functional
genetic variation ⁄ candidate loci and coarse landscape features (e.g. Bonin et al. 2006; Kane & Rieseberg 2007; Steiner et al. 2007; Storz & Kelly 2008), but there are very few examples of finer-scale studies (but see e.g. Nosil et al. 2009). The present results provide important insights not only for evolutionary studies, but also for conservation purposes by identifying conservation units (Palsbøll et al. 2007) and contemporary evolution processes (Stockwell et al. 2003) linked with adaptive potential and long-term persistence of populations.
Evidence for selection and selective agents
Several studies using common-garden experiments have demonstrated the adaptive value of local-scale genetic differentiation in amphibian larval life-history traits in response to pond permanency, water temperature and predation pressure (e.g. Skelly 2004; Van Buskirk & Arioli 2005; Orizaola & Laurila 2009; Richter-Boix et al. 2010). These studies have also shown that populations from wetlands with low temperatures and few predators tended to have higher growth rates and shorter larval periods than individuals from warmer wetlands with higher predator pressure. Such divergence among populations may exist even in the presence of certain levels of gene flow (Richter-Boix et al. 2010), confirming a strong directional selection between environments.
Local environmental variables measured in this study (water temperature, predation and desiccation risk) are known to be important selective factors for amphibian larvae (Wellborn et al. 1996; Werner & Glennemeier 1999; Van Buskirk & Arioli 2005) and proved useful in evaluating if the locus RC08604 is involved in local adaptation processes. RC08604 is partially located inside an up-regulated thyroid hormone receptor (TRb) gene cloned from R. catesbeiana (Vos et al. 2001). Thyroid hormone receptors (TR) coordinate the expression of other genes involved in the developmental changes during metamorphosis (Warkman & Chen 1998; Chen et al. 2007). The metamorphic process is controlled by thyroid hormone (T3), but the effects of T3 are mediated by TRs, which are high-affinity T3-binding nuclear proteins. TR gene expression is strongly correlated with tissue remodelling during metamorphosis. The induction kinetics of TRb to exogenous administration of T3 identifies it as a direct response gene (Helbing et al. 2003). The strong temporal correlation of TR mRNA levels with tissue-specific transformations supports the critical role of TRs during metamorphosis (Wong & Shi 1995), and TRs auto-regulate their own expression to facilitate the drastic metamorphic changes needed within a short developmental period (Shi et al. 1998). The allele differences within this marker and TRb gene polymorphisms found among R. arvalis populations can be responsible

for the phenotypic differences in larval period and growth rate detected among the populations. As in previous studies (Skelly 2004; Orizaola & Laurila 2009; Richter-Boix et al. 2010), we observed that individuals from forest canopy environments show higher developmental and growth rates than individuals from warmer open canopy environments, following a countergradient variation pattern (A. Richter-Boix et al. unpublished). The countergradient variation pattern allows the genetic effects on performance among localities to counter the environmental effects on performance. However, from a conservation perspective, the main goal is to find markers associated with environments or phenotypes and to compare their distribution patterns within and between populations against neutral markers (Ouborg et al. 2010); rather than exactly pinpointing the genes involved.
It is important to keep in mind that selection is not the only way by which the distribution of allelic variation can be changed at particular loci. Reduced variation or increased differentiation can result from genetic drift, bottlenecks and founder events; issues normally not considered when performing genomic scans (Excoffier et al. 2009; Hermisson 2009). Excoffier et al. (2009) demonstrated that failing to take into account past demographic events (e.g. bottlenecks) and the hierarchical structure of populations can result in a narrow null distribution of FST and an excess of false significant loci under selection. Our analyses indicated that none of the demes showed signs of a recent bottleneck, whereas FST and other differentiation measures indicated high gene flow among populations without a strong hierarchical structure within our study area, thereby reducing the possibility of finding false positives.
We detected null alleles in the candidate locus for directional selection in some of the demes. The association between the presence of null alleles and highly variable polymorphic flanking regions has been demonstrated repeatedly in molecular studies, suggesting that the sequences flanking microsatellites may be less stable than in other genomic regions (Callen et al. 1993; Angers & Bernatchez 1997; Grimaldi & Crouau-Roy 1997; Meglecz et al. 2004). The presence of null alleles can lead to an overestimation of FST. Null alleles appeared only in locus RC08604, while the other loci amplified normally, implying that the problem is not poor-quality DNA. The null alleles in the locus RC08604 seem to originate as mutations in the primerbinding or flanking regions that inhibit binding. We sequenced the TRb gene, including the region with the forward primer, for 376 individuals (A. Richter-Boix et al. unpublished), but did not find any mutation responsible for null allele suggesting that the mutation is in the backward primer of the microsatellite or in the
flanking regions. Null alleles only occur in some populations, and a heterozygote deficit may not be apparent across all populations. The non-random distribution of null alleles and other alleles across environments detected by SAM analyses suggests that localities with a homozygote excess are under strong directional selection, favouring specific alleles in each environments. In a previous study with the same species, seven of 12 populations showed HW disequilibrium, higher values of FST and null alleles in RC08604 (Vos et al. 2001), maybe as a consequence of a similar process. In our study area, null alleles are more frequent in forest marshes with cold water, while other alleles like RC08604 _172 or RC08604 _177 are more frequent in open canopy ponds with warm water and high predation risk. This allele–environment relationship is in concordance with the correlations found between TRb gene polymorphisms and phenotypic traits (A. Richter-Boix et al. unpublished).
Conservation and management implications
Managing microevolution effectively and facilitating adaptive responses to future changes is hindered by the current lack of knowledge of the scale of adaptation and the patterns of gene flow (Rice & Emery 2003). Understanding population structure and its relationship with environmental factors is thus critical for effective management and conservation of amphibians (Semlitsch 2008). Temporary ponds, the most common breeding habitats for amphibians, are heavily dependent on temperature and rainfall patterns and probably experience new selective pressures associated with global change (McMenamin et al. 2008; McCaffery & Maxell 2010). The interest for disentangling amphibian population structure has increased in recent years, and genetic studies have revealed that the pattern of population structure can vary substantially among species (Brede & Beebee 2003; Funk et al. 2005; Jehle et al. 2005; Zamudio & Wieczorek 2007; Chan & Zamudio 2009; Wang 2009), illustrating the necessity of regional studies before designing wetland-restoration plans. The optimal amount of gene flow in subdivided populations will depend on several factors, including the degree to which subpopulations are adapted to local conditions (McKay & Latta 2002). Efforts to restore or manage gene flow among populations can result in diminished adaptation and increase the risk of extinction in small and fragmented populations (Stockwell et al. 2003; see discussion about the complexity of managing amphibian populations showing local adaptations in Ficetola et al. 2007). However, gene flow has the potential to be much more powerful source of adaptive genetic variation than mutation (Gomulkiewicz et al. 1999) and could be

important in populations living in systems with fluctuating selection (e.g. precipitation, temperature and predation pressure are likely to fluctuate over time). Under these conditions, immigrants from a different environment can introduce genes that are closer to the new local optimum than those possessed by current residents (e.g., immigrants from open ponds to a recently deforested pond), providing an adaptive solution and potentially increasing population growth. Demographic stochasticity, drift, loss of genetic variation and inbreeding are the biggest problems in the conservation of small populations; however, these problems are often the final symptoms of populations’ earlier inability to keep eco-evolutionary pace with severe anthropogenic challenges (Kinnison & Hairston 2007). Preservation of genetic variation for an unknown future should be based on the preservation of natural environmental heterogeneity and natural connectivity among populations from different habitats, in order to maintain the natural population dynamics and eco-evolutionary processes of the system.
In conclusion, this study highlights the utility of analysing both putatively neutral and candidate loci for selection to understand the contemporary evolutionary history of populations. This, in turn, may prove useful in designating appropriate conservation units including important genomic variation that will be crucial for adaptation in future environments.
