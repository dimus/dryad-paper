Abstract
Habitat fragmentation can restrict geneflow, reduce neighbourhood effective population size, and increase genetic drift and inbreeding in small, isolated habitat remnants. The extent to which habitat fragmentation leads to population fragmentation, however, differs among landscapes and taxa. Commonly, researchers use information on the current status of a species to predict population effects of habitat fragmentation. Such methods, however, do not convey information on species-specific responses to fragmentation. Here, we compare levels of past population differentiation, estimated from microsatellite genotypes, with contemporary dispersal rates, estimated from multi-strata capture–recapture models, to infer changes in mobility over time in seven sympatric, forest-dependent bird species of a Kenyan cloud forest archipelago. Overall, populations of sedentary species were more strongly differentiated and clustered compared to those of vagile ones, while geographical patterning suggested an important role of landscape structure in shaping genetic variation. However, five of seven species with broadly similar levels of genetic differentiation nevertheless differed substantially in their current dispersal rates. We conclude that post-fragmentation levels of vagility, without reference to past population connectivity, may not be the best predictor of how forest fragmentation affects the life history of forest-dependent species. As effective conservation strategies often hinge on accurate prediction of shifts in ecological and genetic relationships among populations, conservation practices based solely upon current population abundances or movements may, in the long term, prove to be inadequate.

Introduction
Habitat loss and fragmentation are considered key drivers of biodiversity loss (Turner 1996), in particular in historically stable, species-rich ecosystems such as tropical rainforests (Laurance et al. 2002; Waltert et al. 2005;

Kirika et al. 2008). While habitat fragmentation may affect population dynamics in diverse and complex ways (Lewis 2006), long-term viability of species often hinges on their genetic population structure (Frankham et al. 2002). Habitat fragmentation can affect the genetic structure of populations both directly and indirectly, i.e. by restricting gene flow, reducing neighbourhood effective population sizes and⁄or increasing the levels of genetic drift and inbreeding in small, isolated habitat

remnants (reviewed in Frankham et al. 2002). The extent to which habitat fragmentation leads to population fragmentation, however, depends on properties of the landscapes in which suitable habitat patches are embedded and of the taxa that depend on these patches for their survival or reproduction (Caizergues et al. 2003). Along these lines, levels of genetic differentiation are generally lower in more connective landscapes, defined as the degree to which landscape elements facilitate movements between resource patches (Taylor et al. 1993), and in taxa that can cross hostile habitats more easily, such as birds (Crochet 2000; Ehrich et al. 2001; Ehrich & Stenseth 2001; Goossens et al. 2001). Because birds are considered a highly vagile group able to transverse wide spans of unsuitable habitat, their degree of within-species genetic structuring has been underappreciated in the past, especially so in montane species and tropical forest specialists (e.g. Brown et al. 2004; Moore et al. 2008 and references therein). However, a number of avian genetic studies did show high levels of population differentiation over small spatial scales, either as a result of severe philopatry, narrow habitat requirements or a ground-dwelling lifestyle with restricted flight ability (Avise 1996; Brown et al. 2004).
When key habitat of sedentary or specialist species becomes progressively fragmented, dispersal among remnant subpopulations may become disrupted and, in turn, affect population viability and rates of local adaptation (Hanski & Gilpin 1991). Dispersal and gene flow therefore comprise key processes underlying the regulation, persistence and adaptive evolution of spatially structured populations in heterogenous landscapes (Slatkin 1987; Hanski & Gilpin 1991; Frankham 1997; Hanski 1998; Whitlock & McCauley 1999). However, not all species appear to be equally sensitive to fragmentation (Van Houtan et al. 2006, 2007; Sekercioglu 2007), so it is of high importance to determine which species are more prone to extinction to improve future conservation actions. Commonly, researchers use information on the current status of a species (e.g. patch occupancy, current dispersal; Lens et al. 2002), but these methods do not imply any information on the speciesspecific response to fragmentation. For example, a species can have built up an ‘extinction debt’, which can result into a higher vulnerability for future extinctions (Tilman et al. 1994; Hanski & Ovaskainen 2002; Bulman et al. 2007), while other species might be more buffered from the loss of genetic diversity caused by fragmentation (Howeth et al. 2008). An alternative approach, therefore, is to infer species-specific responses to habitat fragmentation from genetic data which can provide information on historical processes prior to the date of sampling (Wilmer & Wilcox 2007; Lada et al. 2008; Howeth et al. 2008; Oddou-Muratorio & Klein 2008;
Pavlacky et al. 2009). Genetic differentiation among populations is traditionally measured by Wright’s (1931) FST or its derivates GST, G0ST, and Dest (Hedrick 2005b; Hedgecock et al. 2007; Jost 2008; Waples et al. 2008). These estimates are considered to reflect historical rates of geneflow integrated over multiple generations (Allendorf & Luikart 2007), although geneflow estimates can be biased in case of mutation-drift (Hedrick 2005b) or migration-drift (Whitlock & McCauley 1999; Lowe & Allendorf 2010) disequilibrium. Genetic estimates that (indirectly) reflect past population connectivity may be particularly informative when combined with direct estimates of contemporary dispersal rates among a restricted number of focal populations (Koenig et al. 1996; Whitlock & McCauley 1999; Faubet et al. 2007), thereby allowing an evaluation of changes in mobility over time (Howeth et al. 2008; Lowe & Allendorf 2010).
Here, we report on a study of the genetic signature of population fragmentation in seven sympatric, forestdependent bird species of a Kenyan cloud forest archipelago that were earlier shown to differ in their response to forest fragmentation, as inferred from postfragmentation levels of mobility and patch occupancy (Lens et al. 2002). A diverse set of genetic parameters ⁄ tests were used to infer signals of bottlenecks (deviation from mutation ⁄ drift equilibrium) and changes in gene flow over time (migration ⁄ drift equilibrium). We compare species-specific levels of genetic population differentiation using Dest (Jost 2008), representing historic dispersal rates averaged over time (Bohonak 1999; Allendorf & Luikart 2007; Palsboll et al. 2007), and compare these with contemporary dispersal rates based on multi-strata mark-recapture analysis (data from Lens et al. 2002). Ultimately we assess whether the magnitude of genetic effects is correlated with loss of mobility.
Materials and methods
Study area and species
The Taita Hills (SE Kenya, 03°20¢S, 38°15¢E) represent the northernmost part of the Eastern Arc Mountains biodiversity hotspot of Kenya and Tanzania (Lovett & Wasser 1993). They cover an area of c. 250 km2 and are isolated from other highlands by over 80 km of semiarid plains in either direction (Lovett 1985). During the last 200 years, indigenous forest cover in the Taita Hills decreased by c. 98%, and forest remnants are mainly located at hilltops and ridges and isolated by small holder cultivation plots and exotic plantation forests (Lens et al. 1999; Adriaensen et al. 2006; Pellikka et al. 2009). Three larger forest fragments (86–220 ha) and

eight small ones (2–8 ha) are located on two mountain isolates (Dabida: 9 fragments; Mbololo: 2 fragments) separated by a low-altitude valley (Fig. 1; Brooks et al. 1998; Pellikka et al. 2009). Smaller fragments are most heavily disturbed, mainly as a result of logging, pole cutting and cattle grazing (Chege & Bytebier 2005). Among the three largest fragments, Chawia forest (CH, 86 ha; Dabida isolate) is most heavily degraded, Ngangao forest (NG, 120 ha; Dabida isolate) is intermediately degraded, and Mbololo forest (MB; 220 ha; Mbololo isolate) is most pristine (Brooks et al. 1998; Lens et al. 1999). The three largest fragments are inhabited by all
seven study species, whereas the cluster of smaller fragments hosts subsets of these species only (based on breeding evidence during 1996–2001 in Lens et al. 2002), and analyses in this study are restricted to breeding populations in fragments CH, NG and MB.
Between 1996 and 2009, a total of 5002 individuals of seven forest-dependent species were trapped (no use of tape luring or artificial feeders), marked, measured and blood-sampled in fragments CH, NG and MB: Stripecheeked greenbul (Andropadus milanjensis striifacies; 626 ind), Cabanis’s greenbul (Phyllastrephus cabanisi placidus; 679 ind), Taita thrush (Turdus helleri; 491 ind),

P. ruficapilla, T. helleri, A. milanjensis, P. cabanisi and N. olivacea are presumed forest specialists, while Z. silvanus and P. stellata are presumed forest generalists (Bennun et al. 1996).
DNA extraction and genotyping
Upon capture of an individual, we collected 2–3 lL of blood from its brachial vein and stored it in 95% ethanol or DMSO. DNA was isolated either by boiling in a 5% Chelex solution (Biorad) after an incubation period of 90 min at 55 °C in the presence of 100 lg proteinase K (ethanol storage) (Walsh et al. 1991) or by a normal phenol–chloroform extraction in the presence of 100 lg proteinase K (DMSO storage) (details in Galbusera et al. 2000). PCR amplification was executed in a 10-lL reaction volume containing approximately 100 ng DNA, 1· buffer (75 mM Tris–HCl pH 9.0, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20), 0.5 U Taq polymerase (Eurogentec), 200 lM dNTPs (GIBCO), 1.0–3.0 mM MgCl2 (product size ranges and optimal reaction conditions in Appendix 1) and 250–500 nM of each primer from 4 to 10 variable microsatellite markers. Starting from the original PCR conditions, variable MgCl2, template DNA concentrations and annealing temperatures were tested in a gradient PCR device (PC-960G Gradient Thermal Cycler; Labotechnic). Genotypes were scored on a 6% acrylamide gel in an automatic sequencer (ALF express; Pharmacia Biotech) or on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and microsatellite lengths were determined with GeneMapper Software v4.1. Microsatellite data for all species have been deposited in the Dryad data repository (doi: 10.5061/dryad.8054).
Genetic analysis
Presence of null alleles was tested with program MICROCHECKER 2.2.3 by running 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations and calculating 95% confidence intervals (Van Oosterhout et al. 2006). Deviation from Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium per locus were tested with program GENEPOP 4.0 (Raymond & Rousset 1995; Rousset 2008). Apart from the following marker*population combinations, all loci were consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (all P > 0.05 after Bonferonni correction, Rice 1989): P. stellata: WBSW9 (P = 0.0016) and Pat14 in population CH (P = 0.0019); GF5B in population MB and NG (P < 0.002). Apart from WBSW9 and GF5B in P. stellata, none of the loci showed null alleles (removing both loci
did not change our results; see also Galbusera et al. 2004). No linkage disequilibrium was detected between any pair of loci after correction for multiple testing (Rice 1989).
Observed and expected levels of heterozygosity were calculated with GENALEX 6.4 (Peakall & Smouse 2006), while allelic richness corrected for sample size was calculated with FSTAT 2.9.3.2 (Goudet 1995). To infer levels of population genetic differentiation, we calculated overall and pairwise Dest values across all loci with SMOGD 1.2.5 (Crawford 2009). This estimate is increasingly considered more accurate than traditional ones such as FST (Wright 1951, 1965) and GST (Nei 1973; Nei & Chesser 1983) in accounting for differences in allelic diversity, especially for highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and in cases where assumptions for traditional calculations (e.g. migration ⁄ drift equilibrium) are violated (Jost 2008). For the sake of comparison, we also presented FST values (Wright 1951, 1965) calculated with GENEPOP 4.0 using parameter h (Weir & Cockerham 1984; Raymond & Rousset 1995; Rousset 2008). To test whether relationships between genetic population differentiation and contemporary dispersal rates differed between fragments located on the same mountain isolate (NG–CH) or two different isolates separated by a dry valley (MB–NG, MB–CH), we performed an analysis of covariance in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, 2002–2008).
The genetic population structure of each species was inferred from a Bayesian admixture model implemented in TESS 2.3. This procedure earlier proved to be more powerful than nonspatial algorithms, especially in weakly differentiated populations (Chen et al. 2007; Durand et al. 2009). To properly assess the genetic population structure of each species, we explored a wide range of values for the number of genetic clusters, K (varying from 1 to 9), and assessed the fit of the model to the data for each value (Francois & Durand 2010). A total of 100 independent iterations (each 50 000 sweeps long and discarding the first 30 000 sweeps) were run for each value of K. Model fits were compared with the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC, Spiegelhalter et al. 2002), a penalized measure of fit accounting for model complexity (models with lower DIC values fit data better). DIC values averaged over 100 independent iterations were plotted against K, and K-values for which DIC values first reached a plateau were selected (procedure similar to ‘logarithm of evidence’ in STRUCTURE; Evanno et al. 2005). The 10 runs with lowest DIC values for the selected K-value were retained and their admixture estimates were averaged using CLUMPP version 1.1.1 (Jakobsson & Rosenberg 2007), applying the greedy algorithm with random input order and 1000 permutations to align the runs and calculate G¢ statistics. Results were visualized using DISTRUCT 1.1 (Rosenberg 2004).

Deviation from mutation ⁄ drift equilibrium was tested by comparing levels of heterozygosity calculated from observed allele frequencies (sensu Nei et al. 1975; Nei 1987) with those expected under equilibrium with program Bottleneck 1.2.02 (Piry et al. 1999). As the mutation model underlying our microsatellite markers was unknown, data were analysed under two different model assumptions: two-phase model (TPM) and stepwise mutation model (SMM; Luikart & Cornuet 1998; Di Rienzo et al. 1994; Jarne & Lagoda 1996; Piry et al. 1999). When modelling TPM models, combinations of 95% single-step mutations and 5% multistep mutations were used, with a variance of 30 among multiple-step mutations (104 replications; Piry et al. 1999).
Deviation from migration ⁄ drift equilibrium was tested by comparing the relative likelihoods of ‘geneflow ⁄ drift’ and ‘drift only’ models with the program 2MOD, using a MCMC procedure with 105 iterations and a burn-in of 104 (Ciofi et al. 1999). Time intervals between population founding and population sampling were assumed sufficiently short such that effects of mutations were negligible (drift only), while mutation rates were assumed much smaller than migration rates (geneflow⁄drift). Data were analysed under both models, and Bayes factors were calculated to infer decisive power estimates of the most likely models (Jeffreys 1961; Goodman 1999).
Contemporary dispersal rates
Contemporary dispersal rates were available for each of the seven study species from Lens et al. (2002), based on capture–recapture histories of 3089 individuals trapped and individually marked in the large fragments CH, NG and MB between 1996 and 2002. Individual recapture histories were generated using time intervals of 1 month. A total of 889 individuals were captured– recaptured in two or more months, and among these, 47 individuals were captured–recaptured in two or more fragments. Monthly probabilities of betweenfragment dispersal were estimated from multistrata mark-recapture recapture models in program MARK (White & Burnham 1999). Based on Akaike’s Information Criteria (AIC), the most parsimonious model was selected from a candidate set in which monthly probabilities of survival, recapture and dispersal were modelled simultaneously. Because distances differed between pairs of fragments (MB–NG, 11.3 km; MB–CH, 19.4 km; NG–CH, 10.9 km) and estimates of dispersal might be biased by differences in abundance between fragments for the different species, multistrata models were constructed that estimated monthly dispersal probabilities between each pair of fragments irrespec-
tive of the direction of dispersal. In a final step, we regressed pairwise dispersal probabilities against pairwise distances between the three forest fragments for each species, then used the intercept of each regression equation as the species-specific measure of contemporary dispersal (see Lens et al. 2002 for details on candidate models). Contemporary dispersal rates were positively correlated with contemporary geneflow rates estimated with BAYESASS 1.3 (Wilson & Rannala 2003) (F1,5 = 9.93, P = 0.025). Species-specific estimates were based on 3 000 000 iterations, a burn-in of 999 999, a sampling frequency of 2000, and a delta–value of 0.15. Because of the large confidence intervals (probably resulting from the low number of individuals and markers compared to those recommended by Wilson & Rannala 2003) and the fact that geneflow estimates are difficult to interpret when levels of genetic differentiation are low (Faubet et al. 2007), contemporary mobility was inferred from rates of dispersal, rather than geneflow, that were based on larger data sets, multiple recapture events and multiple years.
Results
Genetic population structure
Genetic differentiation was highly variable among the seven study species, as shown by strong differences in both pairwise (between populations CH, NG and MB) and overall estimates of Dest (Table 1, see FST values for comparison). Dest estimates were very low (close to 0) in N. olivacea, markedly high (0.2–0.4) in T. helleri, and intermediate in the remaining species. Figure 2 depicts the level of genetic clustering for each study species with barplots per individual visualizing the inferred admixture proportions within each fragment. Individuals of T. helleri, P. ruficapilla and P. cabanisi were assigned to three genetic clusters corresponding to the three forest fragments (see Appendix 2 for details on model choice). Cluster differentiation was strong for T. helleri and P. ruficapilla but lower for P. cabanisi (Fig. 2). Individuals of A. milanjenis, P. stellata and Z. silvanus were assigned to two genetic clusters, in each case with one cluster consisting of populations CH and NG, and the other consisting of population MB, with the highest differentiation in A. milanjensis and the lowest differentiation in P. stellata (Fig. 2). Individuals of N. olivacea were assigned to a single panmictic cluster. Overall, strong genetic clustering corresponded with strong genetic differentiation (high Dest) and vice versa (Fig. 2, Table 1). In all species except for P. cabanisi, pairwise genetic differentiation between populations CH–NG, located on the same isolate, was consistently lower than between populations CH–MB and NG–MB,

models (Table 4). In all other species, ‘migration ⁄ drift’ models were more likely than pure drift models, whereby evidence for migration⁄drift equilibrium ranged from decisive to substantial in T. helleri, P. stellata, A. milanjensis, N. olivacea, but was weak in Z. silvanus and P. cabanisi.
Change in mobility over time
Figure 3 relates species-specific levels of genetic population differentiation and patch occupancy to contemporary dispersal rates. N. olivacea showed the lowest level of genetic differentiation, the highest levels of patch occupancy and contemporary dispersal, and a single genetic cluster. T. helleri, in contrast, showed very strong genetic differentiation, very low levels of patch occupancy and contemporary dispersal, and three genetic clusters. The other five species were distinguished by broadly similar levels of genetic differentiation and two or three genetic clusters, but varied strongly in contemporary dispersal (ranging from zero in P. ruficapilla to relatively high in Z. silvanus) and patch occupancy (3–8 forest fragments occupied). Relationships between genetic differentiation and contemporary dispersal did not differ when fragments were located on the same or different mountain isolates (F1,11.2 = 1.04, P = 0.3286).
Discussion
Loss of gene flow because of reduced dispersal, and reduction in effective population size because of genetic drift, can re-distribute genetic variability among spatially structured populations over the course of a few generations only (Harrison & Hastings 1996). Within the isolated Taita Hills of South-East Kenya, severe fragmentation of the original indigenous forest cover resulted in varying levels of population subdivision among seven sympatric, ecologically related forest bird species. There was strong consensus among species in the geographical patterning of genetic variation, reflecting the important role of landscape structure in genetic clustering and population differentiation (Storfer et al. 2007). For instance, in all three species that comprise two genetic clusters, cluster MB was consistently separated from cluster NG–CH and between-cluster genetic differentiation was always higher than within-cluster differentiation. The strong isolation of populations in fragment MB from those in fragments CH and NG is likely due to the presence of a low-altitude valley that reduced gene-flow levels even prior to human-induced deforestation (Brooks et al. 1998; Pellikka et al. 2009).

Levels of allelic richness and observed and expected heterozygosity did not significantly differ among populations (Nonparametric Friedman test: all Fr between 1.556 and 4.571, all P > 0.05; see values in Table 2). Values of allelic richness and HO in populations MB and NG of P. ruficapilla were low compared to all other species. However, because of large variability in number and type of microsatellite markers among species, this difference could not be tested statistically. Levels of heterozygosity significantly exceeded those expected under mutation-drift equilibrium (Table 3) in population CH of species T. helleri (Wilcoxon test; TPM: P = 0.008; SMM: P = 0.016), populations MB and NG of P. ruficapilla (MB: TPM and SMM: P = 0.02; NG: TPM and SMM: P = 0.008) and population NG of Z. silvanus (TPM: P = 0.03; not significant after clustering with population CH; Appendix 3). None of the other populations or clusters showed evidence of heterozygosity excess. In P. ruficapilla, ‘drift only’ models were 16.8 times more likely than ‘migration ⁄ drift equilibrium’

While two species clearly stood out as having either low or high mobility according to both historic and current estimates (T. helleri and N. olivacea, respectively), five other species showed highly variable current dispersal rates despite broadly similar levels of genetic population differentiation.
The most contrasting species pair in terms of current and historic mobility was P. ruficapilla and T. helleri, both highly sedentary species with (near) zero current dispersal but relatively low and very high levels of genetic differentiation, respectively. While genetic differentiation, reflecting geneflow over many generations, cannot be compared in absolute terms with dispersal

While both species showed evidence of a genetic bottleneck in one or more populations, P. ruficapilla was the only species that also showed evidence of migration ⁄ drift disequilibrium, hence confirming our interpretation of a recent decrease in gene flow among its remnant populations. Lack of evidence for a similar decrease in gene flow in T. helleri suggests that the extremely low mobility of this critically endangered species is not of recent origin. Earlier, radio-telemetric data showed that individuals forage and move strictly within indigenous forest boundaries, with no evidence of excursions into the landscape matrix (Lehouck et al. 2009). Such a strong dependence of T. helleri on prime indigenous forest matches with its exceptionally high level of stress sensitivity inferred from spatio-temporal patterns in tarsus asymmetry, a presumed proxy of environmental stress (Lens et al. 1999). Stress-sensitive forest specialists such as T. helleri can be expected to have become locked in very early in the fragmentation process, which is thought to have

the fragmentation process. However, progressing deterioration of these small stepping-stone patches (an estimated 50% of indigenous forest cover was lost to agriculture and admixture with secondary growth and exotic plantations between 1955 and 2004; Pellikka et al. 2009) may have resulted in a strong and recent reduction in mobility, explaining the migration ⁄ drift disequilibrium of P. ruficapilla with evidence for a recent bottleneck in fragment MB, the largest, most pristine, but also most isolated fragment of the Taita archipelago.
Two other species with intermediate levels of genetic differentiation, P. stellata and P. cabanisi, showed low to moderate dispersal rates, suggesting (moderate) losses in mobility over time, however without evidence for migration ⁄ drift disequilibrium. While individuals of P. cabanisi were assigned to three genetic clusters, P. stellata showed only two clusters. Such a difference in genetic clustering among two species with comparable contemporary dispersal rates may result from variation in sensitivity to habitat disturbance. Unlike all other study species, P. cabanisi forages and breeds in small family groups (T. Callens, unpublished data). Group living species are thought to exceed the carrying capacity of small and disturbed habitat remnants more easily and pay higher costs of biotic interactions near habitat edges and in the landscape matrix than pair living species (Van Houtan et al. 2006). This may explain
why P. cabanisi is currently absent from nearly half of the Taita forest remnants (Lens et al. 2002). In contrast, P. stellata breeds in most of the small forest patches, including highly degraded forest remnants as small as 0.2 ha (Spanhove et al. 2009). Given such tolerance to degraded habitat, P. stellata dispersers from large, intact forest fragments may regularly settle in small, degraded remnants scattered across the landscape, resulting in step-wise gene flow between the larger fragments. Alternatively, discrepancies between historic and current estimates of mobility might result from a downward bias in dispersal estimates, e.g. because fledglings are only captured post-dispersal (see Van Treuren et al. 1999). In P. cabanisi, 127 nestlings (ringed 2007–2009) yielded 26 retraps, none of which originated from another fragment, while in P. stellata, 282 nestlings (ringed 2002–2005) yielded 50 retraps, 5 of which originated from another fragment (T. Callens & T. Spanhove, unpublished data). While these limited data sets prevent us from formally testing variation in timing of natal dispersal between both species, they do suggest that the accuracy of dispersal rates estimated from postfledgling mark-recapture data may differ among species (see Desante 1995; Thomson et al. 1999). Yet, given that dispersal estimates used to infer current mobility rates in this study were statistically corrected for betweenspecies heterogeneity in survival and recapture rates and did not comprise recapture events of ringed nestlings (Lens et al. 2002), they are still considered valid for comparison of relative mobility rates.
Results from this study hence confirm the conclusion from other multi-species studies that sympatric forest birds may differ strongly in genetic signature of forest fragmentation (Bates 2002; Brown et al. 2004; Burney & Brumfield 2009). More importantly, our study shows that such differences may also appear among species with broadly similar levels of current mobility. In line with this, Van Houtan et al. (2006, 2007) hypothesized that post-fragmentation levels of vagility may not be the best predictor of how forest fragmentation affects the life history of forest-dependent species. Rather, species which range more widely pre-fragmentation, e.g. those that track unpredictable food resources or frequently join (mixed-species) flocks, may be more vulnerable to post-fragmentation extinction compared to species that do not cross gaps as often. Earlier, we proposed that conservation tactics in the fragmented Taita ecosystem may fail unless they include action both within sites, to minimize habitat deterioration, and across sites within the landscape, to maximize dispersal (Lens et al. 2002). As part of a series of conservation initiatives funded by Conservation International, over 150000 indigenous tree seedlings have been raised in community-owned tree nurseries since 2006.

To address within-site issues, initial efforts are being undertaken to restore disturbed sections within the indigenous forest fragments. For between-site action, priority areas for reforestation within the matrix were selected based on a combination of least-cost modelling analysis (where we quantified landscape connectivity and identified likely dispersal corridors linking the indigenous fragments; Adriaensen et al. 2006), forest ecology (silvicultural) characteristics and sociological aspects (Githiru & Lens 2007). Findings from the current study provide evidence that habitat isolation results in reduced genetic connectivity, but most importantly show that not all species are equally sensitive. Combining landscape, demographic and behavioural data with population genetic data, such as presented here, therefore helps to determine which species may be most prone to extinction, and hence, to rationalize conservation action at species level (Pavlacky et al. 2009; Lowe & Allendorf 2010). For instance, while conservation action for P. ruficapilla should primarily focus on the restoration of landscape connectivity through creation of small (stepping-stone) forest patches, such action may not suffice for T. helleri unless combined with habitat-restoration programmes in all occupied forest fragments. For P. stellata and P. cabanisi, the apparent loss in current versus historic mobility and different patterns of genetic clustering merely act as an early warning system against future losses in gene flow and genetic variation.
