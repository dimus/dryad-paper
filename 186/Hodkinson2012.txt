Abstract The lichenized basidiomycete Lepidostroma vilgalysii 
from Mexico is described based on morphological analyses. 
The species is only the second representative of the 
family Lepidostromataceae documented from the New 
World, and is one of the few described lichens with an inverted 
morphology, with the algae in a layer at the base of the thallus. 
Molecular sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal LSU 
locus are used to confirm the placement of the holotype in 
Lepidostroma and to evaluate the molecular distinctiveness of 
the species from all other described species in the family and 
genus.

Introduction 
While the vast majority of lichenized fungi belong to the 
phylum Ascomycota, there are several small clades with 
lichenized members that belong to Basidiomycota 
(Oberwinkler 1970). The thalli formed by these types of 
fungi are often collectively referred to as ‘basidiolichens’. 
In contrast to the much more common ‘ascolichens’, the 
basidiolichens generally have fruiting bodies that are 
ephemeral like other mushrooms and club fungi, making 
the collection of fertile material a somewhat rare occurrence 
(Honegger 1996). As a result, basidiolichen species are 
often overlooked or may be impossible to identify due to a 
lack of sexual characters. 
The basidiolichen genus Lepidostroma was established by 
Mägdefrau &Winkler (1967) to accommodate the NewWorld 
species Lepidostroma terricolens. Subsequently, the type species 
has been reduced to synonymy with L. calocerum (G.W. 
Martin) Oberw. (Oberwinkler 1984). More recently, two additional 
species from Africa were described (Fischer et al. 2007) 
and transferred to the genus based on molecular data (Ertz et al. 
2008). These new data also demonstrated that the unique genus 
warranted the creation of a new family, Lepidostromataceae, 
which cannot currently be placed definitively in any known 
fungal order (Ertz et al. 2008). 
Within the established framework of these three wellcharacterized 
Lepidostroma species, we examine the phylogenetic 
and taxonomic position of a clavarioid fungus recently 
collected by Dr. Rytas Vilgalys from the Trans- 
Mexican Volcanic Belt that was sequenced and found to 
have molecular affinities to the genus Lepidostroma. We 
present the subsequent morphological and molecular analyses 
that revealed it to be a representative of a previously 
undescribed species.

were studied dry using a Bausch & Lomb StereoZoom 7 
dissecting microscope and wet using an Olympus BX51 
compound microscope. Images were captured using an 
Olympus DP20 digital camera with the MicroSuite Special 
Edition 5.0 software package (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and 
illustrations were prepared using Photoshop CS3 (Adobe, 
San Jose, California). The specimen RV-MX16 was divided, 
with one portion being deposited at The New York 
Botanical Garden Herbarium (NY) and the other being 
deposited in the Duke University Herbarium (DUKE). 
Molecular protocols Dried sporocarp tissue of RV-MX16 
was homogenized with a sterile micropestle and DNA was 
extracted with the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, 
CA USA). The nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU or 
28S) was PCR-amplified with the primer combination 
LROR/LR5F using published protocols (Vilgalys and 
Hester 1990, Tedersoo et al. 2008). PCR products were 
viewed on 1.5% agarose gels stained with SYBR Green I 
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Amplicons were 
cleaned with EXO (Exonuclease I) and SAP (shrimp alkaline 
phosphatase) enzymes (Glenn and Schable 2005) and 
sequenced with the Big Dye 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, California) using the same primers used for 
amplification. Sequencing reactions were cleaned and then 
processed on an ABI 3730xl genetic analyzer (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, California) at the Duke University 
Genome Sequencing & Analysis Core Facility. Newly generated 
sequence reads were edited using Sequencher 4.9 (Gene 
Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). The final corrected sequence 
was subjected to a BLASTn search as outlined by Hodkinson 
et al. (2010), using NCBI’s non-redundant nucleotide collection 
from May 2011 (Altschul et al. 1997), and subsequently 
deposited in GenBank under accession number JN698908. 
Phylogenetic analyses The full LSU data set assembled by 
Ertz et al. (2008) was used as a reference for phylogenetic 
inference. Sequences from Ertz et al. (2008) were downloaded 
from GenBank in FASTA format and edited using a 
customized Perl script, ‘sequence_renamer.pl’, available in 
the data package associated with this manuscript, deposited 
in the Dryad data repository (http://datadryad.org/; data 
package URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.j1g5dh23; 
data package DOI: 10.5061/dryad.j1g5dh23; Hodkinson et 
al. 2011). All sequences were aligned using default settings 
in MAFFT 6.853 (Katoh et al. 2002; http://mafft.cbrc.jp/ 
alignment/server/) and adjusted by hand with Mesquite 2.74 
(Maddison & Maddison 2010). Phylogenetic analyses were 
performed on the portion of the LSU region that overlapped 
in all of the Lepidostroma sequences, both those generated 
for this study and those stored in GenBank. Ambiguouslyaligned 
regions were excluded, and RAxML-HPC-SSE3 
7.2.8a (Stamatakis, 2006) was run using a backbone 
constraint tree. The constraint tree consisted of the terminals 
in the tree presented by Ertz et al. (2008) (with the exception 
of Athelia arachnoidea MYA-3672, which lacked LSU sequence 
data) and contained only nodes supported by maximum 
likelihood (ML) bootstrap proportions (BP) =70% in 
Ertz et al. (2008). One thousand topology searches and an 
equal number of bootstrap pseudo-replicates were performed 
under the GTRGAMMA model, and RAxML-HPC 
7.0.4 was used to map BP values to the best topology. The 
tree was visualized with FigTree 1.2.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac. 
uk/software/figtree/), and Illustrator CS4 (Adobe, San Jose, 
California) was used to make the final phylogeny figure. 
The analyzed alignment file was formatted for and deposited 
in TreeBASE (http://www.treebase.org/; study accession 
URL: http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2: 
S12029; submission 12029) and analysis files were made 
available through the Dryad data repository (http://datadryad. 
org/; data package URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad. 
j1g5dh23; data package DOI: 10.5061/dryad.j1g5dh23; 
Hodkinson et al. 2011). 
Pair-wise sequence analyses A pair-wise distance matrix of 
Lepidostroma LSU sequences was created to examine variation 
between both members of the same species and members 
of different species. The portion of the LSU gene that 
was sequenced for all samples was isolated for analysis from 
the full nucleotide alignment using Mesquite 2.74 
(Maddison & Maddison 2010). Sites with polymorphisms 
due to a single sequence differing from all others were 
treated as suspicious, since sequencing errors can easily 
produce such polymorphisms; therefore, sites that were 
unambiguously-aligned and had only one sequence that 
differed from the others were excluded from pair-wise distance 
calculations. Unambiguously-aligned sites with ambiguous 
base calls were additionally excluded. Pair-wise 
distances between unaligned sequences were calculated by 
executing the ‘pairwise.seqs’ function with default settings 
in Mothur 1.19.2 (Schloss et al. 2009). 
Results 
Morphological analyses revealed yellow to orange-brown 
basidiocarps with distinctively cream-colored tips; these tips 
are especially apparent when dry (Fig. 1a-c). The squamules 
have a white, raised margin (Fig. 1a-b) that becomes less 
distinct as squamules mature or become wet (Fig. 1d). The 
squamules’ upper surfaces are maculate (Fig. 1d) due to 
columns of photobiont cells projecting upward from the 
main algal layer at the base (Fig. 1e). Elongate-ovoid spores 
on bi-sterigmate basidia were observed (Fig. 1f) on the 
fruiting bodies, and the upper cortex of the squamules was 
828 Mycol Progress (2012) 11:827–833

seen to be comprised of polygonal (in both side view and 
from above) cells that were sometimes in a single layer and 
sometimes in multiple layers (Fig. 1g-h). The overall squamule 
morphology and other features not mentioned here 
(but described below in the taxonomic section) are similar 
to those described for the species L. rugaramae. 
The phylogenetic inference places the new species within 
a clade comprised of all defined species in the genus 
Lepidostroma (Fig. 2). Finer-scale relationships between 
the species within the genus could not be resolved with 
confidence using the present molecular data set. A pairwise 
analysis of all LSU sequences generated for members 
of the genus shows that distances between sequences within 
species range from 0 to 0.013, while the distances between 
sequences representing different species fall within the 
range of 0.019 to 0.096 (Table 1).

morphology of L. rugaramae). With regard to the basidiocarps, 
those of the new species do not show the reddish tinge 
found in those of L. rugaramae. Furthermore, L. rugaramae is 
known only from central Africa, whereas L. vilgalysii has only 
been found in Central America. The only other species in the 
genus known fromthe NewWorld is L. calocerum. The thallus 
of L. calocerum differs from that of the new species by having 
reniformto deeply lobate, rarely rounded, squamuleswithout a 
swollen, whitish margin or maculae. The only other species 
described in the genus is L. akagerae; while L. akagerae 
has discrete, turgescent, and slightly convex squamules that 
are contiguous or irregularly lobulate (Botrydina-type), all 
other members of the genus possess Coriscium-type thalli 
comprised of dispersed squamules that are typically either 
rounded (as in L. rugaramae and L. vilgalysii) or reniform 
to deeply lobate (as in L. calocerum) (Fischer et al. 2007). 
Additional features that distinguish L. vilgalysii from other 
members of the genus include the distinct, broad pale 
cream-colored apex that is most evident when dry; the 
basidiocarps are also often darker along the top half (with 
the exception of the cream-colored tip) and lighter as they 
taper toward the base. Other noticeably different features 
include the more elongate shape of the spores and the bisterigmate 
basidia. In addition to morphological evidence, 
the degree of molecular divergence seen in the LSU region 
between L. vilgalysii and all others in the genus indicates 
that this species is distinct from those previously described 
in the group (Table 1). 
Distribution and habitat The species was first collected in 
2007, on a clay embankment in Pinus-dominated forest at 
3,015 meters above sea level near San José Teacalco in 
estado Tlaxcala, Mexico. Additional specimens representing 
the species could not be located.

Discussion 
Both the placement of the new specimen within Lepidostroma 
and the distinction of it from members of all described species 
in the genus can be established based on morphological and 
molecular grounds. An analytical approach integrating these 
two types of data revealed a clear taxonomic solution for the 
material under investigation. We therefore describe the new 
species Lepidostroma vilgalysii to accommodate this specimen 
and encourage collectors to seek out additional material 
so that this entity can be evaluated for the purpose of 
conservation. 
Morphological study of the type indicates that the thallus 
most closely resembles the central African species 
Lepidostroma rugaramae, as both species have whiterimmed 
squamules with conspicuous maculae (Fig. 1d) 
resulting from pyramidal photobiont columns (Fig. 1e). 
However, the basidiocarps are yellow to orange-brown, 
without the reddish tinge seen in L. rugaramae, and the 
apex is distinctively cream-colored, especially when dry 
(Fig. 1a-c). Additionally, the spores are more elongate, 
making them larger overall (Fig. 1f), and the cells of the 
upper cortex of the thallus are polygonal in surface view 
and often multi-layered (neither jigsaw-like in surface view 
nor consistently in a single layer as in L. rugaramae; 
Fig. 1g-h). 
The new species is only the second New World species in 
the genus, along with Lepidostroma calocerum. The thallus 
of L. calocerum differs from that of the new species by 
having squamules that are reniform to deeply lobate, rarely 
Mycol Progress (2012) 11:827–833 831

rounded, without any paler spots or maculae, and without a 
swollen, whitish margin. The full geographic range of L. 
vilgalysii is likely to overlap with L. calocerum, given that 
both species are known from the same portion of the Trans- 
Mexican Volcanic Belt. 
The only other described species in the genus, 
Lepidostroma akagerae, has squamules which are discrete, 
turgescent, slightly convex, and contiguous or irregularly 
lobulate. These features of the squamules distinguish it from 
all other members of the family, including L. vilgalysii. The 
thallus of L. akagerae is known as ‘Botrydina-type’, while 
all other members of the genus possess ‘Coriscium-type’ 
thalli, which are comprised of dispersed squamules that are 
typically either reniform to deeply lobate (as in L. calocerum) 
or rounded (as in L. rugaramae and L. vilgalysii) (Fischer et 
al. 2007). 
The molecular phylogeny shows the Lepidostroma vilgalysii 
specimen nested within the genus Lepidostroma, most 
closely related to L. calocerum and L. rugaramae (Fig. 2). 
Placement in a clade with these two species is congruent 
with morphological analyses; however, robust resolution of 
relationships between these three species will require additional 
sequence data. Based on pair-wise analyses of LSU 
sequences, the genetic distances between the L. vilgalysii 
sequence and sequences from other Lepidostroma species 
suggest that it is not conspecific with any of the described 
members of the genus (Table 1). 
The species described here is interesting because it represents 
one of the rare cases of an inverted thallus morphology 
(with the algae growing primarily in a layer along the 
base of the thallus), a feature that can also be found in 
Lepidostroma calocerum and L. rugaramae. Lichens with 
these types of thalli are often referred to as ‘window lichens’ 
and occur rarely in disparate lineages (e.g., Buellia, 
Lepidostroma, Peltula), apparently as an adaptation to dry 
conditions (although this explanation may not be appropriate 
for L. calocerum) (Büdel & Schultz 2003; Ertz et al. 2008; 
Vogel 1955).
