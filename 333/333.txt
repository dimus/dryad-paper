Abstract - Corallorhiza striata is a wide-ranging, morphologically variable, mycoheterotrophic species complex distributed across North 
America. Objectives of this study were to assess relationships and test validity of previously delimited varieties of C. striata, including the 
recently described C. bentleyi. Two plastid DNA regions were sequenced for individuals from several populations across North America, 
identifying four major clades. The large-flowered C. striata var. striata (northern U.S.A., southern Canada) was sister to the smaller-flowered 
var. vreelandii (southwestern U.S.A., Mexico), and these were sister to a Californian clade with relatively intermediate-sized flowers. C. striata 
var. involuta (Mexico) and the endangered C. bentleyi (eastern U.S.A.) shared a close relationship, sister to the remaining C. striata. Principal 
Components Analysis and Nonparametric Multivariate Analysis of Variance on nine quantitative morphological characters, using plastid 
DNA clades as independent variables, demonstrated strong correlations between molecular and morphological groupings. Morphological 
analyses supported differentiation of both C. striata var. involuta and C. bentleyi relative to all other accessions of C. striata, suggesting their 
recognition as separate species; these findings will have future implications for conservation. The biogeographic scenario was more complex 
than previously thought, with members of two major plastid DNA lineages (C. bentleyi /var. involuta and the remaining C. striata) existing in 
Mexico and U.S.A. /Canada. These findings contribute to a burgeoning body of data on poorly studied North American plant distributions 
extending into southern Mexico.

Numerous studies have been published in recent years 
documenting patterns of plant DNA sequence variation in 
Europe (e.g. Démesure et al. 1996; Taberlet et al. 1998; Hewitt 
2000), the Holarctic region (e.g. Abbott and Brochmann 2003; 
Abbott and Comes 2004; Alsos et al. 2005; Eidesen et al. 
2007), and North America (e.g. Soltis et al. 1997; Avise 2000; 
Soltis et al. 2006; Cornman and Arnold 2007; Marr et al. 2008). 
However, relatively few studies have focused on plants shar- 
ing Mexican-northern North American distributions (Miranda 
and Sharp 1950; Hoey and Parks 1994; Graham 1999; Rowden 
et al. 2004 Morris et al. 2008). One species complex that exem- 
plifies this geographic distribution is Corallorhiza striata 
Lindley, a morphologically diverse group of rootless, leafless, 
fully mycoheterotrophic orchids with an extensive distribu- 
tion across the North American continent. Populations of 
C. striata are uncommon to rare in low- to mid-elevation coni- 
fer forests in the western portions of Canada and the north- 
ern U.S.A. From there they occur in mixed forests eastward 
throughout the northern Great Lakes region, becoming rarer 
in eastern Canada to Newfoundland, where there are two 
known populations. They also occur southward in the Sierra 
Nevada and southern Rocky Mountains and into high eleva- 
tion oak-conifer forests in the sierras of Mexico to the state of 
Oaxaca (Freudenstein 1997). 
Extensive morphological variation is observed within 
C. striata across its geographic range, with large-flowered pop- 
ulations throughout Canada and the northern U.S.A. (flowers 
20-45 mm in diameter), medium-size-flowered populations 
in the southwestern U.S.A. into Mexico (flowers 12-30 mm 
in diameter), and small-flowered populations in the moun- 
tains of Mexico (flowers 10-25 mm in diameter; Freudenstein 
1992, 1997). This variation has prompted some researchers to 
recognize separate species within the complex (summarized 
in Freudenstein 1997). An ordination analysis of five morpho- 
logical characters in C. striata based on dried herbarium speci- 
mens (Freudenstein 1992) showed that variation was largely 
due to flower size differences, and several of the characters 
used in the aforementioned analysis showed allometric pat- 
terns in size variation. A conclusion of this study was that 
C. striata follows a nearly clinal pattern of decreasing flower 
size from northern North America southward through the 
U.S.A. into Mexico, and thus only varieties were recognized 
(Freudenstein 1997). 
The closely allied C. bentleyi Freudenstein is a recently dis- 
covered, endangered species (critically imperiled [rank SI 
Gl]; www.dcr.virginia.gov, www.wvdnr.gov) consisting of 
ca. 15 known populations restricted to a small region in the 
Appalachian Mountains of Virginia and West Virginia, U.S.A. 
(Freudenstein 1999). This newly described species shares 
morphological features with the three varieties of C. striata, 
including a thick labellum, an involute (incurved or boat 
shaped) labellum margin, faintly striped perianth parts, and 
absence of a mentum (a small spur at the base of the label- 
lum present in all other Corallorhiza species [Freudenstein 
1992]). In particular, it shows similarities to C. striata var. invo- 
luta, including reduced, half-open flowers at anthesis, and 
an apparent reproductive mode of self-pollination. This is 
evidenced by the tendency for all flowers in a raceme to set 
seed (sensu Catling 1990), which contrasts with the larger and 
more open-flowered varieties vreelandii and striata (pers. obs.) 
in which far fewer flowers per raceme set seed. Flowering 
times also overlap between C. bentleyi and var. involuta in (late 
July /early August) as opposed to April-June for vars. vreelan- 
dii and striata. 
The C. striata complex is monophyletic, and sister to the 
remaining species of Corallorhiza (Freudenstein 1992; Barrett 
and Freudenstein 2008; Freudenstein and Senyo 2008). 
However, relationships among the three morphologically 
determined C. striata varieties and the related C. bentleyi 
are poorly understood. A phylogenetic analysis of the sub- 
tribe Corallorhizinae based on ITS and plastid matK regions 
(Freudenstein and Senyo 2008) included some representatives 
of C. striata (four accessions) and C. bentleyi (one accession). 
This analysis identified two clades within C. striata: one con- 
sisting of var. involuta and C. bentleyi, and another consisting 
of vars. striata, vreelandii, and an additional accession of var.

involuta. Barrett and Freudenstein (2008) presented a phylog- 
eny of the genus Corallorhiza that included a denser sampling 
of the C. striata complex (20 accessions) based on nuclear ITS 
and plastid rbcL. Their results confirmed the findings of the and plastid rbcL. Their results confirmed the findings of the 
former analysis, and further showed extensive geographi- former analysis, and further showed extensive geographi- 
cally structured nucleotide sequence variation within the 
C. striata complex. Interestingly, accessions of the small-flow- 
ered variety involuta appeared to occupy two divergent clades 
in both analyses (Barrett and Freudenstein 2008; Freudenstein 
and Senyo 2008). These findings demonstrate the need for 
a reassessment of infraspecific delimitation in the complex 
that should incorporate both morphology and high-variation 
molecular markers. The rarity of these orchids across their 
geographic range (especially in the case of the endangered 
C. bentleyi) further underscores the importance of gaining 
more detailed knowledge on species and infraspecific bound- 
aries within the complex; this information will have implica- 
tions for their conservation. 
The main objective of this study was to infer the evolution- 
ary relationships among the previously delimited infraspecific 
varieties of C. striata and the closely related C. bentleyi. Another 
objective was to gain further understanding about the nature of 
morphological variation among members of the C. striata com- 
plex from different geographic areas. We hypothesized a bio- 
geographic scenario in which C. striata has origins in Mexico, 
based on an analysis naming Mexico the most parsimonious 
area of origin for Corallorhiza (Freudenstein 1994). More spe- 
cifically, we expected to observe "basal'' plastid DNA (ptDNA) 
types occurring in Mexico with sequentially more derived 
types existing in populations further north into North America, 
a pattern observed in congener C. maculata (Freudenstein and 
Doyle 1994). We also expected this pattern of ptDNA varia- 
tion to correlate with shifts of increasing flower size among 
populations along this geographic trajectory. We employed 
two variable plastid DNA regions, morphometric analysis of 
field-collected material, and sampling of populations across 
North America to test whether the three varieties and C. bent- 
leyi (sensu Freudenstein 1997; 1999) form distinct clades, and 
whether geographic patterns in ptDNA variation correlate 
with patterns of geographic variation in morphology. 
Materials and Methods 
Sampling of Plant Material - Orchids were collected across North 
America to maximize geographic, habitat, and morphological diversity 
(42 populations). For the majority of populations, one to four individu- 
als were used for DNA and morphological analyses (Appendix 1). Single 
flowers of the endangered C. bentleyi were collected for morphological 
and DNA analyses, the goal being not to remove whole plants. Material 
for DNA isolation was either shipped fresh from the field and frozen at 
-80°C, or silica dried. Liquid-preserved flowers were fixed in formalin- 
acetic acid-alcohol (FA A) then transferred to 70% ethanol. At least one 
plant per population was specified as a voucher specimen and deposited 
at the Ohio State University Herbarium (OS). 
DNA Extraction, Amplification, and Sequencing - Total DNAs were 
isolated from either fresh or frozen (-80°C) floral tissue using a modified 
CTAB protocol (Doyle and Doyle 1987). PCR amplification and sequenc- 
ing were completed according to the protocol of Barrett and Freudenstein 
(2008) for rbcL, and Shaw et al. (2007) for rpl32-trnL. An internal 
sequencing primer was designed for the rpl32-trnL spacer, rpl32^164R 
(TATTTTGAAAAGCACAATTC), to improve data quality immediately 
downstream from a problematic 5' poly-thymine repeat region. GenBank 
accession numbers for rbcL and rpl32-trnL are given in Appendix 1, and 
data matrices are available at TreeBASE (study number S2221). 
Alignment and Phylogenetic Analyses - Multiple alignments were 
conducted for each locus in ClustalX (Thompson et al. 1997) using six 
separate gap insertion: extension ratios (10:0.1, 10:1, 10:5, 30:0.1, 30:1, 
and 30:5). Results were nearly identical in each case, and minor adjust- 
ments to the final alignment were made manually. Maximum parsimony 
(MP) and maximum likelihood (ML; Felsenstein 1973) searches were ducted to estimate phylogenetic relationships within the C. striata plex. Outgroups included Aplectrum hyemale (Muhlenburg ex Willdenow) 
Nuttall, Cremastra appendiculata (D. Don) Makino, and Oreorchis ens (Lindi.) Lindi., based on previous findings of close relationships Corallorhiza, and the position of C. striata as sister to the remaining of the genus. Analyses were performed using rbcL and rpl32-trnL vidually and then in a combined analysis including insertion/ deletion 
characters using simple gap coding following guidelines of Simmons 
and Ochoterena (2000). MP analyses were run in PAUP* v4blO (Swofford 
2002). Heuristic searches were implemented with 1,000 random addition 
sequence replicates (RAS) saving multiple trees per replicate, and bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. Maximum parsimony 
branch support was assessed via the parsimony jackknife (JK; Farris al. 1996), using the same parameters described above for each of 5,000 replicates, and the "emulate JAC" feature. 
Maximum likelihood searches were run in PAUP* v4bl0 starting a neighbor-joining (NJ; Saitou and Nei 1987) tree using 10 RAS and Each individual data matrix plus the combined data matrix was analyzed 
using Modeltest (Posada and Crandall 1998) to select best-fit evolution- 
ary models under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; Akaike This method was chosen over standard hierarchical likelihood ratio test- 
ing (Felsenstein 1988) due to several advantages discussed in Posada and 
Buckley (2004). 
Morphological Analyses - Nine morphological characters were mea- 
sured, including column length, labellum length, labellum width, callus 
length (callus refers to the 2-lobed ridge at the base of the labellum), cal- 
lus width, lateral sepal length, lateral sepal width, dorsal sepal length, 
and dorsal sepal width. All width measurements were made at the widest 
points of the respective perianth parts. An ocular micrometer was used for 
all measurements, calibrated to a fastened ruler prior to analyzing each 
individual. A total of 82 individuals were measured, including: 36 indi- 
viduals of var. striata, 28 individuals of var. vreelandii, eight individuals 
from California that were not assigned to a particular variety, and five 
individuals each of var. involuta and Corallorhiza bentleyi. Measurements 
were repeated for some randomly selected individuals, as a means to 
ensure precision. Data were analyzed using both standard and multi- 
variate methods; the latter reduce Type-I errors often associated with the 
implementation of several pairwise statistical comparisons. All morpho- 
logical analyses were completed using the PAST software package, v. 1.76 
(Hammer et al. 2001). Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro- Wilk 
test (Shapiro and Wilk 1965), histograms, and Mardia's Multivariate Test 
(Mardia 1970). Pairwise correlations between characters were tested using 
Spearman's Rank Correlation (p), which rests on no assumptions about 
frequency distributions of the variables (Zar 1999). 
Both raw and Iog10-transformed data were analyzed using principal 
components analysis (PCA), and eigenvalues were extracted from the vari- 
ance-covariance matrix. Linear relationships between variables (an assump- 
tion of PCA) were checked by pairwise linear regression. A scree plot was 
used to compare calculated eigenvalues with those generated from a ran- 
dom model (i.e. broken stick; Legendre and Legendre 1998). Spearman's p 
was used to test for significant correlations between each character and the 
first two PCs. Individuals were specified based on major clades identified 
from the ptDNA phylogeny. Nonparametric multivariate analysis of vari- 
ance (NPMANOVA; Anderson 2001) was used to test the null hypothesis 
of equal means among members of clades identified from the molecular 
analysis, using Euclidean distances. This method was chosen over the 
more commonly used discriminant function analysis because it was not the 
objective of the present study to classify unknown individuals into a priori 
taxonomic groupings. Instead, clades identified by phylogenetic analysis 
were tested as potential descriptors of the observed variation in morphol- 
ogy. Nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance (implemented in 
PAST v. 1.76 [Hammer et al. 2001]) was based on 100,000 permutations of 
group membership. In this analysis, "clade" was designated as the cate- 
gorical independent variable, and morphological character values were the 
continuous dependent variables. Although MANOVA and NPMANOVA 
are not commonly employed in morphological studies, NPMANOVA was 
chosen because it best fits our hypothesis testing framework.

Considering the combined dataset of rbcL and rpl32-trnL, 23 
distinct ptDNA types were identified (including individu- 
als of C. bentleyi). The data matrix contained 1,563 and 828 
aligned characters for rbcL and the rpl32-trnL spacer, respec- 
tively. A total of 15 informative insertion /deletion characters 
were coded (simple gap coding; Simmons and Ochoterena 
2000): five occurred in the rbcL alignment and ten in the rpl32- 
trnL spacer. Individually, rbcL and rpl32-trnL gave single most 
parsimonious trees 127 and 101 steps in length, respectively 
(Supplemental Online Figure SI). Apart from differences 
in resolution, there was no conflict between the topologies, 
so the data matrices were combined and analyzed together 
along with 15 indel characters, yielding a more resolved 
topology (Fig. 2). These two markers showed adequate capa- 
bility to resolve both "deep" clades within the species com- 
plex, and to detect multiple ptDNA types within populations 
(five polymorphic populations). The Akaike Information 
Criterion as implemented in Modeltest (Posada and Crandall, 
1998) selected GTR + I for rbcL, TrN + r + I for rpl32-trnL, 
and GTR + I for the combined dataset. Maximum Likelihood 
topologies for each individual dataset under their respective 
evolutionary models (Fig. SI) were identical to each other 
and congruent with the single most parsimonious trees for 
both individual analyses and the combined parsimony analy- 
sis (Fig. SI, combined ML analysis: -lnLGTR + I = 4656.56). Since 
topologies were identical for both MP and ML, only the MP 
tree will be discussed. 
Two differentiated clades emerged from the combined MP 
analysis (Fig. 2). The first consisted of three accessions of 
C. bentleyi + five accessions of C. striata var. involuta ( JK = 100). 
In fact, this clade shared 61 total synapomorphies including 
one rbcL deletion and four deletions in the rpl32-trnL spacer. 
Interestingly, the three C. bentleyi accessions were fully identi- 
cal to four accessions of var. involuta from the Mexican states 
of Mexico and Morelos, all of which are sister to a single, simi- 
lar accession of var. involuta (JVF 2155) from Oaxaca. 
Sister to this were all of the remaining C. striata accessions 
(Fig. 2). Geographic structure was observed within this clade: 
five individuals from four populations sampled in the western 
Sierra Nevada in California (Fig. 2, clade B) were sister to the 
remaining members of C. striata ( JK = 100). Furthermore, each 
California individual represented a unique plastid sequence 
type, suggesting a substantial level of nucleotide polymor- 
phism within /between these populations. The remaining 
C. striata individuals comprised two sister clades (JK = 100); 
these together shared eight nucleotide changes. The first of 
these (JK = 90) consisted of 22 individuals from populations 
sampled in the southwestern U.S.A. (Arizona, Colorado, 
New Mexico, and Utah), two individuals from a single pop- 
ulation in Hidalgo, Mexico, and three individuals from two 
populations in western Newfoundland. Seven ptDNA types 
comprised this clade, with the Newfoundland individuals 
being identical to two individuals from a single population in 
Arizona (ptDNA type Cl). Lastly, a "northern" clade (Fig. 2, 
clade D; JK = 84) consisting of nine ptDNA types was identi- 
fied, all of which were collected from populations north of 42° 
N latitude. Four populations in relatively close proximity in 
northern Utah (Fig. 1) yielded no evidence for admixture of 
ptDNA types from clades C and D (Fig. 2). Multiple ptDNA 
types of clade C were found in two out of three of these popu- 
lations (JVF 2773 and CFB 116), while multiple types of clade 
D were observed in population CFB 120, including type D6 
which was sampled only there.

lateral sepal width (W = 0.975; p = 0.1) suggested deviations 
from normality. For the remaining characters with nonnor- 
mal distributions, Iog10-transformation did confer normal- 
ity in most cases. Visual inspection of histograms for each 
character did not identify outliers as the probable causes for 
these deviations; instead, the data appeared to follow a mul- 
timodal distribution in correspondence with clades of ori- 
gin (Fig. S2). Spearman's p indicated significant correlations 
among all pairwise comparisons of morphological charac- 
ters suggesting that overall variation for C. striata is due to 
size. Nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance, using 
the four ptDNA clades as categorical independent variables 
based on 100,000 permutations, identified significant differ- 
ences for both raw data (F = 139.5; p < 0.0001) and Iog10-trans- 
formed data (F = 78.12; p < 0.0001). When clade A was divided

Posthoc pairwise NPMANOVAs between sible combinations of the five groupings resulted cant differences in all cases (p < 0.0075 for each Thus, ptDNA clades identified from the phylogeny were sufficient descriptors of patterns of morphological ferentiation in the characters measured. 
Pairwise regressions of characters indicated strong linear 
relationships for all comparisons (data not shown). Principal relationships for all comparisons (data not shown). Principal 
components (PCs) 1 and 2 explained 84.0 and 6.7% of the total components (PCs) 1 and 2 explained 84.0 and 6.7% of the total 
variance for Iog10-transformed data (Table 1, Fig. 3); thus, the 
great majority of the variance was explained by PCI, largely 
reflecting correlated size variation (Sneath and Sokal 1973). 
Comparison of eigenvalues for each PC with a random model 
of eigenvalues (broken stick) showed a sharp drop in the 
amount of variation explained after PCI (data not shown). 
Therefore, only the first two PCs are discussed. No single 
character dominated PCI, and all characters had positive 
coefficients and significant Spearman's correlations with this 
PC axis (Table 1). Labellum length, dorsal sepal length, lateral 
sepal length, labellum width, and column length contributed 
most strongly to PC 1, in decreasing order. PC2 was mainly 
determined by callus length, lateral sepal width, and dorsal 
sepal width; all three were significantly correlated with PC2 
(Table 1), but the latter two characters had negative loadings, 
representing an important positive-negative contrast between 
these characters and callus length. 
Corallorhiza bentleyi was placed in a distinct position at the 
upper left of Fig. 3. The five individuals of this species were 
separated from five individuals of C. striata var. involuta. Since 
members of these two taxa were differentiated by PC2, varia- 
tion between them was mostly caused by differences in callus 
length (Table 1; Mann- Whitney U test of callus lengths, p = 
0.012). For PC2, the positive-negative contrast between callus 
length and both lateral and dorsal sepal widths suggests that

variation in shape distinguishes C. bentleyi, C. striata var. invo- 
luta, and the remainder of C. striata. 
Variety vreelandii (ptDNA clade C) showed considerable 
morphological variation across its range. Individuals from 
two Newfoundland populations (Rocky Brook [RB] and 
Lomond River [LR]) fell within a group of var. vreelandii 
individuals from the U.S. Southwest and Mexico. The three 
Hidalgo specimens that were initially assigned to var. involuta 
(Freudenstein 1992) were shown here to cluster more closely 
with var. vreelandii both genetically (Fig. 2) and morphologi- 
cally (Fig. 3). Accessions of clade C (var. vreelandii) did not, 
however, overlap with those of the larger flowered clade D 
(var. striata) from the northern U.S.A. and Canada (Fig. 3). 
These two varieties were differentiated strictly along PCI, 
emphasizing correlated size differences among characters. 
Mann-Whitney U-Tests were significant for comparisons of 
all characters between members of these two clades, further 
illustrating the lack of overlap between them (p < 0.01 for all 
character comparisons). Intermediate to these two varieties 
were eight accessions from the Sierra Nevada of California. 
These were not assigned a priori to either vars. vreelandii or 
striata, due to the fact that they superficially appeared to 
exhibit size characteristics intermediate to both. PCA did not 
fully distinguish the Californian accessions from var. striata 
(Fig. 3), as there was a small degree of overlap between the 
two groups. 
Discussion 
Does Morphological Variation Correlate with ptDNA 
Variation? - Plastid DNA sequence data from rbcL and the 
rpl32-trnL spacer identified four major clades in the C. striata 
complex. Principal components analysis identified distinct 
groups corresponding to these clades, except in the case clade B (Californian accessions) in which some individuals 
overlapped with members of clade D. The ptDNA clades ade- 
quately explained morphological groupings, as shown by sig- 
nificant NPMANOVA. This represents a different pattern association than was previously hypothesized (Freudenstein 
1992) in terms of the relationship between morphology, mole- 
cules, and geography. The original expectation was that mor- 
phological variation would correlate with a series of nested 
hierarchical clades, by following a trend of either increasing 
or decreasing flower size among individuals occupying con- 
secutively more derived positions in the ptDNA tree. The 
hypothesized biogeographic scenario would have been, a simplistic sense, a pattern easily described by the migra- 
tion and gradual change among populations of C. striata range expansion progressed from some ancestral source in 
Mexico. However, a more complicated evolutionary scenario 
has emerged from the current analysis. Morphological vari- 
ation follows a clinal pattern of increasing flower size from 
south to north when considering the C. striata complex a whole. However, when morphological variation is parti- 
tioned by ptDNA clades, the pattern is equally well explained 
by each plastid lineage bearing a distinct morphological iden- 
tity (except for clade B from California). 
Taxonomic Implications - Lack of overlap in morphology 
and the finding of reciprocal monophyly in ptDNA relation- 
ships between vars. vreelandii (clade C) and striata (clade reinforce their recognition at the varietal level (Freudenstein 
1997). Sampling of populations at the geographical interface these two varieties yielded no populations containing ptDNAp. 500

types from both clades C and D. In fact, sampling efforts were 
specifically targeted toward populations along the contact 
zone between vars. vreelandii and striata (between 3SMt3°N lat- 
itude, Fig. 1), especially in northern Colorado, northern Utah, 
southern Wyoming, and southern Oregon. This finding does 
not completely eliminate the possibility of populations exist- 
ing that contain members of both varieties, where hybridiza- 
tion /introgression could potentially occur, but does suggest 
the possibility of past allopatric differentiation and secondary 
contact. These two varieties may in fact be separate, recently 
diverged species, but further investigation is advisable before 
ranking them at the specific level (multiple unlinked nuclear ranking them at the specific level (multiple unlinked nuclear 
DNA markers, cross pollination studies, etc.). DNA markers, cross pollination studies, etc.). 
It is unclear how members of clade B (accessions from 
the northern Sierra Nevada of California) fit into the pres- 
ent infraspecific classification of the C. striata complex. 
Morphology alone suggests an intermediate position of these 
individuals between vars. vreelandii and striata (Coleman 
1995). This pattern might be attributed to hybridization/ 
hybrid introgression. However, the position of these ptDNA 
types as a distinct clade sister to the two aforementioned vari- 
eties emphasizes their evolutionary distinctness within the 
complex. California collections have often been classified 
as var. vreelandii and sometimes var. striata based on mor- 
phology (Hickman 1993; Coleman 1995; Freudenstein 1997). 
Given our findings, simply assigning these individuals to one 
of two currently described infraspecific taxa based on mor- 
phology alone cannot be justified. Within California, C. stri- 
ata occurs along a thin stratum of midelevation forest of the 
western Sierra Nevada south to King's Canyon, across the 
northern portion of the state to the Coast Ranges, and south 
to the Santa Cruz Mountains (Coleman 1995). Further sam- 
pling of California populations in terms of molecular (includ- 
ing nuclear loci), morphological, and phenological variation 
will be necessary to better characterize the taxonomic status 
of these accessions. 
As evidenced from phylogenetic analysis and PC A, the geo- 
graphically widespread clade C (var. vreelandii; southwest- 
ern U.S.A. and Mexico (Fig. 1) exhibits a substantial degree 
of morphological variation (Fig. 3). Accessions collected in 
Hidalgo, Mexico, were originally assigned by Freudenstein 
(1992) to var. involuta, due to relatively miniscule flower size 
characters. Morphological, ptDNA, and phenological similar- 
ity (plants were post-anthesis on collection date of 27 July) all 
suggest that these individuals group closely with members of 
clade C and should be regarded as var. vreelandii. This popula- 
tion represents the only Mexican collections of var. vreelandii 
in this study. Phenological data from herbarium vouchers of 
Mexican specimens suggest that this earlier-flowering variety 
(corresponding to clade C) is restricted to high elevation, mesic 
forests of the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Transvolcanic Belt 
(Freudenstein 1997), as opposed to the later-flowering, more 
widespread var. involuta. 
The three individuals from western Newfoundland were 
found to have identical sequences (ptDNA type Cl) to var. 
vreelandii individuals from populations in southeastern 
Arizona, U.S.A. However, the Newfoundland individuals had 
a somewhat distinctive morphology relative to other acces- 
sions in clade C, including those identical for ptDNA from 
Arizona (Fig. 3). The Newfoundland individuals characteris- 
tically had stouter perianth parts, with lower length-to-width 
(1/w) ratios for labellum (mean 1/w = 1.19), lateral sepals 
(mean 1/w = 1.80), and dorsal sepals (mean 1/w = 2.20); var. 
vreelandii excluding the Newfoundland collections had mean 
1/w of 1.69, 2.47, and 3.00 for the three ratios, respectively. It is 
possible that these represent an ecotype associated with high 
latitude environments, since the northernmost populations 
of var. vreelandii in the continental U.S.A. are found in Utah, 
more than 900 km south of Newfoundland. 
A major finding of this study was that C. striata var. invo- 
luta from southern Mexico and the recently described C. bent- 
leyi from the Appalachian Mountains are similar, and in most 
cases identical, for neutral ptDNA markers (Fig. 2). In addi- 
tion to their divergent relationship with the remaining mem- 
bers of C. striata, populations of C. bentleyi and var. involuta 
are both believed to be largely autogamous. When first dis- 
covered in the 1990s, individuals from the initial population 
of C. bentleyi (Freudenstein 1999; S. Bentley pers. comm.) were 
thought to be completely cleistogamous; populations discov- 
ered subsequently have placed this in doubt, but the degree 
of perianth opening during anthesis is limited in this species, 
as with the closely related C. striata var. involuta. Thus, self- 
ing may be a synapomorphy for these two taxa (supporting 
clade A). Lastly, the two taxa overlap in phenology, flowering 
in late July to early August. Climatic conditions differ during 
this time between the two regions. It is typically the warmest 
part of the year in the eastern U.S.A., while it is cooler and 
(seasonally) wetter in the mountains of southern Mexico, sug- 
gesting that phenological overlap between the two taxa is not 
simply coincidental. 
In contrast, our morphological findings suggest that 
C. bentleyi and C. striata var. involuta dire distinct based on PCA 
(Table 1; Fig. 3) and NPMANOVA. They are distinguished in 
PCA (Fig. 3) by PC2, which emphasizes differences in callus 
length, and to a lesser extent lateral and dorsal sepal widths 
(Table 1). In addition to their morphological distinctness, 
these two taxa are separated by thousands of kilometers and 
are reproductively isolated by virtue of geographic distance. 
The present study supports the distinction of C. bentleyi and 
C. striata var. involuta as species segregated from the remain- 
der of C. striata (var. involuta was previously recognized as 
C. involuta Greenman; Freudenstein 1997). We consider this 
morphological distinctness to be the most important crite- 
rion for future ranking decisions; the existence of two distinct 
ptDNA clades, A and (B(C,D)), provides further evidence for 
the separation of C. striata relative to C. bentleyi + C. striata 
var. involuta. Explicit taxonomic treatment will be completed 
when greater sample sizes and nuclear DNA data are attained 
for C. bentleyi and C. striata var. involuta. Although it was 
expected that C. bentleyi would be distinct from var. involuta 
for ptDNA markers, it surprisingly was not. Given the overall 
ptDNA variation in the complex, this finding most likely rep- 
resents a relatively recent, vicariant sundering of populations 
of these two taxa. The fact that C. bentleyi and four accessions 
of C. striata var. involuta are identical for rbcL and rpl32-trnL 
(Fig. 2) cannot be interpreted as positive evidence for their 
recognition as a single species; additional genetic markers 
could illustrate otherwise. 
Biogeographic Patterns - Morphological and ptDNA vari- 
ation throughout the geographic range of C. striata illustrate 
a more complex biogeographical scenario than was previ- 
ously hypothesized. It is not apparent where the divergence 
of C. striata from the ancestor to the remainder of Corallorhiza 
occurred. Freudenstein (1994) suggested Mexico as the ances- 
tral area, and probable area of origin for Corallorhiza. Based on 
the present analysis, the simple case that the group originatedp. 501

in Mexico and expanded into the U.S.A. and clinally increasing flower size (Freudenstein assumed. 
Some similarities exist between continental-scale distri- 
butional patterns of ptDNA variation for C. striata and con- 
gener C. maculata (Raf.) Raf. Both species groups are present 
throughout North America including Mexico, and both have 
significant "Pacific" components: C. mertensiana Bongard 
(Pacific Northwest of U.S.A. and Canada) in the C. macu- 
lata complex, and clade B of the present analysis for C. stri- 
ata (sampled only in the Sierra Nevada of California). The 
restriction site analysis of Freudenstein and Doyle (1994) on 
C. maculata identified the most "basal" chlorotypes (i.e. the 
first to diverge from the remaining accessions) to be restricted first to diverge from the remaining accessions) to be restricted 
to Mexico, including the rarer Mexican endemic C. bulbosa A. to Mexico, including the rarer Mexican endemic C. bulbosa A. 
Richard and Galeoti. Corallorhiza maculata vars. maculata and 
occidentalis along with C. mertensiana occupied more derived 
positions, and are found throughout northern North America, 
with C. mertensiana restricted to the Pacific Northwest. 
However, the biogeographical patterns in C. striata may 
not be as straightforward as those for C. maculata. This is spe- 
cifically due to the presence of C. bentleyi in eastern North 
America, as well as the presence of var. vreelandii in Mexico. 
Variety vreelandii has a much more restricted geographic 
range within Mexico than var. involuta, occurring at disjunct 
locations in the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Transvolcanic 
Belt (Freudenstein, 1997). This, along with its derived position 
with respect to more northern members of clade C (i.e. from 
Arizona), suggest that var. vreelandii may have more recently 
colonized these areas of Mexico. 
Since C. striata is the sister group to the remaining 
Corallorhiza species (Freudenstein 1994; Freudenstein and 
Senyo 2008; Barrett and Freudenstein 2008), the C. striata 
complex potentially could be quite old, allowing for multi- 
ple range expansions, contractions, and dispersals. One plau- 
sible scenario could be the presence of the ancestor of clade 
A (C. bentleyi + var. involuta) and clade (B(C,D)) throughout 
Mexico, and North America, with subsequent climate-driven 
range contraction leading to allopatric differentiation between 
clades A and the ancestor of (B(C,D)). Thus, C. bentleyi and 
C striata var. involuta may be relicts left from a once broader 
distribution of the ancestor of this clade. Continuous and dis- 
junct distributions between Mexico and the eastern U.S.A. 
are not uncommon. For example, Liquidambar styraciflua L., 
Nyssa sylvatica Marsh., and Mitchella repens L. share disjunct, 
vicariant Mexican-eastern North American distributions, iso- 
lated by the xeric regions of northeastern Mexico and Texas 
("Liquidambar-type" disjunction; Miranda and Sharp 1950). 
Further, palynological records show that during recent gla- 
cial maxima, forests of Abies and Picea (suitable C. striata habi- 
tat) existed in the now xeric regions between the present-day 
mesic, higher elevation forests of Mexico and the Appalachian 
Mountains (Potzger and Tharp 1947; Pielou 1991). Liquidambar 
styraciflua is a particularly well-studied example in which 
DNA based analyses have been undertaken. This species has 
more differentiated populations in Mexico than in northern 
North America (Hoey and Parks 1994; but see ptDNA anal- 
ysis of Morris at al. 2008); however, this pattern is more in 
accordance with that observed in C. maculata (Freudenstein 
and Doyle 1994) than in C. striata. 
Since clades B, C, and D all are present in the western por- 
tion of North America, it is likely that this region played a 
critical role in the divergence of the group. Clade (B(C,D)) cor- 
responds with a different distributional pattern than C. striata 
var. involuta and C. bentleyi, better represented as a "Madrean- 
Rocky Mountain" distribution (Dressier 1954; Takhtajan 
1986). Most of the northern U.S.A. and Canada were subject 
to multiple cycles of expansion and contraction of ice sheets 
and mountain glaciers during the Pleistocene (Pielou 1991), 
and certainly these processes influenced the geographical dis- 
tribution of ptDNA types and morphologies observed within 
C. striata. Much of the range of var. striata (Fig. 1) was ice-cov- 
ered, and the tundra areas directly to the south were unlikely 
to be hospitable for ecosystems composed of ectomycorrhizal 
forest trees like Abies, Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga, and Quercus 
that are necessary to support populations of C. striata and 
congeners (Pielou 1991). The polytomies within clades C and 
D giving rise to several closely related ptDNA types (Fig. 2) 
is a pattern consistent with rapid, relatively recent expansion 
from glacial refugia. On a regional scale, more ptDNA types 
for clade D are found in the western U.S.A. (Fig. 2), identi- 
fying this region as a likely candidate refugium or series of 
refugia. However, it remains to be explored whether the west- 
ern U.S.A. in fact served as a glacial refugium for members of 
clades B, C, and D. Demographic and coalescent-based anal- 
yses using multiple nuclear loci will be employed in future 
studies, to test hypotheses concerning locations and timing of 
glacial refugia and range expansion /contraction. 
Clade B in the western Sierra Nevada represents a unit of 
evolutionary importance to the C. striata complex, in that it 
is the sister group to the clade that inhabits the remainder of 
North America (i.e. clade C + D, excluding C. bentleyi from 
clade A). It is well known that California is a place of evolu- 
tionary significance for both plants and animals (www.bio- 
diversityhotspots.org; Raven and Axelrod 1978; Takhtajan 
1986; Calsbeek et al. 2003). Several phylogeographic stud- 
ies have identified DNA haplotypes or morphotypes unique 
to California west of the Sierra Nevada, suggesting that this 
mountain range represents a significant barrier to gene flow 
contemporarily, historically, or both (Zink 1991; Zink 1994; 
Wehausen and Ramey 2000; Arbogast et al. 2001; Cicero 
2004). Clade B exhibited floral size characteristics interme- 
diate to those of its sister clade (vars. striata and vreelandii), 
suggesting that for U. S. A. and Canadian populations of C. 
striata (excluding C. bentleyi), this may represent the ancestral 
morphological condition. If this is assumed, then members 
of ptDNA clades C (var. vreelandii) and D (var. striata) would 
have undergone divergent evolution in flower size either by 
genetic drift or selection. 
The presence of C. striata var. vreelandii in western 
Newfoundland is biogeographically important: this variety 
likely had a more continuous distribution in eastern North 
America in the past, just as clade A may have, drawing a partic- 
ular parallel to the situation with C. bentleyi. Many other plant 
species are disjunct from various western North American 
populations to Newfoundland, including numerous bryo- 
phytes (South 1983), three fern species (Polystichum x scopu- 
linum [D. C. Eaton] Maxon, Adiantum aleuticum [Ruprecht] 
Paris, Thelypteris qualpaertensis [H. Christ] Ching), a clubmoss 
(Huperzia miyoshiana [Makino] Ching), and an orchid {Pipería 
unalascensis [Sprengel] Rydberg) (Wagner 1972; J. Maunder 
pers. comm.). These two populations appear to have evolved 
a reproductive strategy of self-pollination. Evidence from sev- 
eral photographs taken of these plants in their native habi- 
tat suggests that seed development occurs in all flowers of 
a raceme, beginning even before the flowers reach anthesisp. 502

(i.e. swollen ovaries on unopened flowers). Furthermore, 
autogamy would be expected to evolve under conditions 
present in Newfoundland, including a shorter growing sea- 
son, small population sizes, immense distances to the near- 
est populations of conspecifics, and (perhaps) lack of suitable 
pollinators (Catling 1990; Grant 1971). 
The extensive variation observed in the C. striata complex 
across North America, in particular the genetic and morpho- 
logical distinctness of ptDNA lineages, illustrates why phy- 
logeographic studies are important for evaluating ranking 
decisions at the specific and infraspecific levels. Findings of 
this study suggest the possibility of three separate species 
within the C. striata complex corresponding to C. bentleyi, 
C. striata var. involuta, and C. striata (including vars. striata, 
vreelandii, and Calif ornian accessions). Furthermore, apparent 
clinal variation in this species complex can be equally well clinal variation in this species complex can be equally well 
explained using discrete plastid DNA lineages. This study explained using discrete plastid DNA lineages. This study 
contributes to a growing body of literature on infraspecific 
variation patterns for North American plants extending into 
Mexico, and will certainly contribute to future taxonomic 
treatment and resulting conservation strategies for these 
orchids.
