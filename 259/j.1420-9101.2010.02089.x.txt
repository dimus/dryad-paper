Introduction
Dioecy, characterized by the presence of separate male and female individuals, has evolved repeatedly among flowering plants, probably in response to selection either for inbreeding avoidance (Charlesworth & Charlesworth, 1978; Freeman et al., 1997) or sexual specialization (Charnov et al., 1976; Freeman et al., 1997). Either way, once plants have evolved separate sexes, we may expect selection to favour further divergence in secondary sexual traits that influence the differential acquisition of resources for each sexual function. Although dioecious plants do not tend to display the striking morphological dimorphism seen in many animal species, some degree of sexual dimorphism in plants is in fact quite common (Willson, 1991). For instance, male and female plants have been found to differ in their vegetative morphology (Geber et al., 1999; Obeso, 2002), phenology (Bullock & Bawa, 1981; Delph, 1990), life history (Geber et al., 1999), physiology (Geber et al., 1999; Case & Ashman, 2005) and allocation to defence (Cornelissen & Stiling, 2005).
Secondary sexual divergence in plants may imply that males and females ultimately occupy divergent niches within their environment, specialising in harvesting different resources; this has been termed ‘the Jack Sprat

effect’ (Onyekwelu & Harper, 1979; Cox, 1981). In the extreme, such an effect can lead to spatial segregation of the sexes in a spatially heterogeneous habitat (Bierzychudek & Eckhart, 1988). For example, in several wellstudied dioecious species, males occupy drier microsites than their female counterparts, probably as a consequence of differences in water-use efficiency (Dawson & Bliss, 1989; Dawson & Ehleringer, 1993) and ⁄ or relative competitive ability (Cox, 1981; Eppley, 2006). Even where spatial segregation of the sexes is not evident, males and females may occupy different micro-niches (Delph & Meagher, 1995).
The occupation of different environmental niches by males and females, e.g. because of their need to harvest different resources at different times, or perhaps even by becoming associated with different soil microbes, suggests that each sex might in turn modify its local niche differently. However, we are unaware of any studies that have explored this idea. Some research has found evidence for differential competitive abilities of males and females, which of course implies a certain degree of niche divergence (Eppley, 2006). But what might such divergence mean for the niche partitioning of the environment experienced by the next generation of individuals? Answers to this question would throw light on factors that affect phenotypic variation in dioecious populations; they might also illustrate the way in which plants with different phenotypes more generally contribute to niche heterogeneity in plant communities.
Here, we ask whether males and females of dioecious populations of the wind-pollinated annual herb
Abstract
Males and females of dioecious plants often differ in morphological, physiological and life-history traits, probably as a result of their different requirements for reproduction. We found that the growth and reproductive effort of individuals of the dioecious herb Mercurialis annua depended on whether males or females had been growing in the soil previously. This suggests that males and females of M. annua differentially modify the soil in which they are growing. Our study indicates that sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants can give rise to increased environmental heterogeneity as a consequence of sex-specific niche modification.

Mercurialis annua differentially modify the growth potential of conspecific individuals that subsequently occupy their soil. Males of M. annua begin flowering several days earlier than females, but both genders then continue to grow and flower indeterminately until plants die (Pannell, 1997). Males tend to be smaller than females, most likely as a result of sex-differential trade-offs between reproduction and growth, attributable not only to differences in the timing of flowering but also to differences in their relative use of nitrogen and carbon (Harris & Pannell, 2008). Because pollen of M. annua is particularly rich in nitrogen (Harris & Pannell, 2008), we might expect males to have been selected to deplete soil nutrient reserves more than females, so that plants growing in soil previously occupied by males would grow less well than those growing in soil previously occupied by females. Alternatively, because females are larger than males, we might expect them to deplete the soil of nutrients more than males. We test these two alternative hypotheses by measuring the growth of M. annua individuals in soil previously occupied by conspecific males vs. females for different periods of time.
Material and methods
For this experiment, we used seeds from a large dioecious population of M. annua near Castelldefels in northeastern Spain. We first grew males and females in individual 9 cm · 9 cm · 10 cm pots filled with peat-based soil (Astro Universal, Goundrey’s Oxford, UK) for three, five, seven, nine or 11 weeks. We grew two replicates of each of the ten respective treatment combinations (sex · growth period) in each of 14 different blocks, set up in a randomised block design on glasshouse benches. After their allotted growth period, we removed each plant from its pot, ensuring that roots were clean of soil, so that all root material, but not soil, was removed from the pots. The soil from all pots was disturbed similarly during the process of root removal. At the end of this first phase, we returned the soil to its respective pots.
For the second phase of the experiment, we established seedlings grown from seeds from the same original population in individual cells of seed trays. All seedlings had begun flowering approximately three weeks after germination. At this point, we transferred them with their soil plug into the soil depleted during phase one, with males and females randomly transplanted into ‘male soil’ and ‘female soil’ depleted for different periods of time in a fully balanced design. One replicate for each of the 20 treatment combinations (plant sex · ‘soil sex’ · duration of growth during the first phase of the experiment) was distributed among 14 blocks (maintaining the identity of blocks from phase one). Again, the experiment was set up using a randomised block design. We recorded the height of all plants at the time of randomisation.
After seven weeks’ growth in the experimental pots, all plants were harvested, and their above-ground vegetative and reproductive biomasses (i.e. flowers and ⁄ or fruits) were measured. We tested for the effects of soil depleted by male vs. female growth (‘soil sex’), and the ‘duration’ of depletion (previous growth duration) on above-ground vegetative and total biomass and reproductive effort (RE, reproductive biomass divided by above-ground vegetative biomass) of conspecific males and females (‘plant sex’), using a general linear mixedeffects model with interactions; ‘soil sex’, ‘plant sex’ and ‘duration’ were fixed factors, and block was a random factor. We included initial height at the time of randomisation as a covariate. Above-ground vegetative and total biomass were log10-transformed to meet the assumptions of analysis (i.e. Normality of standardized residuals and homogeneity of variances). All of our

Plants growing in soil previously depleted by females were smaller in terms of their above-ground vegetative and their total biomass and had greater reproductive effort than those growing in soil depleted by males (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Plants growing in soil depleted for a longer period of time also tended to be smaller, in terms of both above-ground vegetative biomass and total biomass (Table 1, Fig. 1). Irrespective of soil type or depletion period, males were consistently smaller than females, in terms of both above-ground vegetative and total biomass, and displayed greater reproductive effort than females (Table 1, Fig. 2).
Discussion
Our experiment shows that males and females of M. annua modify the soil in which they are growing differently, in a way that differentially affects both the size and the reproductive effort of conspecific individuals that subsequently grow in the same soil. Given previous work that has shown differences in resource use by males and females of dioecious plants (Freeman et al., 1976; Dawson & Bliss, 1989; Dawson & Ehleringer, 1993), including M. annua (Harris & Pannell, 2008), our results are perhaps not too surprising. After all, if males and females harvest resources from their soil at different rates, this must affect the availability of resources for future growth. Nevertheless, our result is important because it specifically draws attention to the way individuals of different sexes can modify their local environment differently, with direct consequences for the growth and allocation strategies of individuals that come to occupy the same space later.
There is now a large literature on secondary sexual differences between males and females of dioecious

plants (reviewed in Geber et al., 1999; and see Introduction). There is also a burgeoning literature in the field of ‘community genetics’, in which it has become clear that different genotypes of the same species can have different effects on the growth and behaviour of individuals not
only of their own species but also of other species (Whitham et al., 2003); this phenomenon has been variously referred to in terms of, ‘niche construction’, ‘niche-changing’ or even ‘extended phenotypes’ (Dawkins, 1982, 2004; Odling-Smee, 1988). Given that,

by definition, males and females of sexually dimorphic species differ from one another more than from individuals of the same sex (and likely more than individuals of sexually monomorphic populations), the potential for differential niche modification (the term we would prefer) in such species would seem to be large. However, to our knowledge, the possibility that sexual dimorphism has implications for environmental (i.e. niche) heterogeneity has not been investigated before.
We found that females of M. annua reduced the growth potential of plants subsequently growing in their soil more than did males, presumably by depleting the soil of its nutrient reserves. One might have expected that males would deplete their soil more rapidly, given that they invest much larger quantities of nutrients, specifically nitrogen, towards reproduction than do females (Harris & Pannell, 2008). However, our result is probably explained by the fact that females of M. annua tend to be larger than males (Harris & Pannell, 2008), thus requiring larger reserves for shoot and leaf growth. If this interpretation is correct, i.e. that size affects belowground reserves more than whether investment is made towards pollen or seeds, then it would be relatively easy to generalize our result to other species. In dioecious herbs such as M. annua, in which females are the larger gender (Obeso, 2002), we would predict more rapid depletion of soil nutrient by females than males. The reverse would hold for woody dioecious species (Obeso, 2002). Either way, we expect to see differences in the environment experienced by organisms during and⁄or after the growth of males vs. females of dioecious plants. Any such differences should contribute to establishing and maintaining environmental heterogeneity, with potential implications for the maintenance of species richness (Huston, 1979; Levine & HilleRisLambers, 2009), perhaps particularly for soil microbial communities (Eisenhauer et al., 2010).
We end by noting that our experiment was conducted under rather artificial conditions, with plants growing in potted soil in a glasshouse. It is possible that the differential capacity of males and females for niche modification will manifest itself differently in more natural environments, e.g. because of nutrient diffusion and ⁄ or nutrient cycling (Angers & Caron, 1998). Consequently, we would encourage further studies assessing the soil environment around males and females in natural dioecious populations, which should be coupled with experimental approaches to rule out the potential different germination and growth of males and females in different soil types. It would be particularly interesting to quantify correlates of biodiversity in invertebrate and microbial communities associated with dioecious plants. Such work, drawing on ideas from community genetics, would go a step beyond studies that, for example, have found evidence for sex-specific herbivory in dioecious plants (Cornelissen & Stiling, 2005). They would also provide a basis, under natural conditions, for extending
the Jack Sprat effect beyond the males and females to which the term was coined to refer (Onyekwelu & Harper, 1979; Cox, 1981).
