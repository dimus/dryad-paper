Abstract
DNA-based techniques have proven useful for defining trophic links in a variety of ecosystems and recently developed sequencing technologies provide new opportunities for dietary studies. We investigated the diet of Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) by pyrosequencing prey DNA from faeces collected at three breeding colonies across the seals’ range. DNA from 270 faecal samples was amplified with four polymerase chain reaction primer sets and a blocking primer was used to limit amplification of fur seal DNA. Pooled amplicons from each colony were sequenced using the Roche GS-FLX platform, generating > 20 000 sequences. Software was developed to sort and group similar sequences. A total of 54 bony fish, 4 cartilaginous fish and 4 cephalopods were identified based on the most taxonomically informative amplicons sequenced (mitochondrial 16S). The prevalence of sequences from redbait (Emmelichthys nitidus) and jack mackerel (Trachurus declivis) confirm the importance of these species in the seals’ diet. A third fish species, blue mackerel (Scomber australasicus), may be a more important prey species than previously recognised. There were major differences in the proportions of prey DNA recovered in faeces from different colonies, probably reflecting differences in prey availability. Parallel hard-part analysis identified largely the same main prey species as did the DNAbased technique, but with lower species diversity and no remains from cartilaginous prey. The pyrosequencing approach presented significantly expands the capabilities of DNA-based methods of dietary analysis and is suitable for large-scale diet investigations on a broad range of animals.

Introduction
Trophic connections in biological communities define ecosystem structure and determining these links has been the goal of numerous ecological studies (Pimm 2002). Methods used to study animal diet are diverse and include gut content analysis (e.g. Young et al. 1997), identification of hard remains in faecal samples (e.g. Burger et al. 1999), analysis of tissue fatty acid signatures (e.g. Iverson et al. 2004), analysis of tissue stable isotope ratios (e.g. Cherel et al. 2007) and observations of feeding events (e.g. Bowen et al. 2002). This diversity of methods reflects the high level

of interest in understanding trophic links and the fact that no methods are universally adequate.
A recent addition to the methods available for dietary analysis is the application of DNA-based techniques to identify prey via DNA recovered from stomach contents or faeces (for reviews, see Symondson 2002; King et al. 2008). This approach has been investigated in a wide range of species, from terrestrial and marine invertebrates to birds and mammals. Two general approaches based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been utilised: species-specific detection methods (e.g. Harper et al. 2005), and a groupspecific approach where dietary DNA is amplified with relatively conserved prey-specific primers and resultant amplicons are identified by sequencing (Jarman et al. 2004; Tollit et al. in press). Both approaches have limitations. The development of species-specific tests is time-consuming

and primer sets are generally not transferable between studies. In addition, potential differences in sensitivity of PCR tests make comparison between data sets difficult. The group-specific approach is constrained by the cost of cloning and sequencing. Also, several sets of group-specific primers are usually needed to survey dietary diversity while avoiding amplification of predator DNA which is prevalent in dietary samples (e.g. Tollit et al. in press). These difficulties have limited the scope and scale of studies carried out to date.
Among vertebrates, pinnipeds are the group of predators for which DNA-based methods of diet analysis have been applied most extensively. Detailed dietary information from these top-level predators is critical for implementation of conservation objectives such as limiting competition between pinnipeds and fisheries, establishing effective marineprotected areas and monitoring and promoting recovery of endangered populations of pinnipeds and/or their prey. The conventional method of diet analysis for pinnipeds is morphological identification of diagnostic remains (cephalopod beaks, fish otoliths and bones) in faecal samples (e.g. Olesiuk 1993; Littnan et al. 2007). However, using this approach misses prey species whose hard-parts do not withstand digestion and those whose hard-parts are not consumed (Jobling 1987; Gales & Cheal 1992; Bowen 2000). Furthermore, feeding trials carried out with captive pinnipeds have revealed up to tenfold differences in prey hard-part recovery rates due to interspecific variation in the robustness of hard-parts (Tollit et al. 1997). Due to these inadequacies, DNA-based faecal analysis has been investigated in harbour seals (Purcell et al. 2004; Kvitrud et al. 2005), grey seals (Parsons et al. 2005; Matejusova et al. 2008), Steller sea lions (Deagle et al. 2005; Tollit et al. in press) and fur seals (Casper et al. 2007a, b). Results from captive-feeding trails show that prey DNA is more consistently recovered from faeces compared to prey hard-parts (Casper et al. 2007a) and indicate that proportions of recovered DNA may provide semi-quantitative dietary data (Deagle & Tollit 2007). Taxonomic resolution of DNA data can also be superior to those obtained from hard-part remains. For example, using diagnostic hard-parts, salmonid species consumed by pinnipeds can only be identified to family level, whereas several studies have now employed genetic markers to obtain species-level identification (Purcell et al. 2004; Kvitrud et al. 2005; Matejusova et al. 2008; Tollit et al. in press).
Recent technological developments have the potential to transform DNA-based diet studies. New sequencing technologies can provide an unprecedented amount of sequence data at a low cost (Hudson 2008). For example, current Genome Sequencer (GS)-FLX pyrosequencing technology (also known as 454 sequencing) is capable of generating 100 million bp of sequence in approximately 250 base pair (bp) reads over a 7.5-h analytical run (Margulies
et al. 2005; Wheeler et al. 2008). High-throughput sequencing technologies are well suited to dietary analysis because they provide sequence data from individual DNA molecules in complex mixtures without the need for cloning, plus they utilise short DNA fragments characteristic of those amplifiable from stomach contents or faeces (Valentini et al. 2009a). PCR primer blocking is another recently developed technique useful for DNA-based diet studies (Vestheim & Jarman 2008). This method can suppress PCR amplification of predator DNA molecules, allowing more inclusive primer sets to be used for amplification of prey DNA from dietary samples. Here, we combined GS-FLX pyrosequencing with the PCR blocking method to analyse prey DNA present in Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) faeces. The general approach we present provides a template for future large-scale DNA-based studies of animal diet.
The diet of Australian fur seals has been studied previously by conventional hard-part analysis (Hume et al. 2004; Littnan et al. 2007; Kirkwood et al. 2008). However, given the limitations associated with hard-part data, significant uncertainties remain. Questions we hoped to address using DNA-based faecal analysis were: (i) Do sharks, skates and/ or rays form a significant portion of the diet? This is presently unknown since cartilage does not survive digestion. (ii) Are more large-bodied, commercially important fish consumed than currently recognised? Seals may eat only the flesh and entrails of large fish, and not heads, which contain the species-specific otoliths, jaws and teeth. (iii) How is it that the seals are benthic foragers (based on diving data, Arnould & Hindell 2001) but consume largely pelagic prey? Are they consuming a prey that is not being detected, or are the species we consider to be pelagic being captured in a benthic environment?
Methods
Overview of faecal genetic analysis
The population-level diet barcoding procedure we followed is outlined in Fig. 1. It involves collecting and extracting DNA from faecal samples, PCR-amplifying informative markers from these samples, pooling the amplicons and sequencing the pooled metasample using the GS-FLX platform. The resultant sequences are then sorted and identified by comparison to a reference database. Details are outlined below.
Study populations, collection of samples and DNA extraction
The Australian fur seal breeds at about 10 locations, all in southeastern Australia (Fig. 2). We collected faecal samples between 27 December 2007 and 24 January 2008 at three colonies which together contain 67% of the population

(Kirkwood et al. 2005): Seal Rocks (25%; 38°30′S, 145°10′E), Lady Julia Percy Island (30%; 38°42′S, 142°00′E) and The Skerries (12%; 37°45′S, 149°31′E). These colonies are adjacent to different potential foraging habitats; the relatively shallow shelf waters of Bass Strait (Seal Rocks), a narrow continental shelf influenced by the warm East Australia Current (The Skerries) and a narrow continental shelf influenced by the cooler South Australian Current (Lady Julia Percy).
At each location, moist faecal samples were collected for both hard-part (n = 35) and DNA (n = 90) extractions. Whole faecal deposits were obtained for hard-part extractions and stored frozen until processed using standard procedures (see Kirkwood et al. 2008). For DNA extraction, approximately 50 mL of faecal material was sub-sampled from lobes of individual faecal deposits, mixed thoroughly in 50 mL of 95% ethanol and stored in 100 mL screw-top vials. DNA was extracted from the amorphous soft matrix component of sub-samples (50–100 mg) within 60 days of collection using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN), as described previously (Deagle et al. 2005). Extraction blanks were included with each batch of 90 extractions to monitor for cross-contamination. The DNA was eluted in 100 μL Tris buffer (10 mm) and diluted 1:5 in distilled water prior to PCR.
Genetic marker selection and PCR primers
A critical step in any DNA-based diet study is selection of suitable DNA barcoding markers and corresponding conserved PCR primers. The Barcode of Life project has obtained cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence data in many Australian fish, providing an excellent set of reference sequences for our purposes (Ward et al. 2005, 2008). Lamentably, amplification of mixed DNA template from faeces requires minimally degenerate primers that amplify a short DNA fragment (Deagle et al. 2006) and it is not possible to design suitable PCR primers within the proteincoding COI gene (Fig. 3, Vences et al. 2005). We therefore made use of conserved primers which amplify variable regions of ribosomal DNA genes. Four separate PCR amplifications were carried out on each faecal DNA extraction (Primer Sets A–D; Table 1 and described below). Each PCR amplifies DNA from a different range of potential prey species, varying in scope from cephalopods to all Bilateria. There was redundancy in the prey groups targeted by different PCR amplifications allowing comparison between data sets. Adaptor sequences were added to the 5'-end of the primers to make them compatible with the GS-FLX sequencing process (Table 1). The primer sets used in the four PCR amplifications are:

 Primer Set A: ~250 bp mtDNA 16S (Chordata and Cephalopoda)
These primers are based on those described by Dunshea et al. (2008) (16SPLSU FW and Rv mix). They amplify ~250 bp of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 16S rRNA gene in the major prey groups previously identified in the fur seal diet (bony fish and cephalopods). To incorporate minor variation in cephalopod and fish primer binding region an equimolar mixture of two forward and two reverse degenerate primers were used in the PCR (Table 1).
Primer Set B: ~100 bp mtDNA 16S (Chordata)
This PCR utilised the forward primer from Primer Set A matching the chordate binding region with an alternate
reverse primer that was designed to amplify a shorter mtDNA 16S fragment (∼100 bp) from fishes (including bony fish, sharks and rays). This primer set was designed based on an alignment of 100 teleost fish (see Fig. 3) and representative sharks and rays. These primers also amplify DNA of other chordates, including pinnipeds. They were tested on genomic DNA from fish species not present in Australian costal waters (Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii; walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma; myctophid, Krefftichthys anderssoni) and representative faecal samples.
Primer Set C: 28S rDNA (Cephalopoda)
These primers were designed to amplify a region of the nuclear 28S rDNA gene from cephalopods, based on alignment of available sequence data and representative

Regions of low entropy along the 16S fragment enable the design of conserved PCR primers; this is not possible within the COI region. Approximate position of primers in sets A and B used in the current study (see Table 1) are shown along the 16S fragment.

outgroups. Primers were tested on Californian market squid (Loligo opalescence) and representative faecal samples. Several cephalopod-specific primer sets targeting the mtDNA 16S gene were designed, but PCR of faecal samples with these did not produce strong amplifications (data not shown).
Primer Set D: 18S rDNA (Bilateria)
This primer set is the most conserved, amplifying DNA from a wide range of Bilateria ( Jarman et al. 2004). Sequences from this fragment should encompass all potential prey as well as parasites present in the faecal samples. The taxonomic resolution is low but should provide a broad idea of the groups present in the sample ( Jarman et al. 2004).
Blocking primer
Since predator DNA is typically more prevalent than prey DNA in the predator’s faeces, a blocking primer approach was employed to inhibit fur seal DNA amplification in PCR using Primer Sets A and B (Vestheim & Jarman 2008). This method uses a modified non-extendable primer that binds to predator mtDNA, but not target species. The blocking primer used here overlaps with the 3′-end of the forward PCR primer and prevents the PCR primer from effectively binding to fur seal DNA (see Fig. S1, Supporting information for blocking primer sequence and alignments). The blocking primer was included at 10 times the concentration of PCR primers during amplification. Primer Set D also amplifies fur seal DNA, but the amplicon is not

variable enough to make a blocking primer that only suppresses fur seal sequence amplification.
PCR amplification of prey DNA from faeces
Before final amplifications of PCR products for GS-FLX sequencing, preliminary checks were run on a subset of samples. First, a clone library analysis was carried out to ensure the Primer Sets A–D were amplifying prey DNA and that the primer blocking method was working to minimise amplification of predator DNA. This involved amplifying a mixture of DNA from six faecal extractions with each of the four primer sets and cloning the amplicons using TOPO TA Cloning (Invitrogen). Eight sequences were obtained from each cloning reaction and all sequences were from within the expected target groups.
The second preliminary check was to determine reaction profiles for each primer set in a subset of faecal samples (n = 24) using real-time SYBR Green based assays. This was done so that final reactions could be stopped during the exponential stage of amplification to minimise differential amplification bias which is potentially produced as the PCR nears the plateau phase. Real-time amplifications were run for 40 cycles using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN) and the Chromo4 detection system (MJ Research). Based on these data, subsequent PCR amplifications were stopped at cycle 33 which corresponds to the exponential phase for primer sets in > 90% of samples tested.
Final PCR amplifications were carried out independently (i.e. 1080 separate PCRs plus negative controls). These PCR reactions were performed using the Multiplex PCR Kit with HotStar Taq DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN). All primers (PCR and blocking) were purified via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to remove truncated products. Each PCR (10 μL) contained 5 μL Multiplex PCR Master Mix, 0.25 μm of each primer, 2.5 μm blocking primer (if present) and 4 μL template DNA. Thermal cycling conditions were: 95 °C for 15 min followed by 33 cycles of: 94 °C for 20 s, a primerspecific annealing temperature (see Table 1) for 90 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. There followed a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. All products were checked on 1.8% agarose gels and the amount of DNA in positive reactions was quantified by fluorescence of PicoGreen in a PicoFluor fluorometer (Turner Designs).
Preparation of pooled sample for 454 sequencing
To ensure approximately equal contribution from each sample in the pyrosequencing results, equimolar mixes of PCR products from Primer Sets A–D were made for each collection locality. The DNA in each distinct amplicon mixture was quantified again and mixed to create three metasamples (one for each sampling locality) containing PCR products from all primer sets (Fig. 1). The molar ratio
of the four PCR products in the final pooled samples was 6:6:1:4 (corresponding to Primer Sets A:B:C:D). The mixture was weighted towards amplicons from Primer Sets A and B since these sequences provide the best taxonomic resolution and cover the main prey groups. The three metasamples were sent to Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) for sequencing using the Roche GS-FLX (454) platform. Sequencing data were obtained from three regions of a small PicoTitre Plate separated by gaskets; this is equivalent to 3/16 of the standard GS-FLX full plate. Each plate region contained all PCR products from faeces collected at a particular fur seal colony (Seal Rocks, Lady Julia Percy Island or The Skerries). All reads started from GS-FLX adapter primer A.
Processing and analysis of 454 sequence data
The sequence sorting and clustering procedure outlined here was largely executed by purpose-written software which is available from the authors. The initial step of data processing was to discard sequence reads without an exact match to one of the PCR primers adjacent to the GS-FLX sequencing primer. Remaining sequences were partitioned into four amplicon-specific libraries based on their PCR primer sequence. Further sequences were excluded based on the length of the read. For amplicons from Primer Set A all reads < 140 bp were discarded as these short fragment are less likely to contain reliable taxonomic information. The short length of amplicons from Primer Set B (~100 bp) meant that the vast majority of reads covered the complete fragment; therefore for this library, any sequences that did not contain exact matches to both the forward and reverse PCR primers were discarded. For the two remaining amplicon-specific libraries, fragments C and D, which had a lower information density, reads less than 200 bp were discarded.
Once sequences had passed through this preliminary screening, they were sorted by similarity to known sequences and by similarity to each other. An initial database of sequences from previously identified common prey was constructed for each amplicon. Each sequence in the ampliconspecific libraries was then compared to all sequences in the prey database for that fragment. The comparison involved making a pairwise alignment with ClustalW (Thompson et al. 1994) with gap opening and extension parameters of 10 and 0.5, respectively, and then calculating the LogDet DNA distance (Lockhart etal. 1994) between the two sequences. The closest match in the prey library under the arbitrary threshold of 0.05 LogDet distance was provisionally taken as the best estimate of sequence identity. Any sequences that did not have a match in the pre-defined database were grouped into mutually exclusive clusters of sequences with not more than 0.05 LogDet units difference amongst them. The sequences within groups were aligned

and visually checked for distinct sequences to make sure that multiple species were not grouped within the 0.05 LogDet threshold. Representative sequences from clusters were used to search GenBank with blastn (Altschul et al. 1990) and the best identification possible was made by similarity with sequences in GenBank. The new prey sequences were added to the prey sequence database, and final assignment of sequences in the amplicon-specific libraries was made by comparison of each sequence to the updated database, with sequences being assigned to the closest match under the 0.05 threshold.
While sorting of amplicon sequences and clustering based on similarity can be automated, some aspects of classification were performed manually. In the final classifications, we considered factors such as the geographic distribution of species identified by the closest blast hit and the diversity of closely related species in southeastern Australia (including related species with no sequences in the database). For example, blue mackerel Scomber australasicus could not be differentiated from other Scomber species using the mtDNA 16S sequence, but is the only member of the genus present in the area. Apparently clear-cut blast matches also needed to be assessed. For example, an exact match of recovered mtDNA 16S sequence to a single leatherjacket species in the genus Acanthaluteres was ambiguous since two species in the genus are common in Bass Strait and sequence data were available for only one. Hand-curating of results is a lengthy process but no alternatives are presently available.
Generation of prey mtDNA 16S sequence database
To aid in identification of sequences obtained from the fur seal faecal samples mtDNA 16S sequences were obtained from specimens of 48 fish species found in the Bass Strait region (see Table S1, Supporting information for list of species names). Fish species previously identified in the seal’s diet were the primary focus. Most tissue samples (n = 44) were obtained from voucher specimens stored at the Australian National Fish Collection (CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, Tasmania) and are part of a DNA barcoding project (Ward et al. 2005, 2008). DNA was extracted using the chelex extraction protocol (following Small et al. 1998). PCR products were generated using the primers 16Sar-5′ and 16Sbr-3′ (Palumbi 1996); these primers amplify the 3′ region of the mtDNA 16S gene and encompass the sequence amplified by Primer Sets A and B (Table 1). DNA was not extracted from these prey tissue samples until after the pyrosequencing samples had been sent away for analysis, to ensure faecal samples could not be inadvertently contaminated in the laboratory. Direct sequencing of PCR products and capillary separation was performed at the AGRF, and resultant sequences submitted to GenBank (Accession numbers in Table S1).
Results
Hard-part analysis
Of 105 faecal samples sorted for hard-parts, 80 (76%) contained recognisable prey items. A total of 420 individual prey from 29 separate prey groups were recognised. Of the samples with recognisable prey, 40% (32) had just one recognisable prey group, 13% (10) contained more than three prey groups and the maximum number of prey groups from a single sample was eight. Eleven of the prey groups were represented by single prey items, while redbait (n = 197, 47%, Emmelichthys nitidus) and jack mackerel (n = 110, 26%, Trachurus declivis) dominated the samples (Table 2).
Overview of GS-FLX data
The GS-FLX 454 sequencing run generated > 30 000 DNA sequences in 3 × 1/16th plate regions; 22 300 of the sequences were of amplicons from the current study. Following screening, 17 480 sequences remained in the data set (Table 3). Similar numbers of sequences were obtained from each region, and the number of sequences obtained for each amplicon was also relatively consistent. The proportion of sequences from each amplicon differed from the expected ratios based on molar ratios of template submitted for sequencing. Sequences from amplicons produced by Primer Sets B and C were over-represented, suggesting a template specific sequencing bias.
Sequences from Primer Set A: ~250 bp mtDNA 16S (Chordata and Cephalopoda)
Primer Set A produced PCR amplicons from 65% of the faecal DNA samples and a total of 3347 sequences were obtained. In these data 47 closely related sequence clusters were identified (Table 4). Potential prey were identified in 44 sequence clusters; this included 31 fish, 3 cephalopods and 2 birds that could be identified to genus or species level, and 8 other taxa that were identified to higher taxonomic groups (Table 4). Sequences from four bony fish comprised 71% of the potential prey sequences; redbait (33.0%), jack mackerel (22.8%), barracouta (9.1%; Thyrsites atun) and blue mackerel (7.2%; Scomber australasicus). The two most common cephalopod sequences were from arrow squid (6.3%; Nototodarus gouldi) and southern calamari squid (3.8%; Sepioteuthis australis). A shark (0.6%; unknown species) and the southern eagle ray (0.2%; Myliobatis australis) were also identified; neither of these had previously been reported in data from hard-part analysis of faeces. Single DNA sequences from two bird species were detected. These could represent dietary items, but are more likely contamination from bird faeces which was prevalent at the sites.

 Of the non-prey sequences, one cluster of 865 sequences (26% of data) matched fur seal mtDNA, indicating the blocking primer was not completely effective. However, it is probable that the blocking primer substantially inhibited the amplification of fur seal DNA given that previous qPCR analysis of mtDNA in pinniped faeces showed that at this fragment size predator mtDNA is on average 25 times more prevalent than prey mtDNA (Deagle et al. 2006). Another cluster of 37 sequences had 90% similarity to mtDNA 16S gene sequences from a variety of pinnipeds and is presumably a nuclear mitochondrial pseudogene (see Dunshea et al. 2008 for discussion). Contaminating human DNA sequences (n = 29; < 1% of data) were also present. A previous pyrosequencing study reported similar levels of human DNA sequence contamination (2.4%, Binladen et al. 2007). The final 2% of sequences could not be assigned, these either had < 85% max identity in blast searches, < 90% query coverage (includes some chimeric sequences) or were bacterial in origin.
Sequences from Primer Set B: ~100 bp mtDNA 16S (Chordata)
With Primer Set B over 90% of the extractions produced PCR amplicons — a higher success rate than for Primer Set A which targets a wider group of prey. The increased ability of Primer Set B to recover prey DNA is most likely due to the smaller size of the amplicon (see Deagle et al. 2006). In the data set of 11 524 sequences, 64 closely related sequence clusters were obtained (listed in Table S2, Supporting information).
A total of 55 fish taxa were identified (42 to genus or species level). This includes 34 of the 37 fish identified with Primer Set A. The most common four fish species were the same as for Primer Set A and were present in similar proportions (Fig. 4). The 21 new fish identified were all rare sequences, which made up less than 2% of all fish sequences in this amplicon library. These data included a small number of sequences from two additional Chondrichthyes

Perhaps the blocking primer was more effective in this primer set, or the result may simply reflect that in smaller DNA fragments there is more prey DNA relative to predator DNA (Deagle et al. 2006).
In the large number of sequences obtained with Primer Set B there was an increased diversity of contaminating sequences (Table S2).

These totalled only 0.1% of sequences and included: pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). The first two species were used in preliminary PCR primer testing while genomic DNA from the other two species was being extracted in the laboratory.
Sequences from Primer Set C: 28S rDNA (Cephalopoda)
Primer Set C produced amplicons from only 32% of the faecal templates (Table 3). This gene fragment was not particularly variable, and thus, the level of taxonomic information that could be retrieved was low, with sequences being reliably assignable only to ordinal level. This allowed distinction between three major groups of cephalopods. Of the 2195 sequences analysed, 84% were from Teuthida (squid), 15% from Octopoda (octopus) and 1% from Sepiida (cuttlefish) (Table S2). The proportion of Octopoda was higher than shown by results from Primer Set A (15% vs. 3%). One sequence was from a decapod crustacean, indicating slight primer leakage (0.045% of the total).
Sequences from Primer Set D: 18S rDNA (Bilateria)
Primer Set D produced amplicons from 94% of samples. The high PCR success rate was probably due to the fact that the primers amplify fur seal DNA and, unlike the procedure used for Primer Sets A and B, no blocking primer was used. Primer Set D has a very broad taxonomic specificity, but the region it amplifies is not especially variable. The taxonomic resolution of this fragment was either to class or order level, depending upon the group in question. Eighteen taxonomic groups were identified in the 690 sequences obtained, 595 of these being unequivocally food derived (Table S2).
The DNA sequences identified came mainly from Actinopterygii (ray finned fish, 68%) and cephalopods (14%). Smaller contributions came from Chondrichthyes (0.3%),
Fig. 5 Distribution of GS-FLX sequence read lengths for amplicons from two nuclear rDNA markers (produced with Primer Sets C and D). The amplicons have a very similar length range. Almost all sequence reads from Primer Set C are longer than 200 bp. Primer Set D produced a large number of short reads that occurred at regions of repetitive high GC% sequence in sequences apparently derived from mammals and fish.
various Crustacea (Decapoda 1.0%, Cyclopoda at 0.6% and Isopoda 0.1%), Thaliacea (pelagic tunicates, 1.0%) and Ascidacea (sea squirts, 0.6%). The small-bodied species identified probably represent secondary digestion (prey of the prey) or contamination prior to collection. The broad taxonomic range of amplicons produced by this primer set also recorded fur seal gut parasites: Trematoda (2.9%), Cestoda (2.3%) and Nematoda (2.3%). Sequences from Diptera (flies, 2.0%) and Coleoptera (beetles, < 0.1%) were also recovered and probably represented insect activity on the faeces between deposition and collection.
A surprising finding from Primer Set D was the small number of sequences from fur seals, with only 1% (7/690) sequences being unequivocally mammalian. The lowerthan-expected numbers of mammalian sequences can be explained by an apparent bias in sequencing read length with the GS-FLX technology. Sequences of amplicons from Primer Set D contained a large number of short reads, with 50% (710/1400) of the sequences being shorter than the 200 bp cut-off used in our screening procedure due to the low information content of the region (Fig. 5). Only 2% of sequences from Primer Set C (52/2247) were this short despite this amplicon having a similar length range and being from the same rDNA tandem repeat region (Fig. 5). A group of truncated sequences from Primer Set D were ~145 bp in length and matched mammalian reference sequences, presumably these sequences are from fur seals amplicons. Another group of sequences were truncated to near 75 bp and most likely belonging to Percomorpha fish. These truncated sequences were characterised by a median GC% of 64% as compared to 52% for the > 200 bp reads from the same region and had several regions with runs of 4–7 consecutive guanidines or cytosines.
Comparison of DNA sequence data between sampling locations

seal colonies and these differences tended to be congruent between primer sets. Primer Set A and B showed that the most abundant fish prey varied between sites. At Seal Rocks, jack mackerel was most prevalent followed by barracouta; at Lady Julia Percy, redbait was the dominant prey with smaller contributions from jack mackerel and barracouta; at The Skerries, redbait, jack mackerel and blue mackerel were found in almost equal proportions (Fig. 4).
The percentage of cephalopod sequences obtained with Primer Set A varied from 17% of prey sequences at Seal Rocks to 3% at The Skerries (Table 4). This corresponds well to relative abundance based on presence/absence data from Primer Set C (cephalopod DNA was detected in 52% of faecal samples collected at Seal Rocks and only 12% of those collected at The Skerries; Table 3). Primer set D showed the same trends with respect to the three colonies: proportions for Cephalopoda were 43%, 12% and 5% at Seal Rocks, Lady Julia Percy and The Skerries, respectively. Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) sequences were recovered at low levels from Seal Rocks and Lady Julia Percy Island in amplicon libraries from Primer Sets A, B and D (< 1% of sequences in each case) and Chondrichthyes sequences were absent in samples collected at The Skerries for all primer sets.
Comparison between hard-part and DNA methods
Both hard-part and DNA approaches demonstrated the key importance of redbait and jack mackerel as prey species in the diet of Australian fur seals. Moreover, both techniques indicated a predominance of jack mackerel over redbait at Seal Rocks, the opposite relationship at Lady Julia Percy and similar contribution by these prey at The Skerries (Tables 2 and 4). Beyond these two key prey species, direct comparisons between hard-part and DNA data sets is somewhat restricted since different faecal samples were used in each analysis and different numbers of samples were collected; 35 and 90 for hard-part and DNA-based analyses, respectively. Also, to simplify the comparison between techniques, we provide just a numerical abundance analysis of prey based on hard-parts, which does not incorporate frequency of occurrence across samples nor biomass estimates based on prey size estimates. A disparity here is that larger-bodied prey may contribute more DNA but the same number of otoliths as a smaller bodied prey. Still, the results do show a pattern consistent with suspected biases in recovery due to differential digestion, or ingestion, of prey hard-parts. The blue mackerel, which has small and fragile otoliths, was notably more common in the DNA data compared to hard-part data (Tables 2 and 4). Conversely, prey that have solid hard-parts, such as leatherjacket (Monocanthidae; possessing resilient teeth) and red cod (Pseudophycis bachus; with thick, heavy otoliths) were more common in the hard-part data set. Also, seals are known to
break large prey into smaller pieces prior to consumption and may avoid swallowing large, hard or spiky heads. Species with these features include pink ling (Genypterus blacodes), barracouta, some gurnards and several perch. These prey were recorded more often in the DNA data (Tables 2 and 4). Four species of Chondrichthyes were detected using DNA. None was recognised in hard-part analysis, which was not surprising since cartilaginous skeletons are susceptible to digestion.
Discussion
Pyrosequencing of prey DNA from faecal samples
The application of high-throughput sequencing will significantly expand the scope of many molecular ecology studies and these methods are particularly applicable to research examining trophic interactions using DNA markers (Valentini et al. 2009b). The major advantage of highthroughput sequencing technology over previous DNAbased approaches used to study diet is the sheer amount of sequencing data that can be produced. It is now possible to analyse hundreds of dietary samples in parallel and with sufficient sequencing coverage to allow detection of even very rare dietary items. To efficiently use the large amount of data generated in each sequencing run, it is necessary to pool DNA amplified from many samples (e.g. Binladen et al. 2007). We pooled amplicons from 90 faecal samples collected at each seal colony and differentiated between samples from each site through physical separation on the reaction plate. Rather than obtaining dietary data from individuals, we obtained dietary data for groups of animals. This population-level information is suitable for ecosystem modelling and many other uses of dietary data. However, if required, individual-level data could be obtained by tracking amplicons from each faecal sample separately using specific coded-PCR primers (Binladen et al. 2007; Meyer et al. 2007). The only added expense would be for the additional PCR primers.
Another advantage of high-throughput sequencing is that proportions of DNA sequences recovered from samples are determined and this may improve quantitative estimates of diet. Similar data can be obtained through clone library analysis (e.g. Passmore et al. 2006) or quantitative PCR (e.g. Deagle & Tollit 2007; Nejstgaard et al. 2008). However, these methods are not as amenable to large field-based studies; instead PCR detection methods have generally been used and only data on the frequency of occurrence of prey DNA in samples is obtained (Harper et al. 2005; Casper et al. 2007b; Tollit et al. in press). To obtain useful quantitative estimates of diet from amplicon libraries, the proportion of DNA recovered from faeces must roughly reflect the proportional biomass of dietary items ingested. Preliminary studies on captive Steller sea lions fed a limited

number of fish prey suggest this may be true in some cases (Deagle & Tollit 2007). However, due to a number of complicating factors, it is unlikely that this simple correspondence will hold across a broad range of predators, prey and DNA markers. One set of difficulties results from the biological differences between prey species. For example, the copy number of multicopy genes targeted in DNA diet studies may vary extensively among genomes or tissues of different species (Prokopowich et al. 2003). In a diet study by Valentini et al. (2009a), chloroplast DNA barcoding markers were recovered from faeces of herbivorous animals. The authors point out that ingested plant leaves are a richer source of chloroplast DNA than roots, fruit, or seeds, and this will contort the quantitative signature. Further data on the variance in DNA density of relevant species are needed to evaluate this source of bias. Another biological feature that could influence the number of sequences recovered relative to biomass of prey consumed is differential susceptibility of prey species to the processes of digestion.
Technical factors can also impact how accurately the proportions of DNA in faecal samples are reflected in the final sequence database. Many microbial ecology studies have highlighted the difficulties in using PCR to obtain quantitative data from complex mixtures of DNA (e.g. von Wintzingerode et al. 1997; Hongoh et al. 2006; Sipos et al. 2007). Of primary importance are the properties of the PCR primers used to amplify markers from mixed DNA template. In the context of dietary studies, strong biases will occur if PCR primer mismatches result in prey-specific differences in amplification efficiency (e.g. Deagle et al. 2007). The application of blocking primers will help in the selection of highly conserved PCR primers (i.e. those less prone to PCR bias), since PCR primers that bind to predator DNA can be used. It is possible to check for evidence of PCR bias by collecting data from multiple primer sets targeting the same prey species; with the large amount of sequence data produced via high-throughput sequencing, this is now a practical option. In the current study, we amplified fish DNA from seal faeces using two separate PCR amplifications of mtDNA. The results are remarkably congruent between PCRs, suggesting that different PCRs targeting the same marker can produce results that are quantitatively consistent. The proportions of fish relative to squid sequences in the mtDNA 16S (Primer Set A) data set vs. the nuclear 28S rDNA (Primer Set D) data set were not as congruent. This inconsistency was at least partially due to a bias in the sequencing efficiency of the different amplicons obtained from Primer Set D. With this primer set, there was a reduction in usable sequences from chordates (including some fish) due to truncated sequence reads. This amplicon-specific sequencing bias was most apparent in the lack of recovered fur seal sequences (only 1% of the sequences); in a previous study on whale faeces using this primer set, 35% of the amplicons came from the predator (Jarman et al. 2004). One
systematic analysis of sequencing biases has been published on data produced with Solexa high-throughput technology (Dohm et al. 2008), but we are unaware of any for the GSFLX system. This is a relatively new technology, and as more data becomes available the causes of sequencing biases will become apparent and might be accounted for.
If the biological and technical biases influencing DNA proportions are not extreme, pyrosequencing of DNA in dietary samples may prove to be the most accurate method available for reconstructing prey contributions to an animals’ diet. The strength of this statement is tempered when one considers the significant difficulties in obtaining accurate dietary data from many predators using other methods. For many invertebrates, few options for obtaining quantitative dietary data exist other than DNA-based analysis (Symondson 2002). For seabirds and cetaceans, minimally invasive methods such as stable isotope or fatty-acid signature analysis of tissue are often used, but these methods provide low taxonomic resolution of the prey consumed and reliability of quantitative data is questionable (Nordstrom et al. 2008). In the analysis of pinniped diet, determining biomass contributions by conventional hard-part analysis of faeces is hindered by the fact that prey hard-parts erode at different rates (e.g. small vs. large otoliths, fish otoliths vs. cephalopod beaks), and some prey have no resilient components. Furthermore, determining biomass contributions requires estimates of prey body size; these are derived from measurements of variably digested hard-parts, introducing additional errors. Differing means of expulsion (regurgitation vs. faeces) also add to the difficulty of hardpart dietary reconstruction. In DNA faecal analysis, all digested prey should be detected, and larger-bodied or frequently eaten prey items are likely to contribute more DNA to the sample. If DNA occurs in comparable densities in consumed prey, survives similarly through digestive processes and can be amplified with appropriate primers, then proportions of DNA sequences extracted should accurately represent biomass contributions. Ultimately, controlled feeding trials (e.g. Deagle et al. 2005) will be required to evaluate how well pyrosequencing data obtained from faecal DNA reflects actual diet composition.
Trophic links of Australian fur seals
In addition to the important technical issues outlined above, consideration must be given to the location, timing and population subset represented by sample collection before inferences are made from dietary studies. In the current study, faeces were sampled at three breeding locations over a period of just 1 month. Australian fur seal diet is known to vary substantially over time (Hume et al. 2004; Kirkwood et al. 2008), and therefore, our data will not reflect annual diet. However, this study does provide unsurpassed detail of the Australian fur seals’ diet from a

single sampling event and provides significant new insights into the trophic roles of this high-level marine predator.
Sequencing of prey DNA in faecal samples can record greater species diversity than are obtainable from other dietary analysis techniques. For example, the single DNA sampling at The Skerries recorded 35 distinct fish groups in 90 faecal samples, whereas in a 3-year study (2001 to 2003) using hard-part analysis of 490 faecal samples, 39 fish groups were recorded (Littnan et al. 2007). DNA analysis also allowed us to determine if Australian fur seals prey on sharks and rays. These prey have not been documented in hard-part analysis and it was not known if this was due to their not being consumed or their cartilaginous skeletons not surviving digestion. In the seals’ faeces, we detected low levels of DNA from the southern eagle ray (Myliobatis australis), a skate and two shark species, indicating that these prey are occasionally eaten. The DNA-based approach also allowed us to independently evaluate if large-bodied and economically important fish species have a higher prevalence in Australian fur seal diet than is recognised by hard-part analysis. The results suggest not, but rather, they confirm that the key prey for the seals are redbait and jack mackerel, which are small-bodied (mostly < 30 cm) and have a low commercial value (Kailola et al. 1993). The relative importance of more economically valuable species does not appear higher than has been previously recognised. Barracouta and flathead species, for example, are verified as being important secondary prey, while key economic species, such as snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), warehou (Seriolella spp.), trevally (Pseudocaranx spp.) and morwong (Family Cheilodactylidae), appear to be occasional prey. The one possible exception is pink ling (Genypterus blacodes). DNA from this species was recorded at all three sites, and it could be a more common prey of Australian fur seal than hardpart analysis has indicated.
One conundrum regarding Australian fur seal foraging ecology has been that dive recorders show that these seals are benthic foragers (Arnould & Hindell 2001) but redbait, jack mackerel, barracouta and arrow squid, which regularly feature in the seals’ top five prey, are largely pelagic. Recognition as being pelagic comes from their forming enormous schools near the surface, which is where fishers predominantly catch them, although the species are also caught in benthic trawls in lower numbers (Kailola et al. 1993). The DNA analysis again suggests that hard-part analysis are not missing major dietary components (also shown by Tollit et al. in press) and confirm the importance of species that have been considered to be pelagic prey to the Australian fur seals. Thus, we speculate that these prey species are principally benthic or demersal rather than pelagic, and are simply more visible and vulnerable to fishing operations during occasional phases of pelagic and near-surface schooling. Further studies to clarify the habits of these prey and the timing of their capture by the seals are required.
In our DNA data, arrow squid stands out as the most prevalent invertebrate prey of Australian fur seals which is in agreement with hard-part analyses. Determination of the relative contribution of fish and squid using hard-part analysis is difficult, since squid beaks are much more prevalent in regurgitates compared to faecal samples (Gales et al. 1993). Uncertainty over the contribution of arrow squid to the seals’ diet has inhibited accurate modelling of trophic interactions between Australian fur seals and fisheries (Goldsworthy et al. 2003). We found arrow squid sequences constituted up to 15% of the mtDNA prey sequences (Primer Set A; recorded at Seal Rocks). Further temporal and spatial assessments are required to accurately monitor the relative contributions of squid to the seals diet, and may now be possible using DNA-based techniques. Crustaceans represent a very minor part of the diet. Results indicate that very small quantities of decapods are consumed. The other crustaceans groups identified (including copepods, isopods and cladocerans sequences) likely represent secondary predation, parasites ingested with host fish (e.g. sea lice), or result from contamination of the faecal samples at the collection site.
This study also reveals geographic variations in Australian fur seal diet that have not previously been recognised. Faecal samples reflect prey consumed within about 200 km (Kirkwood et al. 2008). Thus, the different diets at the sites probably relate to the different oceanographic conditions adjacent to them (oceanography presented in Evans & Middleton 1998; Middleton & Bye 2007). Lady Julia Percy Island lies on a 50-km wide continental shelf that is influenced predominantly by intermediate temperatures of the South Australia Current and up-welling of cold Antarctic surface waters, Seal Rocks is situated > 200 km from a shelf break in northern Bass Strait, where currents are slow and waters have extended residence times, and The Skerries is on a 30-km wide shelf that is influenced mainly by the warm East Australia Current. One obvious geographic difference in diet is that redbait were prevalent in samples from Lady Julia Percy and The Skerries, but not from Seal Rocks. Therefore, redbait appear to be captured predominantly around the shelf break. This distribution accords with a previous finding that redbait were scarce in the seal diet in southern Bass Strait but abundant in southern Tasmanian waters (Hume et al. 2004).
A second geographic variation in prey prevalence is the abundance of barracouta and virtual absence of blue mackerel at both Lady Julia Percy Island and Seal Rocks, and the reverse patterns for these species at The Skerries. This contrast suggests that barracouta prefer the cooler waters of the South Australia Current and up-welling Antarctic Surface Waters, while the blue mackerel prefer warmer waters of the East Australia Current. The importance of blue mackerel to Australian fur seals has not previously been recognised. At The Skerries, blue mackerel were the

third most commonly detected prey, accounting for 25% of DNA sequences from Primer Set A. However, in a 3-year study of seal diet from hard-part analysis at this site between 1999 and 2001, blue mackerel were not recorded (Littnan et al. 2007). Otoliths of blue mackerel were easily recognisable in our hard-part analysis and it is unlikely that they were overlooked in the previous study. Possibly, as with redbait in Bass Strait, blue mackerel availability changes over time within the East Australia Current (Kirkwood et al. 2008).
The assessment of Australian fur seal diet using DNA techniques enhances our knowledge of not only the seals’ trophic roles, but also provides insights into the ecology of prey species. More broadly, this study illustrates how the application of high-throughput sequencing technology in dietary studies can boost sample sizes and the speed of dietary analysis. The approach will aid in the evaluation of technical aspects of DNA-based dietary analysis adding to their applicability for a broad range of diet studies in marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
